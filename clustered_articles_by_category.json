            "content": "Whales withdrew $250 million Bitcoin from exchanges, confirming institutional accumulation and reduced sell pressure.\n\nExchange inflows dominate, but BTC price stability implies strategic repositioning, not panic selling.\n\nBitcoin’s [BTC] recent rally has entered a structured accumulation phase, led by long-term investors rather than retail traders.\n\nThe asset has climbed from the $70K region without hype-driven volatility, signaling a more sustainable momentum shift.\n\nAfter months of sluggish action, Bitcoin now tests a crucial resistance.\n\nPrice remains supported by a strong foundation of institutional demand. Therefore, the current rally may differ from past cycles, where emotional speculation often triggered abrupt peaks.\n\nBitcoin retracts under resistance\n\nBitcoin has broken out of its descending channel, setting the tone for a potential trend reversal.\n\nAt press time, it traded between $76,300 and $87,500 — a tight range forming a textbook accumulation zone. BTC hovered near $85,097, rising 0.68% over the last 24 hours.\n\nHowever, the $87,500 resistance remains a psychological and structural barrier.\n\nA clear break above this level could initiate a move toward $98,000 or even $100,000. Until then, BTC may continue ranging as buyers gradually absorb selling pressure.\n\nWhale activity signals strong conviction\n\nOf course, behind the scenes, large players made bold statements.\n\nA wallet linked to Abraxas Capital has withdrawn 2,949 BTC, worth nearly $250 million, over four days. The latest withdrawal included 505 BTC, valued at $42.64 million, taken from Binance.\n\nThese movements weren’t random. Instead, they reflected deliberate accumulation and reduced supply on exchanges. Naturally, this kind of activity bolsters bullish confidence — especially during consolidation phases.\n\nBesides, BTC saw Net Inflows of +1.26K at the time of writing.\n\nThese inflows currently dominate, as shown by consistent green bars on the flow chart. However, prices remain stable, indicating that these transfers are not intended for immediate selling.\n\nInstead, the activity may reflect internal rebalancing or futures-related strategies.\n\nTherefore, while inflows usually suggest short-term bearish pressure, current market conditions defy that narrative. Liquidity appears controlled, and sell-side pressure remains soft.\n\nWill Bitcoin see further upside?\n\nIn/Out of the Money data showed that 77.52% of holders were in profit at press time.\n\nOnly 16.79% remained out of the money, reducing the chances of forced selling. This metric reveals that price was near—but not yet in—resistance-heavy zones between $86K and $106K.\n\nThe NVT Golden Cross read -0.73, despite a 21.33% price rise — still far below the 2.2 “overbought” threshold.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) ticked up 1% to 14.41, affirming available liquidity to back further gains.\n\nBulls gear up for the next leg\n\nBitcoin’s price structure remains firm as whales accumulate and inflows shift toward strategic intent. The resistance at $87,500 may act as a final test before bulls reclaim higher ground.\n\nHowever, the lack of overheated indicators and strong institutional presence may give BTC the fuel it needs. Therefore, a breakout into the $90K–$100K range could soon become a reality if this momentum sustains."

            "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was grilled over dozens of messages he wrote decades ago before his company bought Instagram and WhatsApp.",
            "content": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nMark Zuckerberg's own emails, some of them more than 10 years old, revealed he had antitrust concerns long before the FTC brought its case against Meta.\n\nDuring 10 hours of testimony, a lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission grilled the Meta CEO over his old emails.\n\nZuckerberg's messages reveal near-nonstop concern about nascent rivals, blunt descriptions of some of Facebook's most pivotal deals.\n\n\"While we believe our current trajectory will yield strong business growth over the next 5 years, I worry it will also undermine our global network, erode our corporate brand, impose an increasingly large strategy tax on all of our work, and then over time we may face antitrust regulation requiring us to spin out other apps anyway,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a 2018 email to top Facebook executives.\n\nDaniel Matheson, the FTC's lead lawyer, highlighted another portion of Zuckerberg's prescient warning about his company's future.\n\n\"While most companies resist breakups, the corporate history is that most companies actually perform better after they've been split up,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"The synergies are usually less than people think and the strategy tax is usually greater than people think.\"\n\nWhen Matheson asked the billionaire to explain his thinking, Zuckerberg appeared flummoxed.\n\n\"I'm not sure exactly what I had in mind then,\" Zuckerberg said in response to Matheson's question about what corporate history he had in mind in 2018.\n\nThe trial, which began Monday and is expected to last up to eight weeks, had a high-profile start, with Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg as the prosecution's first witnesses.\n\nMatheson and his lawyers repeatedly turned to a 2012 message Zuckerberg sent Sandberg in which he bluntly summed up the need to acquire Instagram. In the same thread, he offered to teach Sandberg how to play Settlers of Catan.\n\n\"Messenger isn't beating WhatsApp,\" Zuckberg wrote. \"Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion and Groups and Places, although smaller efforts, have made only a little progress. That's not exactly killing it.\"\n\nFacebook acquired WhatsApp roughly two years later for $19 billion.\n\nIf the FTC wins the case, the government could ask Meta to sell Instagram and WhatsApp. Legal experts say the government faces a high bar in proving that Meta \"cemented\" its monopoly with its acquisitions of the two companies since the FTC already OKed those mergers years ago.\n\n(In October 2012, Facebook officially rebranded as Meta.)\n\nA courtroom sketch shows Mark Zuckerberg (right) while under questioning by an FTC lawyer during Meta's antitrust trial. REUTERS / DANA VERKOUTEREN\n\nThe many worries of Mark Zuckerberg\n\nMeta has sought to downplay Zuckerberg's messages. Mark Hansen, the company's lead lawyer, said that Facebook's cofounder had to be worried — it came with the job.\n\n\"Was it a constant joke at Meta that you were worrying and the sky was falling?\" Hansen asked Zuckerberg.\n\nZuckerberg replied that if it is a joke, \"It's probably behind my back,\" but stressed that worry is a cornerstone of Silicon Valley.\n\nHansen also said that while the government had numerous examples of Zuckerberg expressing fear about Instagram and WhatsApp's rise, there were also worries about defunct social networks like Path. In one email, Zuckerberg expressed worry that Dropbox could eventually become a competitor — that, too, never came to fruition.\n\n\"I'm getting a bit more worried about Path,\" Zuckerberg wrote in 2012 to top executives in a thread named \"Aquarium,\" the tongue-in-cheek name for one of the social network's real-life conference rooms at its Menlo Park HQ.\n\n\"Out of all the new social startups, they're the only one that goes right to the core of what we're trying to do around identity and friend sharing.\"\n\nProsecutors showed a 2012 email sent by Mark Zuckerberg about his worries surrounding Path, a then-growing social networking app. FTC/Business Insider\n\nZuckerberg's old worries are more relevant when they concern Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC contends that Facebook gobbled up the companies because it worried that, with a large user base, either one could eventually pivot to become more like Facebook.\n\n\"If Instagram continues to kick ass on mobile or if Google buys them, then over the next few years they could easily add pieces of their service that copy what we're doing now, and if they have a growing number of people's photos then that's a real issue for us,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a 2011 email.\n\nSometimes it's not about being Liked.\n\nAs for WhatsApp, the government showed multiple messages where Zuckerberg expressed concern about the messaging app that rose to popularity outside the US — and one where he seemed unmoved by its leadership.\n\n\"I found him fairly impressive although disappointingly (or maybe positive for us) unambitious,\" Zuckerberg wrote in 2012 to colleagues after he met Jan Koum, the cofounder of WhatsApp.\n\nThe Meta CEO seemed taken aback when Hansen asked Zuckerberg about the email. Zuckerberg said the point of his message was that he had learned Koum did not want to pivot or monetize WhatsApp in a way that would truly unnerve Facebook.\n\nIn contrast, the FTC showed multiple messages in which Zuckerberg expressed frustration with Facebook's efforts to develop a competing camera app as Instagram skyrocketed in popularity.\n\n\"What is going in with our photos team?\" Zuckerberg wrote in a 2011 message that was partially redacted when it was presented in court. \"Between [redacted] leaving and [redacted] being checked out/a bad manager as well as [redacted] also being checked out and [redacted] not wanting to work with this team because he thinks this team sucks. It seems like we have a really critical situation to fix here.\""

            "description": "The cases against Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon could profoundly shape the future of global technology.",
            "content": "Tech giant Google has just suffered another legal blow in the United States, losing a landmark antitrust case. This follows on from the company’s loss in a similar case last year.\n\nSocial media giant Meta is also currently embroiled in a landmark legal battle in the US that could change not only how it operates, but how millions of people around the world communicate.\n\nHearings in the Meta case commenced earlier this week in a court in Washington DC, after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg failed to settle the case for US$450 million. Brought by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the suit alleges Meta broke antitrust laws and illegally secured a monopoly over social media platforms.\n\nAlong with Google and Meta, Amazon and Apple are also currently facing significant antitrust challenges in the US.\n\nAll of these actions are continuing despite major changes in both the FTC and the US Department of Justice as a result of the election of Donald Trump.\n\nCollectively, these cases represent a substantial regulatory push to examine and potentially curb the market power of big tech. So what are all of these cases about exactly? What are the next steps in each of them? And what might they mean for consumers?\n\nThe cases against Google\n\nThe case Google just lost was related to online advertising.\n\nThe US Department of Justice alleged Google had behaved anticompetitively to monopolise the complex digital advertising technology market. This market facilitates the buying and selling of online ads.\n\nThe US district judge, Leonie Brinkema, agreed Google has a monopoly over the tools used by online publishers to host ad space, and the software that facilitates transactions between online publishers and advertisers.\n\nIn her ruling, Judge Brinkema said Google had “wilfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts” which ultimately resulted in it obtaining “monopoly power in the open-web display publisher ad server market”.\n\nGoogle has said it will appeal the decision. The Department of Justice will ask the court to require Google to divest parts of its ad tech business when the remedies phase of this trial starts later this month.\n\nThe second case involving Google is related to internet search.\n\nThe Department of Justice argued Google used exclusionary agreements, such as paying Apple billions annually to be the default search engine on iPhones, to lock out competitors.\n\nIn August 2024, a federal judge ruled Google acted illegally to maintain its search monopoly.\n\nThe case has now moved to the remedies phase. A crucial remedies trial is scheduled to begin next week. During this, the court will hear arguments on what actions should be taken against Google. Potential remedies could be significant, with regulators previously suggesting measures such as restrictions on Google’s Android operating system or even forcing the sale of its Chrome browser.\n\nGoogle has stated its intention to appeal this ruling as well.\n\nThe case against Meta\n\nThe FTC’s case against Meta alleges the tech giant illegally maintained a monopoly in the market for “personal social networking services”.\n\nThe core of the FTC’s argument is that Meta employed a “buy-or-bury” strategy to eliminate competitive threats.\n\nThis allegedly involved acquiring nascent rivals, most notably Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, specifically to neutralise them before they could challenge Facebook’s dominance.\n\nThe FTC points to internal communications as evidence of anticompetitive intent. These include Mark Zuckerberg’s statement, “It is better to buy than compete”. They also include an internal memo which showed Zuckerberg considered spinning off Instagram in 2018 over concerns about antitrust scrutiny.\n\nThe commission argues Meta’s actions stifled innovation and harmed consumers by limiting choices. It’s seeking to force Meta to divest, or sell off, both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nMeta vigorously defends its actions. It argues it does not hold a monopoly, facing fierce competition from platforms such as TikTok, YouTube and X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThe company contends the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were pro-competitive, allowing Meta to invest billions to improve and scale the apps, ultimately benefiting users. A key defence point is that the FTC itself reviewed and approved both deals over a decade ago.\n\nThe trial is expected to last eight weeks.\n\nWill Oliver/EPA\n\nThe cases against Apple and Amazon\n\nIn March 2024, the Department of Justice, along with several states, sued Apple, alleging it illegally maintains a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Apple uses its control over the iPhone ecosystem to stifle competition and innovation by, for example, degrading messaging quality between iPhones and Android devices and limiting the functionality of third-party digital wallets and smartwatches.\n\nApple filed a motion to dismiss the case in August 2024. The litigation is in its early stages and is expected to continue for several years.\n\nIn September 2023, the FTC, joined by numerous states, also sued Amazon.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the tech giant unlawfully maintains monopoly power in both the market for “online superstores” (where consumers shop) and “online marketplace services” (for third-party sellers).\n\nThe FTC claims Amazon uses interlocking anticompetitive tactics. These include punishing sellers for offering lower prices elsewhere, coercing sellers into using its services, degrading search results with excessive ads, and charging exorbitant seller fees.\n\nIn late 2024, the presiding judge largely denied Amazon’s attempt to dismiss the core federal claims, allowing the case to proceed.\n\nA trial is currently scheduled for October 2026.\n\nChip Somodevilla/POOL/EPA\n\nMajor structural changes could come\n\nTaken together, these lawsuits represent the most significant antitrust enforcement push against major technology firms in the US in decades. They signal a fundamental re-examination of how competition laws apply to fast-evolving digital platforms and ecosystems.\n\nThe outcomes could potentially lead to major structural changes. These changes could include the forced breakup of companies such as Meta, or significant behavioural remedies restricting how these firms operate.\n\nRegardless of the specific results, the decisions in these cases will likely set crucial legal precedents. In turn, these will profoundly shape the future competitive landscape for technology. They will also likely influence regulation globally, and impact innovation and investment across the digital economy.\n\nWhat the cases do not reflect is the change in independence of regulatory bodies in the US, where consistency with White House policy is now paramount. The outcomes will surely test the relationship between Trump and the “tech bros” who’ve, quite literally, been at his side recently."

            "description": "Economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the United States.",
            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar.\n\nCurrencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S.\n\nThe dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged.\n\nREAD MORE: What is the bond market, and why does it matter for the economy?\n\n“Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.”\n\nSince mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9 percent against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years.\n\nMany investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost.\n\nWith much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living.\n\nDollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others.\n\nNow that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk.\n\nDollar drop is odd\n\n“The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.”\n\nTraditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products.\n\nBut the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5 percent against the euro and pound, and 6 percent against the yen since early April.\n\nAs any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too.\n\nAnd any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk.\n\nFederal debt troubles\n\nMore worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120 percent of U.S. annual economic output.\n\n“Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ”\n\nThey already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival.\n\nChina has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort.\n\nAnother possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies.\n\nSaid BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.”\n\nNot everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S.\n\nSteve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand.\n\n“The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.”\n\nErratic policy spooks investors\n\nMaybe so, but Trump is testing the limits.\n\nIt’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money.\n\nThere are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!”\n\nEconomists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled.\n\nBerkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful.\n\n“This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.”"

            "content": "This is part of Egg, an attempt to explain why Americans have absolutely lost their minds over egg prices.\n\nYou are probably familiar with the story going around about the egg shortage: The United States is in the midst of an outbreak of the highly contagious avian flu. Millions of hens across the country have been wiped out, greatly curtailing the number of eggs in the supply chain. That’s what led to the $12 cartons, totally barren egg sections at the grocery store, surcharges applied to the omelets at Waffle House, and—if we’re being honest—the reelection of Donald Trump under a storm of consumer outrage.\n\nThat all makes sense on one level, but Angela Huffman, head of Farm Action—a nonprofit that campaigns against the corporatization of the food system—believes there’s something fishier going on. Maybe, she said, the avian flu is an easy scapegoat for what’s really happening. Maybe the nation’s largest egg producers are using this opportunity to turn a fortune off of breakfast. So Huffman, and her organization, started investigating.\n\n“We had noticed that egg prices had gone up, but at the same time, the largest producers had their profits going up drastically,” Huffman told me. “We thought, OK, if they just needed to raise prices to account for the losses of their hens due to the flu, why are they making five times more money?’ That was really odd to us.”\n\nAccording to Farm Action’s research, there is evidence that the avian flu’s impact on egg production hasn’t been quite as pervasive as consumers might think. Despite the wipeout infestations and mass euthanizing, Farm Action alleges the size of egg-laying flocks in 2025 are, on average, only about 5 percent smaller, on a month-to-month basis, than they were in 2021. (Other reports put that number closer to 10 percent.) This is especially true for Cal-Maine Foods, the agribusiness giant responsible for 20 percent of the American egg supply. Huffman alleges that Cal-Maine has continued to churn out the same 1.1 billion eggs, year after year, despite the flu. Yet Cal-Maine’s revenue has skyrocketed. Per a report in the Guardian, the company’s profits tripled this quarter compared to the same time frame last year, and in total, its margins have grown nearly 800 percent since the winter of 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Put another way, Cal-Maine has made more in a single quarter than they made in an entire year prior to the 2022 avian flu outbreak,” the group said. In fact, they made so much that the company is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice for alleged price fixing, resulting in a 4 percent drop in its stock. “Egg producers and grocery stores may leverage the current avian flu outbreak as an opportunity to further constrain supply or hike up egg prices to increase profits,” a group of Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, wrote in an open letter in January, according to the New York Times. A 2011 lawsuit alleging price fixing by some of the same egg producers resulted in a jury finding against the producers in 2023.\n\nThe company didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment, but according to the Guardian’s investigation, Cal-Maine’s financial documents maintain that its production lines have negligible effect on consumer expenses. (“We do not sell eggs directly to consumers or set the prices at which eggs are sold to consumers,” it said.) There might be some truth to that: As David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University, told me, egg producers generally set their prices based on the research conducted by various analytics firms that evaluate the supply and demand in the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of those analytics companies is Urner Barry, which has run into controversy over its pricing apparatus in the past. Case in point: In 2020, the state of New York referenced Urner Barry in a lawsuit focused on price fixing during the pandemic, alleging that wholesale producers “use Urner Barry’s indexed prices as justification to set their own prices for the sale of eggs,” no matter how expensive they might be. (A spokesperson at Urner Barry has pushed back against those claims, telling the Guardian, in part, that “buyers and sellers are always free to transact at different prices.” “We do not set prices. We simply observe and report what is happening ,” the company told me. “There is pretty universal consensus that the recent sharp rise in prices is primarily down to bird flu.”)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his part, Ortega thinks Cal-Maine may have gotten lucky and is enjoying a windfall. “It’s not surprising to me that Cal-Maine is reporting record profits, because even when prices rise, people still buy eggs,” he said. “The company’s facilities house a lot of birds. And if you haven’t been hit with an outbreak, while you’re still facing some costs with biosecurity and things like that, you could benefit from those higher prices. That doesn’t just apply to Cal-Maine, that applies to any supplier in the business.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJadrian Wooten, another food economist who teaches at Virginia Tech, added, “The very easy answer here is that during a shortage, if Cal-Maine doesn’t increase the price of their eggs, they’re going to have very cheap eggs, and people are going to buy way too many of those eggs. All of a sudden it will be harder for anyone to get eggs. Higher prices help allocate scarce resources.”\n\n“It’s a symptom of a larger issue: the consolidation of our food sector into just a few hands,” Huffman told me. “These companies have a history of using any sort of supply chain disruption to price gouge consumers.”\n\nUnfortunately for us, this is unlikely to change anytime soon. Eggs are what’s known as “inelastic” products, meaning that rising prices don’t necessarily decrease consumption. As the Food & Water Watch report points out, 97 percent of U.S. households buy eggs, and have continued to do so in spite of prices that are often twice as high. Whether these price hikes come from normal market fluctuations or something more untoward, there’s little incentive for companies to stop that gravy train."

            "description": "The Trump administration and DOGE tried to cut more than 1,400 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. An employee union and other groups are fighting to keep the regulator intact.",
            "content": "Over 1,400 employees who were about to be laid off from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will be able to keep working for at least another week after a federal judge intervened in the dismantling of the independent regulator on Friday.\n\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, DC, said the Trump administration could not move forward with the layoffs, which hit roughly 90 percent of the agency, until it presents more evidence about how the terminations have been carried out. The employees learned on Thursday that they were going to lose access to agency systems the following evening and their final date of employment would be June 16. Now, a hearing on the matter is scheduled for April 28. Jackson had previously issued a ruling slowing the firings of probationary employees at the CFPB in February.\n\nSince its establishment by Congress in 2010, the CFPB has helped consumers fight banks and other companies over dubious fees, racial discrimination in lending, and a number of scams. But some conservatives have called for the agency to be dismantled to limit the regulation of businesses, and some companies, including tech giants, have questioned its expanding oversight. This week, an agency official told staff that cases on medical debt, student loans, consumer data, and digital payments would be de-prioritized.\n\nGroups including the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents part of the CFPB workforce, sued the Trump administration in February in an effort to preserve the agency after its acting director, Russell Vought, sought to lay off workers and bring some projects to a stop. That prompted judge Jackson’s initial ruling calling for a pause on the initial cuts until the Trump administration provided more information. Part of her ruling was overturned by an appellate court, and the Trump administration also could appeal her order from Friday blocking the widespread layoffs.\n\nFor the time being, two current CFPB employees say they are continuing to work on their cases, including ongoing litigation.\n\nIn a court filing to Jackson on Friday, an anonymous employee said Gavin Kliger, a member of Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, managed the disputed layoffs of nearly 1,500 workers. “He kept the team up for 36 hours straight to ensure that the notices would go out yesterday (April 17),” the anonymous worker wrote. “Gavin was screaming at people he did not believe were working fast enough to ensure they could go out on this compressed timeline, calling them incompetent.”\n\nMark Paoletta, the agency’s chief legal officer, wrote in a separate filing on Friday that he and two other CFPB attorneys assessed “line by line” how to “right-size” the bureau. They determined that about 207 employees would be sufficient to carry out duties required by law, according to the filing, which justified laying off the rest of the agency’s roughly 1,700 employees.\n\n“Leadership has discovered many instances in which the Bureau’s activities have pushed well beyond the limits of the law,” Paoletta wrote, citing cases pursued “without the slightest evidence of intentional discrimination” and “into new areas beyond its jurisdiction such as peer-to-peer lending, rent-to-own, and discrimination as unfair practice.”"

            "content": "How FDA cuts could make the food and drug supply less safe\n\ntoggle caption Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWhen Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in March that he would eliminate thousands of jobs from federal health agencies, he promised that he would spare the inspectors who keep America's food and drugs safe by scrutinizing factories around the world.\n\nKennedy kept his word and didn't fire inspectors, but key support staffers who handled travel arrangements, reimbursements and more are gone, according to two current inspectors who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to the media.\n\nSome of the support staffers were asked to come back temporarily. But last week, they were told to go home again, the current inspectors said.\n\nThat loss of support could make it much harder to inspect factories producing things like baby formula, eye drops, cinnamon and a range of generic drugs, all of which have had manufacturing problems that led to recalls in recent years. In some cases, people were injured or died.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"That is America's first line of defense for the safety of their food and their drugs,\" said a current pharmaceutical inspector.\n\nIn response to questions from NPR, HHS said in a statement: \"The FDA is monitoring inspectional travel and ensuring necessary support is in place to continue these functions.\"\n\nShift of trip planning slows down inspections\n\nBut some inspectors are canceling their trips because of the staff cuts. A food and animal feed inspector who wasn't authorized to speak publicly told NPR they're still waiting to be reimbursed for thousands of dollars in recent inspection-related travel expenses. \"I don't trust the process,\" the inspector said.\n\nFDA staffers received an email on April 7 telling them they would be responsible for their own travel arrangements from now on, offering office hours for people who need help. Inspectors say it's not that simple.\n\n\"International travel is extremely complicated,\" said the food and feed inspector. \"Some countries require visas, others don't. The coordinators maintained a master list and helped process visa paperwork. While I was doing inspections, they kept everything moving behind the scenes.\"\n\nA March 11 email to FDA staff says the administration lowered government employee credit card limits to $1. Now to book travel, inspectors need prior approval to get the credit limit raised. The drug inspector said the administrator they had emailed for authorization had been laid off. \"It's hard to believe the work is actually going to get done,\" the inspector said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nInspections were already falling short of goals\n\nThe reduced support for inspectors could exacerbate long-standing problems.\n\nAccording to a recent Government Accountability Office report, staffing problems caused the FDA to conduct fewer drug inspections in 2023 than it did before the COVID-19 pandemic, when such inspections were paused. \"Since resuming inspections, FDA has struggled to retain staff,\" the report said. \"From Nov. 2021 to June 2024, the vacancy rate among investigators who inspect foreign and domestic manufacturers jumped from 9% to 16% — leading to fewer inspections.\" Concerns about pay and work-life balance contributed to turnover, the report said.\n\nThe agency also hasn't met its goals for foreign or domestic food inspections since 2018, according to another GAO report.\n\nPeter Baker, who spent 10 years as an FDA drug inspector before leaving in 2019, said not being able to inspect facilities especially in countries like China and India is a \"really big deal.\"\n\n\"It matters a lot because most of our generic products are made in areas of the world that are semi-regulated or unregulated,\" said Baker, who now runs a consulting firm called Live Oak Quality Assurance. \"So the only outside eyes that are going to look at the quality system that is backing these drugs that these patients are eventually going to take is the FDA investigator. They may be the only person with an independent lens who's going to look at the conditions under which these products are manufactured.\"\n\nFor instance, during a two-week inspection of a drug factory in India that ended last September, FDA inspectors observed inadequate cleaning of equipment, problems with air handling systems (including bird droppings and feathers on air purification units) and 15 waste bags containing torn quality records, according to an agency warning letter made public in March. The company, Granules India Limited, did not respond to NPR's request for comment.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nInternational trips take extra support\n\nThe laid-off support staffers used to handle air travel, hotels and ground transportation — all for inspectors' trips around the world. \"This was a full-time job for someone for a reason — it's a ton of work,\" the food and feed inspector said.\n\n\"It appears that this is going to slow down the ability of inspectors to get their work done,\" said Baker. \"The quality of inspections is inevitably going to go down, which is a sad situation for public health. And I think overall, the patients that are most vulnerable, which is generally young children and older people, are going to bear the consequences of this.\"\n\nInternational inspection trips typically last three weeks, involve multiple facilities and cost more than $10,000, the current inspectors and Baker told NPR. Sometimes, that's the cost of the airfare alone.\n\nEntire trips go on government credit cards in the inspectors' names. If the government doesn't reimburse them promptly, the inspectors worry about having to pay the steep bills themselves.\n\n\"It's very stressful,\" said Baker. \"They're probably going to have to take out loans from family members or maybe even from a bank to be able to fulfill their obligations on those credit cards if those expense report payments are delayed.\"\n\nThe uncertainty is a problem because the FDA was already short-staffed and has trouble attracting and keeping people who can make more money in the private sector.\n\nChris Middendorf, who spent most of his more than two decades at the FDA as an inspector, said if inspectors now need to spend at least a week handling trip logistics themselves, that's time they can't be writing up previous inspection reports, learning about new technologies and preparing for their next inspection. \"So it's all just going to slow down the inspection process.\"\n\nMiddendorf, who is now senior director of pharmaceutical and biotech compliance at the law firm Hogan Lovells, said in-person inspections remain the gold standard for assuring quality. When it comes to drugs, the biggest risk factor in contamination is human error.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"What you don't want to see are basically operators touching [their faces], messing around with their mask by touching things with their hands they shouldn't be,\" he said, explaining that these errors can cause bacteria to get into sterile products. \"But the only way you can see them is by standing outside the production window and watching for hours.\""

Its tagline, \"Shop like a billionaire,\" is inextricably linked to the affordability of items on its platform. And although Shein—which vows to make global fashion \"accessible to all\" by selling inexpensive stylish clothing—moved its headquarters from China to Singapore in 2022, most of its products are still controversially manufactured in China, the BBC reported.\n\nFor weeks, the US-China trade war has seen both sides spiking tariffs. In the US, the White House last night crunched the numbers and confirmed that China now faces tariffs of up to 245 percent, The Wall Street Journal reported. That figure includes new tariffs Trump has imposed, taxing all Chinese goods by 145 percent, as well as prior 100 percent tariffs lobbed by the Biden administration that are still in effect on EVs and Chinese syringes.\n\nLast week, China announced that it would stop retaliations, CNBC reported. But that came after China rolled out 125 percent tariffs on US goods. While China has since accused Trump of weaponizing tariffs to \"an irrational level,\" other retaliations have included increasingly cutting off US access to critical minerals used in tech manufacturing and launching antitrust probes into US companies.\n\nFor global retailers, the tit-for-tat tariffs have immediately scrambled business plans. Particularly for Temu and Shein, Trump's decision to end the “de minimis” exemption on May 2—which allowed shipments valued under $800 to be imported duty-free—will soon hit hard, exposing them to 90 percent tariffs that inevitably led to next week's price shifts. According to The Guardian, starting on June 1, retailers will have to pay $150 tariffs on each individual package."

And deciding not to purchase a new car won't fully insulate drivers from price changes, either.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat's because tariffs are pushing up the prices of parts — so the cost of maintenance and repairs are also poised to rise. And when repairing cars gets more expensive, so does something else: auto insurance.\n\n\"These tariffs are going to affect everybody who owns and operates a car,\" says Jessica Caldwell, the head of insights at the automotive data company Edmunds.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs will rise\n\nRight now, there's a 25% tariff on imported new cars . There's also a plan to impose a 25% tariff on at least some imported car parts, although the details aren't finalized yet and that is not yet in effect. (Changes to one or both of those tariffs may be what Trump had in mind when he told reporters on April 14 that he was \"looking at something to help some of the car companies.\")\n\nBut other tariffs are also affecting car parts, including tariffs on steel and aluminum , and a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, as well as a 25% tariff on goods imported from Canada and Mexico that don't meet the requirements of the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) trade deal.\n\nLaurent Spence works at a NAPA auto parts shop in Desert Hot Springs, Calif., and rattles off some of the high-turnover products that are already being affected by tariffs. Brake pads from Mexico. Brake rotors from China. Suspension parts from Turkey and Thailand. Tools from Taiwan.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSpence says he used to update about 20 prices a week on the store shelves, many of those markdowns for sales. Now, he says, he's swapping out prices \"every day\" — and most of them are trending up.\n\nSeeing the trend, Spence has taken advantage of his employee discount and started to stock up on parts for his own vehicles, which are older and need a lot of work. \"Belts, ball joints, control arms,\" he says. \"I'm just kind of stockpiling on nearly everything that I will need in the future as a just-in-case.\" (He bought up coffee beans, too.)\n\nWhether you do your own work or take your car to a shop, when the price of parts goes up, it makes basic maintenance and any needed repairs more expensive .\n\nMagnify this hundreds of thousands of times, and that's the situation for auto insurers. If every single repair becomes more expensive, so does their overall cost of doing business.\n\nInsurance premiums will eventually be pushed up\n\nIf insurers have to pay more for repairs, they're going to charge more in premiums.\n\nInsurance is, fundamentally, a way of spreading costs out among a big pool of people. As a result, even if you aren't personally in a crash, your premiums will go up to reflect the higher cost of replacing bumpers and doing bodywork.\n\nThat's true even if you have the bare minimum insurance, says Shannon Martin, an insurance expert at Bankrate.\n\n\"If you're someone with an older car and liability-only coverage, you might think, 'Well, my rate's going to stay the same.' But it won't,\" she says. \"You have property damage coverage on your policy that pays for someone else's vehicle … that is now going to cost more to fix.\"\n\nInsurance rates are already painfully high for many customers, averaging more than $2,600 annually for full coverage, according to Bankrate. Rates rose sharply after the pandemic caused supply chain disruptions in vehicle and parts production. Lower supply meant higher prices. After a year or two, insurance premiums soared, with year-over-year increases topping 20%.\n\nThose rate hikes were finally settling down. According to the latest Consumer Price Index data, released last week, insurance prices actually dropped slightly between February and March, and annual increases were back in pre-pandemic territory.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut the introduction of tariffs, Martin says, \"really kind of throws a monkey wrench into everything.\"\n\nDelays and uncertainty — and some evergreen advice\n\nDrivers shouldn't expect to see their premiums go up overnight. Insurance rates, as a rule, can't change as quickly as other prices do.\n\nCompanies need to assess their higher costs, and then negotiate with the state regulators who try to protect ratepayers from unreasonable hikes. Even after hikes get approved, your current rates are locked in until your policy renews.\n\nAnd then there's the caveat that the tariffs keep changing, with new additions and exemptions and reprieves.\n\nThat's complicating one of President Trump's stated goals for these tariffs, which is encouraging manufacturers to move to the United States. Companies say it's tricky to make plans for relocations when the rules keep changing.\n\nIt also makes it next to impossible to accurately forecast how much something like, say, auto insurance rates, will rise.\n\n\"Any numbers that people give you are just guesses that can change at any moment,\" says Martin, \"because everything's so unpredictable right now.\"\n\nIn these unpredictable times, some age-old advice is still reliable.\n\nSpence recommends having a trusted mechanic. Caldwell reminds drivers to shop around for their best rates. And Martin says the uncertainty about insurance rates is yet another good reason to be careful on the road. A good driving record will help keep your insurance rates low. Unlike tariffs, driving cautiously is something you can control."

But that is about the only thing that is clear.\n\nFor the moment, his administration has opened a formal investigation that would determine the extent to which importing these products represents a national security risk — and then decide the scope of the tariffs and how they will be applied. Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical industry, investors, and consumers are left wondering what to expect — and how much more the tariffs may cost them.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThere are various possibilities to unpack, such as the origins of active pharmaceutical ingredients and the types of medicines more likely to rise in price than others. There are also the maneuvers drug companies can make — from pricing strategies to moving production around — in order to mitigate the impact and there is the extent to which some drugs, namely generics, may remain available."

            "content": "Comment The splintering of the global system for identifying and tracking security bugs in technology products has begun.\n\nEarlier this week, the widely used Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program faced doom as the US government discontinued funding for MITRE, the non-profit that operates the program. Uncle Sam U-turned at the very last minute, and promised another 11 months of cash to keep the program going.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU is rolling its own.\n\nThe European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) developed and maintains this alternative, which is known as the EUVD, or the European Union Vulnerability Database. The EU mandated its creation under the Network and Information Security 2 Directive, and ENISA announced it last June.\n\nThe EUVD is similar to the US government's NVD, or National Vulnerability Database, in that it organizes disclosed bugs by their CVE-assigned unique ID, documents their impact, and links to advisories and patches.\n\nInterestingly, the Euro database also uses its own EUVD IDs to track security bugs as well as CVE-managed identifiers and GSD IDs, the latter of which are issued by the (what appears to be now-defunct) Global Security Database operated by the Cloud Security Alliance.\n\nAlthough the EUVD has been gestating for nearly a year, the uncertainty around the CVE program is set to push the European effort into the spotlight as a replacement, fallback, or alternative for CVE. ENISA is, we note, a partner of CVE; specifically, it's a CVE numbering authority.\n\nThe EUVD \"will hopefully gain more traction so that Europe can achieve self-sustainability in this domain as well,\" Marcus Söderblom, an infosec consultant at IT services giant Atea said this week.\n\nBen Radcliff, senior director of cyber operations at infosec services provider Optiv, told The Register Thursday that the CVE funding fiasco revealed a serious flaw: Dependence on the largesse of a single, and now volatile, government.\n\n\"Continued dependency on funding from CISA might put pressure on the organization to act and operate with less impartiality and political agnosticism,\" he added. \"One of the key promises of EUVD is that it will be multi-nationally sponsored, ostensibly avoiding that pitfall.\"\n\nOr, it could present another pitfall: Separate bug tracking systems for the US and Europe. Like imperial versus metric, only worse.\n\n\"While it's likely that there will be coordination between the US NVD and the EUVD such that records available in one database mirror those in the other, I do expect that regional regulatory governance will tend to favor one vulnerability database over another,\" Tim Mackey, head of software supply chain risk strategy at app security firm Black Duck, told The Register.\n\nThe timing of the EU database's emergence \"cannot be ignored as a coincidence,\" Flashpoint vulnerability analyst Brian Martin said on a Thursday webinar. \"To me, it signals a global lack of trust in the US government's commitment to ensuring the continuity of CVE.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another \"global\" system for identifying and numbering security flaws, the Global CVE Allocation System or GCVE, sprang from CVE's almost-ashes. \"But that essentially looks like it's one person on a GitHub project,\" Martin said.\n\nIn addition to these two, there's also the new CVE Foundation, a non-profit formed to bring the CVE program under its auspices and eliminate a \"single point of failure in the vulnerability management ecosystem.\"\n\nAnd, of course, MITRE will continue operating the CVE program per usual under its contract with the Feds — at least for the next 11 months.\n\n\"There's no understanding or guarantee about what will happen after that point,\" Flashpoint vulnerability analyst Kecia Hoyt said on the webinar. \"Maybe we can go enjoy our weekend at this point, but I don't want to be here having this conversation a year from now, and nothing's changed.\"\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nHaving a standardized system for identifying vulnerabilities is extremely important, and helps keep everyone — companies, vulnerability researchers, developers, governments — on the same page. If someone says CVE-2017-5754, for example, there's no question they are talking about Intel's Meltdown, which did also show up in a handful of Arm CPU cores.\n\nThis common language helps avoid what we currently have with cybercrime-groups, where various government agencies and private-sector threat intel firms all have their own naming conventions — is it Cozy Bear, Midnight Blizzard, or APT 29? And how loosely linked are Salt Typhoon, Famous Sparrow, and Earth Estries?\n\n\"I say Scattered Spider, you say Oktapus,\" Hoyt said, referring to two names for the collective of what's suspected to be young US and UK criminals known for their ransomware heists of Las Vegas casinos.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of different terminology thrown around, and are we talking about the same thing? Does this report equal that report? That's really what CVE and did for the vulnerability space,\" she added.\n\nSo now the question becomes: Will someone, a government, or a collective industry group, step in and provide a more permanent, universal system? Or will the entire vulnerability management system break off into a million pieces with companies, governments, and community-based orgs all naming and tracking vulnerabilities independently of each other. And if that's the case: Who to trust?\n\n\"Having an independent government solution for this vulnerability catalog, versus a larger corporate or global organization, might seem like a good idea,\" Hoyt said, but added that \"the former creates that single point of failure we're all experiencing.\"\n\nHowever, putting a large company or even a coalition of tech giants in charge means \"the possibility of bias and jeopardizing neutrality,\" she noted. ®"

The People's Union USA, the grassroots organization coordinating the spending boycotts, is urging people to spend money only on essential purchases, and to do so at small, local businesses with cash rather than a credit or debit card. Other upcoming, retailer-specific boycotts take aim at corporate greed in general or at companies that have ditched their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, organizers say. Those include Amazon and Walmart boycotts in May, Target and McDonald's in June.\n\nIn an extensive piece on the consumer boycotts, USA Today notes that while organizers say the pressure is having an effect, analysis of the impact is mixed. \"I still believe economic resistance—us withholding our money—targeting specific corporations, is our greatest weapon,\" says John Schwarz of the People's Union. \"And now with things that are going on financially and economically, families should be partaking in economic resistance just to save a little money for themselves right now for what's coming.\" Coinciding with the three-day economic blackout is another national day of action planned for Saturday. Protests are planned in hundreds of cities, but some groups are opting to hold other types of events including food drives and nature cleanups, Axios reports. (More protests stories.)"

            "content": "It's no secret that Musk is anxious about the world's population. In 2022, he made the controversial proclamation that \"population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming.\"\n\nThat wasn't just one of his many idle thoughts, but a serious mantra to live by. The centi-billionaire now has at least 14 children with at least four different women — Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis, author Justin Wilson, musician Claire \"Grimes\" Boucher, and right-wing influencer Ashley St. Clair — and those are just the ones we know about.\n\nIt's all part of his sci-fi addled worldview, where humanity is somehow at risk of extinction unless he can sire an army of kids and waste tens of billions of dollars trying to get to Mars — instead of doing something concretely useful like ending homelessness, an issue he's called \"propaganda.\"\n\nElon Musk: It’s not just about visiting Mars. It’s about building a city on Mars. \"I would like to go to Mars, that's nice to have, but what is important is that we establish a self-sustaining city on Mars. This is important for the long-term future of humanity or consciousness… pic.twitter.com/TJ8sEvbbUG — ELON CLIPS (@ElonClipsX) September 24, 2024\n\nIn 2024, the world's richest man bought a $35 million compound to house his \"legion\" — his eyebrow-raising word for his children — and their mothers, so that his kids could \"be a part of one another's lives.\" Musk has likewise explored ways to fill the compound as fast as possible, telling a then-pregnant St. Clair that \"to reach legion-level before the apocalypse, we will need to use surrogates.\"\n\nAs Musk's profile rises to simply un-ignorable levels thanks to his reckless work dismantling the US government, so too have the billionaire's efforts to keep his growing brood a secret from prying eyes. Unfortunately for Musk — or, more accurately, his kids — he's just not very good at it.\n\nDamning reporting by the Wall Street Journal this week has uncovered the ways Musk tries to keep his harem under wraps. Not surprisingly, it has a lot to do with money, veiled threats, and sinister innuendo intended to silence the many mothers of his children.\n\nWorking through a personal fixer named Jared Birchall, Musk deploys nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) and payment contracts designed to keep the mothers of his children quiet under threat of legal action.\n\nSt. Clair, for example, told the WSJ she was offered $15 million on top of $100,000 a month for her silence about Musk's child. Months after their child was born, Musk began ghosting St. Clair, prompting her to file for sole custody of the infant. Musk then immediately retaliated by substantially reducing his child support payment while refusing a paternity test, St. Clair's lawyer told People.\n\nPer the WSJ, St. Clair told Birchall \"I don’t want my son to feel like he’s a secret.\" The fixer's response? That going the \"legal route\" with Musk \"aways, always leads to a worse outcome for that woman than what it would have been otherwise.\"\n\n\"Privacy and confidentiality is the top of the list in every aspect of his life,\" Birchall told St. Clair at the time.\n\nEven the women who reject Musk's uncomfortable advances are subject to strict privacy rules. Tiffany Fong, for example, is a cryptocurrency influencer whom Musk privately messaged back in 2024, asking if she was interested in having his kid.

            "content": "Lady Gaga had no problem maneuvering through mic issues that plagued the beginning of her “Mayhem” in the desert showcase for Coachella weekend two. The singer’s head mic started glitching and cut off during “Abracadabra,” the second song of her headlining set on Friday night.\n\nHowever, before descending towards center stage, Gaga slyly exchanged the broken equipment for a regular handheld mic. She continued through her choreography without missing a beat — holding the mic in one hand and a cane in the other. It took less than a few minutes for Gaga to emerge with a new head mic that went without issue for the remainder of the night.\n\nGaga later apologized for the malfunction while at the piano, telling festival-goers, “I’m sorry my mic was broken for a second… at least you know sing live.” She continued, “I guess all we can do is our best and I’m certainly giving you my best tonight.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn a review, Variety‘s Chris Willman wrote of the weekend one performance, “The biggest difference between Gaga and some of the other performers at Coachella almost goes without saying: live singing.\n\nBetween the Go-Go’s wonderfully raw performance earlier in the day and Lady Gaga’s set, you could catch a lot of Memorex performances, switching YouTube channels in search of somebody putting a real voice on the line. You could pretty much anticipate that Gaga would not be miming (or at least not often), but it was still a pleasure to hear her lightly panting into the mic now and again, as if we needed proof she was delivering the goods al fresco.”\n\nCreative directed in part with choreographer Parris Goebel, Gaga’s Coachella weekend two performance remained largely the same as weekend one. She will bring “Mayhem” on the road later this year with tour dates across North America, Europe and the U.K. set to kick off in July. This lineup also includes shows in Mexico, Brazil and Singapore."

            "content": "ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — From Harry Potter to Super Mario Bros. to Frankenstein’s monster, Universal Orlando Resort is pulling out all the pop culture stops at its newest and largest theme park in Florida.\n\nWith five distinctively-themed sections and a 500-room hotel, the multibillion-dollar Universal Epic Universe is slated to open to the public on May 22, just in time for the start of summer, when the Orlando area’s theme parks are usually jammed with families and young park-goers fresh out of school.\n\nIt’s the first major, traditional theme park to open in Florida since 1999, when Universal Islands of Adventure debuted, though Universal opened a themed Orlando water park, Volcano Bay, in 2017. The addition of Epic Universe brings the total number of parks at the Florida resort to four, including Universal Studios.\n\nThe opening also raises the stakes in Universal’s competition with crosstown rival Walt Disney World for a greater share of Orlando’s annual influx of 74 million tourists.\n\nUniversal officials also describe Epic Universe as the company’s most technologically advanced theme park. For example, it uses a facial recognition system for ride express lines.\n\nUniversal’s owner, Comcast NBCUniversal, also announced plans this month for its first Universal-branded theme park and resort in Europe, at a location north of London. A year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas should open later this year and a family-oriented theme park is slated to open next year in a Dallas suburb.\n\nEpic Universe is making its big bang, with single-day tickets starting at $139 for adults and increasing to $199 during peak periods, just as the Trump administration stirs up economic uncertainty.\n\nU.S. tariff announcements threaten to limit the desire of some Americans to spend on vacations. And the rough treatment that some U.S. visitors have experienced on arrival, as well as a boycott of the United States by some Canadians, are raising fears that international tourists will stay away.\n\nTax receipts show Orlando’s tourist economy was booming last year, with Orange County collecting a record $359 million in tourist taxes.\n\nHere’s a look at Epic Universe’s different sections.\n\nCelestial Park\n\nCelestial Park is the hub in the spoke-like design of Epic Universe, connecting the other “worlds.”\n\nThe astronomically-themed section is the only one with original characters not based on pre-existing intellectual property. Centered around a football field-sized water fountain and filled with abundant, colorful flowers, it’s an oasis of calm between the sensory overload of the four sections.\n\nThat’s not to say excitement can’t be found in Celestial Park, which is home to a 133-foot (40.5-meter) high dual launching roller coaster, Stardust Racers, and an enormous carousel.\n\nSuper Nintendo World\n\nSuper Nintendo World is the definition of sensory overload, from its bright primary colors that scream “Look at me!” to the loudness of the steel-drum-thumping syncopated calypso music.\n\nIt has two levels — rare for theme parks — and creates a completely immersive experience since nothing outside Super Nintendo World can be seen beyond the towering walls of Peach’s Castle and Mt. Beanpole. There is an augmented reality dark ride, a kid-friendly, slow-moving omni-mover ride and a Donkey Kong-themed coaster. Character performers dressed as Mario and Luigi greet members of the crowd in a roped-off area.\n\nDark Universe\n\nDark Universe is a throwback to Frankenstein’s monster, Dracula and the Invisible Man movies that launched Universal’s career in horror franchises.\n\nVisitors enter through a recreated central European village that has a storyline about vampires inhabiting the ground underneath. There is a dark ride through Frankenstein’s castle, a family-friendly coaster based on the werewolf legend and a tavern topped by a windmill with blades engulfed by flames every few minutes.\n\nThe Wizarding World of Harry Potter-Ministry of Magic\n\nThis is the third installment of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attractions that turbocharged the Florida resort into a genuine challenger to Disney World’s dominance.\n\nThe arched doorways, wrought-iron balconies and cobblestoned streets make visitors feel like they have parachuted into the Fantastic Beasts films set in 1920s Paris. The land’s highlight is the Battle at the Ministry’s omnidirectional lift ride, whose green-tiled, faux-gold-plated atrium is on a scale reminiscent of New York’s Grand Central Terminal.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon — Isle of Berke\n\nNext-generation animatronic dragons are the stars in this section, based on the “How to Train Your Dragon” franchise.\n\nAnchored by a lagoon at its center with Viking statues, the Viking-inspired land has a coaster, a boat ride and meet-and-greets with the surprisingly agile dragons, these aren’t your father’s animatronics.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mike Schneider on the social platform Bluesky at @mikeysid.bsky.social."

            "content": "Mrs. Doubtfire's Matthew Lawrence expresses bad hope for an AI Robin Williams Fun fact: Zelda Williams once referred to ubiquitous AI copies of her dad's voice as a \"horrendous Frankensteinian monster.\"\n\nHave you ever been reading an interview—say, with Mrs. Doubtfire and Boy Meets World star Matthew Lawrence—and it all seems to be going okay? Like, standard Entertainment Weekly stuff: Lawrence talks about recently being on The Masked Singer, reminisces about Mrs. Doubtfire, reminisces about the ways Robin Williams would get really emphatic about how the 12-year-old Lawrence shouldn’t use drugs while they were hanging out on the set of Mrs. Doubtfire, etc. (Okay, that last one actually sounds a little… intense?) Then, you get to the final paragraph, and, bam! A real solid day ruiner of a quote: “Man, it’s a real shame that he’s not with us. There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t hear his voice. I even wish, now with artificial intelligence, I kind of want to go to his family and be like, would you guys allow me to use his voice for some sort of creative expression? Because I hear it every day, in my head.”\n\nBoy, that’s a stick jammed in the ol’ mental bike spokes, huh?\n\nIt will probably not shock you to learn, as a person living at least some part of their life on the internet, that Lawrence is not the first, or even probably the thousandth, person, to have that particular thought, i.e., “Boy, I bet Robin Williams’ incredibly vital energy and unique comedic talents could probably be replicated with AI!” In fact, it’s been so ubiquitous a yearning over the years that Williams’ daughter Zelda Williams had to put out a public statement all but begging people to stop back during the SAG-AFTRA strikes back in 2023, saying at the time that, “I’ve witnessed for YEARS how many people want to train these models to create/recreate actors who cannot consent, like Dad… I’ve already heard AI used to get his ‘voice’ to say whatever people want and while I find it personally disturbing, the ramifications go far beyond my own feelings… These recreations are, at their very best, a poor facsimile of greater people, but at their worst, a horrendous Frankensteinian monster, cobbled together from the worst bits of everything this industry is, instead of what it should stand for.” (Williams was talking specifically about studios trying to use actors’ likenesses, but we can’t imagine she’s any warmer to the dozens of knock-off AI tools that have flooded the market since, and which purport to be able to “recreate” her father’s distinctive voice, among many others.)\n\nAll of which makes the idea of Lawrence—and we’re sure he was just spitballing, but the intent sounded weirdly specific—coming to Williams’ family and asking them to endorse his “creative expression” some blend of baffling and horrifying. Robin Williams was one of the most recorded human beings on the planet; his voice, from the histrionic heights of his stand-up, to the naturalistic vibes he brought to many of his best acting roles, is not in short supply. Don’t bug his family to “make” more of it, no matter how loving the intent; there are a million better ways to pay tribute to the man’s legacy."

            "content": "Tonight’s (Apr. 18) episode of WrestleMania SmackDown ended with the final face-to-face confrontation between heel John Cena and WWE Champion Cody Rhodes before they fight over the belt on Sunday night (Apr. 20) at WrestleMania 41 in Las Vegas.\n\nCena did all the talking early on, where he doubled down on his “you people” approach of insulting all of WWE’s loser fans. You see, in order to be a winner in life, you have to sever ties with all the losers. When Cody rejected The Rock’s offer at Elimination Chamber and made the choice to do what’s right instead of doing what he needs to win, that’s when Cena realized that Cody won’t beat him at WrestleMania. Cody will be faced with the same choice on Sunday night at WrestleMania, and he will get it wrong again because he actually cares about what these losers think of him.\n\nRhodes began to respond at that point, and the crowd booed him.\n\nRhodes continued on with several shots at John that included him being paler than Sting at WCW Starrcade 1997. He finished it off by saying it’s 2025 and Cena still can’t wrestle. Cody seemed to win the fans back at that point as they were singing his name. Cena took that moment to note that the fans are just like Cody because they don’t know what they want.\n\nCena said he doesn’t have to wrestle to beat Cody on Sunday, and that’s when he suckered him in with a cheap shot. John tried to give Rhodes an Attitude Adjustment, but Cody slipped behind him and laid out Cena with his Cross Rhodes finishing move. That’s very similar to the way their promo battle ended the last time we saw John on WWE programming back on March 31, except this time boos could be heard.\n\nWhat do you make of the live crowd’s reaction to Cody Rhodes during this segment? Does reverse momentum theory mean John Cena is a big favorite to beat Rhodes and break the career world championship record at WrestleMania 41? Let me know in the comments below, Cagesiders."

            "content": "Here come the vamps. Photo: Warner Bros./Everett Collection\n\nSpoilers ahead for the plot and ending of Sinners.\n\nRyan Coogler’s Sinners ends at its beginning: in the film’s first scene, we witness a young man named Sammie (Miles Caton) driving up to a small churchhouse in the middle of rural Mississippi in 1932. He’s bloodied and injured, with deep gashes along his cheek, carrying the neck of a guitar. His father, the pastor of this church, embraces his son, begging him to drop the guitar and turn away from music. In the next scene, Coogler takes us back in time to the morning before, with Sammie’s twin cousins Smoke and Stack (Michael B. Jordan, pulling double duty) returning from Chicago with a small bit of money earned from less-than-legal dealings with Al Capone. They intend to open a juke joint where their gifted blues musician cousin might be able to sing a song or two. It’s a nice idea, with both brothers eager to mend old wounds from the last time they were home.\n\nBut just as the sun sets and the jazz begins, vampires swarm the place. A dance party turns into a full-blown massacre: Stack and his old fling Mary (Hailee Steinfeld) get turned into vampires, Smoke and his estranged wife Annie (Wunmi Mosaku) die from their wounds, and several other friends and loved ones go in the process. When Sammie returns to his father’s church the next morning (the whole film takes place over roughly 24 hours), he’s the only man still standing from the previous night. Well… until the credits roll, when the first of two post-credits sequences recontextualizes that ending and much of what we saw in the two hours prior.\n\nAfter the first fade to black, Coogler takes us about sixty years into the future, to Chicago in 1992. Jazz legend George “Buddy” Guy — playing older Sammie, though he’s credited on IMDb as “Jazz Musician,” which implies that Guy maybe fought vampires in his youth — plucks away at a guitar in a bar. As the night winds down, two visitors pop by: Stack and Mary, dressed in lavish, colorful ’90s clothing. It turns out neither perished that night in the speakeasy — Mary got away before dawn and Stack struck a deal with his brother. Rather than kill his undead twin, Smoke instead told Stack he’d let him get away so long as he let Sammie live a full life. Though this seemingly goes against what Irish vampire gang leader Remmick (Jack O’Connell) tells Smoke — that the vampires have a kind of democratic socialist thing going on where they don’t splinter into factions — it seems as though Stack forgoes the group to honor Smoke, who he still loves, and his lingering fondness for his little cousin.\n\nWith his side of the bargain now met, Stack has come to see Sammie play one last time before drifting back into the Only Lovers Left Alive-type of lifestyle — aka looking cool, hanging out, and listening to live music, as one might assume a chill vampire would do if they had all of eternity ahead of them — he and Mary have taken up in their decades of vampiredom. They offer Sammie the immortality they’ve grown to cherish, but he refuses. He tells his cousin that up until the violence started, that night at the juke joint was the greatest of his life. Stack agrees: it’s the last time he saw his brother.\n\nIn the final post-credits scene, we see Sammie as a young man again, singing and playing “This Little Light of Mine” on the guitar we last saw smashed to bits after that violent night at the juke joint. As the prologue of the film explains, there are musicians whose skill can heal communities but also summon evil: we know that Sammie is one such musician. It’s a nice to see Caton playing and singing again, his debut role a remarkable introduction to this young actor. But the scene itself could be read as a little ambiguous, too: is Sammie trying to pierce the veil again, playing a song that could both foster community but also bring back the vampires? Is it just another showcase for Caton in his first feature? Who might be waiting on the threshold of his father’s church when the song is over? We don’t see what comes next — but Sammie does."

            "content": "Blue Origin's all-female crew successfully made it to space, but when it comes to whether they are considered astronauts, former federal guidelines are bringing them back down to Earth.\n\nEarlier this week, Blue Origin's star-studded female flight crew, which included singer Katy Perry and journalist Gayle King, reached the edge of space and entered orbit. Their automated flight marked a milestone for commercial space travel but also sparked controversy and discussion along the way, especially over what it truly takes to earn the title of \"astronaut.\"\n\nIn an April 17 post on X, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy described the team as \"brave and glam\" but underscored why the team lacks the achievements and criteria it takes to be recognized by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as astronauts, a designation that has a high bar.\n\n“The U.S. commercial space industry is an inspiring project which showcases American ingenuity and exceptionalism,” Duffy wrote in his post. “But the last FAA guidelines under the Commercial Space Astronaut Wings Program were clear: Crewmembers who travel into space must have ‘demonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety, or contributed to human space flight safety.’”\n\nThe flight's six women — which, in addition to Perry and King, included aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, film producer Kerianne Flynn, and journalist Lauren Sánchez, who is notably engaged to Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos — are highly accomplished in their respective fields.\n\nBut when it comes to their space journey, Duffy says they do not meet the FAA’s criteria.\n\n“The crew who flew to space this week on an automated flight by Blue Origin were brave and glam, but you cannot identify as an astronaut,” continued Duffy’s post about the proper terminology regarding what they achieved. “They do not meet the FAA astronaut criteria.”\n\nWho is considered an astronaut?\n\nThe answer to this varies depending on who you ask.\n\nThe FAA's now-retired Commercial Space Astronaut Wings Program required travelers to meet two standards: flown at least 50 miles above Earth and performed duties essential to public or human spaceflight safety.\n\nKatie Perry and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos YouTube\n\nThe FAA’s Commercial Space Astronaut Wings Program was established in 2004 and officially ended in 2021 in anticipation of the commercial space tourism era. Still, the Wings Program continues to maintain a complete list of FAA Commercial Space Astronaut Wings recipients. Bowe, Nguyen, Flynn, King, Perry, and Sánchez are all recognized on the website but are not listed as recipients of the FAA's Commercial Space Astronaut Wings, as none of them held operational roles while on board.\n\nOutside FAA standards, NASA defines an astronaut as someone selected to join its astronaut corps and who has made \"star sailing\" their profession.\n\nMeanwhile, Merriam-Webster also uses profession as a defining factor, noting the term refers to \"a person whose profession is to travel beyond Earth’s atmosphere.\" In its broader definition, the dictionary defines an astronaut as \"any person who travels beyond the Earth’s atmosphere.\""

Its plot is at least mildly reminiscent of 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but it’s both fair and unfair to compare the two. Unfair in that Winter Soldier is still among the best-regarded MCU movies, while BNW is running uphill from table-setting a potential new Captain America franchise, dealing with post-production rewrites and reshoots, and the general malaise of the MCU’s post-Avengers: Endgame audience. But fair in that, like Winter Soldier, BNW was also clearly designed as a grounded thriller (by the sliding scale of “grounded” in the MCU) featuring global political stakes and a superpowered conspiracy at its heart.\n\nThe Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie\n\nWhere to watch: Available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu\n\nGenre: Sci-fi comedy\n\nRun time: 1h 31m\n\nDirector: Pete Browngardt\n\nCast: Eric Bauza, Candi Milo, Peter MacNicol\n\nThe newest Looney Tunes movie was supposed to be released on Max — but then Warner Bros. decided to can a bunch of animation projects.

            "description": "As \"Pride and Prejudice\" celebrates 20 years, director Joe Wright and production designer Sarah Greenwood discuss their experiences shooting the film.",
            "content": "In the 2005 film adaptation of “Pride and Prejudice,” the central love story between Elizabeth and Darcy is set in motion during a ball. It’s a rowdy, exuberant scene full of carefree dancing and whispered observations about the other attendees.\n\nThat’s also director Joe Wright‘s favorite scene. Not too long ago, Wright rewatched his debut feature, which Focus Features is bringing back to theaters this weekend in recognition of the film’s 20th anniversary. “The first ball, the community dance, I’m very proud of that scene. It has a kind of energy and a vitality and a messiness and joy,” Wright tells Variety.\n\nIn the scene, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) first spots Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) — “the person with the quizzical brow” —and then overhears him insulting her appearance. It’s also where viewers are introduced to Elizabeth as a young woman with sharp wit, who has a retort ready for Darcy when the two later converse.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe joy in the ballroom characterizes the film as a whole. When Wright came on board to direct “Pride and Prejudice,” he felt strongly that the film should evoke the lively nature of youthful romance as well as a “realism, a sense of mess.”\n\nHis intentions are evident in the amount of buoyant, contagious laughter in so many of the scenes featuring the Bennet sisters. There’s the oldest, Jane (Rosamund Pike) followed by our protagonist Elizabeth, then Mary (Talulah Riley), Kitty (Carey Mulligan) and Lydia (Jena Malone). Wright recalls initially thinking he should cast actors who looked similar and realizing that it would be an incredibly difficult endeavor. So instead, “in rehearsals…we developed a laugh so that they all had the same laugh, and that that was what unified them,” he says.\n\nCourtesy of Focus Features\n\nThe enthusiasm of the characters was reflected in the people who worked on it. Wright says despite it being his debut feature, he wasn’t intimidated by the prospect of tackling “Pride and Prejudice” and making the novel’s first film adaptation since the 1940 version starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. “I was very young and reckless, and I didn’t feel the Austen pressure. I felt a pressure to make the best film I could possibly make,” he says.\n\n“It was made in a moment of joy and excitement,” Wright adds. “Austen doesn’t need me. I’m not going to change her legacy with a movie like this, but I was so excited by her talent, by her fierceness, by her emotional, psychological honesty.”\n\nProduction designer Sarah Greenwood also remembers that momentum on set, created from people who were starting off in their careers. “We were all at the same level,” she says.\n\nThe film went on to garner Oscar nominations for Knightley’s performance, Greenwood and Katie Spencer’s art direction and set decoration, Jacqueline Durran’s costume design and Dario Marianelli’s score.\n\nOf course, “Pride and Prejudice” had already been adapted successfully in the modern era, namely through the 1995 BBC series led by Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. “They set us a very high bar. And our approach was a different approach, but did it justice,” Greenwood says.\n\nOne of the ways this adaptation distinguishes itself is through its emphasis on youth. Wright, pointing out that Austen herself was 21 when she wrote the novel, wanted to cast actors who basically matched the characters’ actual ages in the novel. “What I felt most importantly was that Elizabeth Bennet was 18 in the book, and I wanted to make sure that whoever played her was the correct age, that it was a story about people falling in love for the first time, not the second, third or fourth time,” Wright says.\n\nAnother distinction was the fact that this version is placed in 1797, around the time Austen wrote the novel, compared to 1813 when it was published. Greenwood says the film adheres more to the Georgian era rather than the Regency period. “You look at the BBC version, and that’s very Regency, and it’s very tight-laced and high-waisted,” she says.\n\nAnd in line with the change in time period, Wright envisioned the Bennet home, Longbourn, as a place of bustling conversation. “I wanted this loud, busy household in which everyone is constantly talking over each other to try and be heard. And so that’s the atmosphere I was creating, which is quite contrary to any of the period movies that I’d seen before,” Wright says, citing Robert Altman as an influence for the dialogue. “However, I wasn’t doing it to be contrary. I was just trying to convey what I conceived to be the reality and the truth of what it must have been like in that household.”\n\nThe home is also far from pristine. In fact, there’s plenty of dirt and animals trotting around the house — a tangible way of indicating the family’s lack of wealth compared to characters like Darcy and his friend, Charles Bingley.\n\n“What we wanted visually to get the feeling of was the fact that the farm, which was the estate [and] which would have produced all the wealth for the family, was just creeping in on them. It was just encroaching, and so the garden had gone to seed, and the animals were everywhere,” Greenwood says.\n\n“It was just the way of reinterpreting how they could have lived and making it slightly less mannered and slightly more real, which, in fact, is all in the book,” Greenwood continues.\n\nThe Bennet house grounds the story. “It’s like a lodestone in the film,” Greenwood says. “You constantly go back to the Bennet house. All these things happen, and you go back.”\n\nThe location for Longbourn was a house called Groombridge Place. Greenwood remembers the process of re-paneling the dark brown interiors so that the production could paint over everything. The task was “delicate and laborious, but because we were shooting in the house for six weeks, it was really worth doing,” Greenwood says.\n\nThe house ended up with more colors, including blues. Crucially, the paint was made to appear rundown with “lots of aging and patina.” “Nowadays, we have very strong modern chemical paints. We have cleaning products,” Greenwood says. “In those days, they didn’t. They could repaint, but they couldn’t afford it.”\n\nSimilarly, the actual antiques in the house are out of style compared to the fashionability of other wealthy homes since the family couldn’t redecorate. “Therefore, it feels very comfy and very lived-in. We made all the loose covers for the sofas that were all frayed and ratted and torn,” Greenwood says.\n\nMr. Bennet’s office, a cozy nook with bookshelves, serves as the patriarch’s den, Greenwood says. She worked on incorporating the personality of Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) into the space by giving the character a very specific pastime.\n\n“He’s a lovely man, but you don’t get the feeling that he pays much attention to [the estate]. And so it was giving him a hobby that was absolutely useless, there was no purpose to it. What they used to do at the time was… breeding and importing orchids. He’s up a ladder, and he gets an orchid down,” Greenwood says.\n\nIn one shot, viewers can see Kitty tying Lydia’s corset as the camera pans around their bedroom. Fashion plates are stuck onto the walls, in the same way a modern teenager’s room would have postcards or magazine cutouts tacked up. One can imagine the two youngest sisters sitting on their bedroom floor and extracting the fashion plate illustrations out of periodicals.\n\n“Why would a teenage girl in those days be different from a teenage girl today? There was a freedom. And I don’t think our Mrs. Bennet, played by Brenda Blethyn, would have chastised them much, she was not bothered. She was almost a child in her head herself,” Greenwood says.\n\nThe Bennet sisters’ free-spiritedness was crucial for Wright as he worked on bringing the character of Elizabeth to life with Knightley and the other artisans. He based Elizabeth on his own sister, an “anarchist punk in the 1980s who went and got a sledgehammer and helped smash down the Berlin Wall.”\n\nElizabeth tests social conventions and turns down proposals that she knows she cannot accept despite the pressure to get married as soon as possible. Her style in the film reflects her indifference to gender expectations.\n\nCourtesy of Focus Features\n\nCostume designer Durran’s experience working with filmmaker Mike Leigh led to her approaching the clothes “through the lens of a British realism,” according to Wright.\n\n“Everyone, all the other girls get to wear these lovely lilacs and pinks and sage greens, and Keira wears brown. There’s something defiantly unfeminine within the context of the times about her, about her costumes and her hair design, this short hair at the back, which we found a reference for, and we thought was interesting, because it created a kind of rebellion,” Wright says.\n\n“Elizabeth was far more interested in the notion of the mind, rather than in the notion of what she was supposed to be in terms of femininity or gender,” Wright adds.\n\nThe heroine’s independence, her effort to secure a life that she wants within patriarchal structures, is a crucial theme of “Pride and Prejudice.” And the happy ending is hard-earned.\n\nDuring the iconic rain scene in which Darcy shares his feelings for Elizabeth, seemingly out of nowhere, she rejects him, and two begin a thrilling, rapid-fire argument that reveals the misunderstandings they both hold about each other. “We worked almost like music. It was about rhythm. I’m always interested in the rhythm of human interactions,” Wright says.\n\n“I remember we were taking the dialogue quite slowly and thoughtfully, and actually, they’re not thinking, they’re just at each other. And so I remember in rehearsals once I said, ‘Okay, I just want you to run the scene as fast as you can, just the words. Don’t bother acting in it.’ They, really fast, sped through the dialogue. And I said, ‘Okay, that’s how I want the scene to go until that moment of recognition at the end when you look at each other’s mouths, and actually all you want to do is kiss each other.’ And so that was a bit of a discovery for us, but it’s quite technical,” he says.\n\nCourtesy of Focus Features\n\nFollowing Elizabeth’s refusal of Darcy’s proposal and the ensuing confusion she feels about her life, she struggles for clarity. There’s a shot of Elizabeth standing on a cliff, staring into a vast expanse as Marianelli’s score swells.\n\n“What I most loved there was, she’d been in this house, this stifling house with these nightmarish sisters who she loved so much and her mother’s pressure and [having] gone through this quite dark period of the story when she feels like all is lost,” Wright says. “Then there’s this breaking free of that.”\n\nWright took inspiration from David Lean and “big cuts from an extreme close-up of the match, cutting to the landscape of the sun rising in ‘Lawrence of Arabia.'”\n\n“The idea was this shocking cut between the close-up of her eyes, and then suddenly the orchestra. And here’s Dario coming in beautifully. The orchestra bursting out, and we cut to this gigantic wide shot filmed in Derbyshire at exactly the right time of the day,” Wright says. “And, yeah, Keira bounded out onto that cliff’s edge, and everyone freaked out and she was rushed back and they put a wire on her so she couldn’t fall off.”\n\nMarianelli’s romantic score endures on social media. Wright says he remembers being “blown away” by the compositions, which he calls “rhapsodies, almost, these outpourings of emotion.” Marianelli’s music can “express some of the emotions that the characters were required to, because of the social etiquette at the time, repress,” he says.\n\nThe romantic tension ramps up in the film when Elizabeth travels with her aunt and uncle to Pemberley, Darcy’s estate. Chatsworth House, which was supposedly what Austen had in mind for Pemberley when writing the novel, served as the filming location — but not without an initial hurdle.\n\nChatsworth was notorious for not allowing filming, according to Greenwood. “We said to Joe, ‘Well, we can go and look at it and see what we think of it, but, we can’t film here.’ And he said, ‘I don’t want to film here. I just want to have a look.’ So of course, we go there, and it’s absolutely stunning. It’s the most beautiful house. And Joe goes, ‘I want to film here,'” she says.\n\nCourtesy of Focus Features\n\nWright then wrote a letter to the resident, the Duchess of Devonshire, after which she extended an invitation to meet in person. Greenwood says the director was persuasive enough that the production could not just use Chatsworth, but to modify one of its rooms. The sculpture gallery in which Elizabeth admires a bust of Darcy originally had red velvet drapes, and the production was allowed to remove them. “To this day, these drapes have stayed down because the statuary looks so much better against the stone walls than the red velvet. The Victorians put the red velvet up, and we went in and took it down, and it never went back up,” Greenwood says.\n\nMost of the interactions at Darcy’s home were filmed in another location called Wilton House Salisbury.\n\nCollaboration was key to making the film. Wright remembers working with Emma Thompson, who wrote and starred in an adaptation of “Sense and Sensibility,” on the dialogue. “I remember a day when we went up onto Hampstead Heath together, and she started improvising Charlotte’s scene. “I’m 27,” that scene, and I was writing notes on her improvisations. And so she also gave me a sense of confidence in what we were trying to do,” Wright says.\n\nGreenwood similarly discussed artistic choices with Spencer and Durran. “It’s a very considered, joint effort, that everybody communicates so that nothing jars or stands out. The only pure primary color was the red of the soldiers, it’s things like that,” she says.\n\nShe thinks back to how English weather could be a challenge throughout the production and how everyone had to work together to find a solution. The scene in which Mrs. Bennet, cross with Elizabeth refusing Mr. Collins’s marriage offer, chases after her daughter and then goes back to get Mr. Bennet’s help in changing her mind.\n\n“She’s running across the bridge, and her dresses are all flapping, and the geese are going like that. That wasn’t planned. That happened because the light was coming in so low, and Roman [Osin], our DP, couldn’t balance the light for inside, and we didn’t have any time. And it was like, ‘What should we do?’ And Joe said, ‘Right, let’s send that scene outside to the lake because it’s so beautiful,’ and we had, I don’t know, five minutes to get it before the sun went down,” Greenwood says.\n\n“Everybody was gathering all the geese up and corralling them. And, ‘Okay, we’ve got one go at this!’ And it was like, bang, Brenda runs across the bridge with [her dress] flapping like this, and that is one of the most beautiful scenes. And you couldn’t have planned it,” she adds.\n\nLooking back on the film, Wright finds it jarring to mark 20 years, comparing the feeling to a time loop scene in the film, “The Man Who Wasn’t There.”\n\n“There’s a kind of time loop, and I’m sitting doing press for a movie, that is, as if it was made by someone else, and at the same time, as if it only happened yesterday,” Wright says.\n\nHe’s pleased to know that some of the young cast members went on to have fruitful careers. “I was going to say proud, but I’ve no right to be proud. I’m just so excited to see what’s happened to their careers and their personal lives. It’s a lovely thing,” Wright says.\n\nCourtesy of Focus Features\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that the interest in adapting Jane Austen continues, with Netflix’s own “Pride and Prejudice” TV series in the works. But the interest in the 2005 film isn’t fading anytime soon, as audience members venture to theaters to revisit this particular version of the famous love story.\n\n“It still is incredible and fresh and lovely today as it was then, which is really great to see because some films really age,” Greenwood says. “But yeah, this one doesn’t seem to.”"

With only a little more than 24 hours to go before the action starts at Allegiant Stadium, we don’t have to guess any more.\n\nWe found out on Friday’s edition of The Pat McAfee Show that WWE Women’s champion IYO SKY’s Triple Threat title defense against Bianca Belair and Rhea Ripley will open tomorrow’s show. WrestleMania 41’s second night will start with Royal Rumble winner Jey Uso challenging Gunther for his WWE World Heavyweight championship.\n\nCheck out the full line-up for this weekend’s Showcase of the Immortals here, and let us know if you think WWE picked the right openers in the comments below."

            "content": "Ralph Lauren unveiled the fall/winter 2025 collection in New York for an off-calendar runway show that brought the fashion community and celebrity set to Tribeca. The event was set inside the new Jack Shainman Gallery, a Gilded Age palazzo building and former Beaux-Arts bank designed with 29-foot-high coffered ceilings, Corinthian marble columns, and a grand winding staircase—a space that felt like it was plucked out of the beautiful Ralph Lauren universe. The star-studded guest list included Anne Hathaway, Naomi Watts, Michelle Williams, Ariana DeBose, Kacey Musgraves, Sarah Catherine Hook, Chase Sui Wonders, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who watched from the front row.\n\nTitled The Modern Romantics, Lauren’s vision solidifies the return of romance in fashion. Models walked the runway in soft Victorian blouses finished with ruffles, a sinuous velvet halter gown with a frilled collar, and a backless lace top paired with chandelier earrings and relaxed satin trousers—looks that at once felt vintage with nods to the archives, yet presented a new, nuanced vision of romantic style. As models stood along the staircase for the finale, Mr. Lauren took a bow from a balcony above, which erupted in a standing ovation as attendees clapped in applause.\n\n(Image credit: BFA)\n\nModern Romance\n\nFrom its dark, moody palette and elegant textures to soft dressing and ultraglamorous evening gowns, romance took on many forms on the Ralph Lauren runway. The show was a study of dichotomies and tensions, including \"plays of masculine-and-feminine and rugged-and-refined,\" as mentioned in the show notes. Slip dresses were paired with leather riding boots. Ruffled shirts and sweeping chandelier earrings were styled with aged leather jackets and tailored trousers. Intricate lace dresses were topped with leather belts and silver jewelry. The collection was an exploration of romantic Americana style through Ralph Lauren's distinct lens.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images/Ralph Lauren)\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images/Ralph Lauren)\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images/Ralph Lauren)\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images/Ralph Lauren)\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images/Ralph Lauren)\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images/Ralph Lauren)\n\nA Star-Studded Front Row\n\nAs guests arrived for the fall 2025 show, a star-studded set of celebrities took their seats on the front row. Their looks showcased the many sides of Ralph Lauren style—Kacey Musgraves in a cowboy hat and conch belt, Anne Hathaway in ripped metallic trousers, Sadie Sink in a pleated skirt, Eiza González in a navy blazer with gold metal buttons, and Sarah Catherine Hook in a camel coat with a coordinating tie.\n\nAnne Hathaway, Michelle Williams, and Naomi Watts (Image credit: BFA/Ralph Lauren)\n\nEiza González, Kacey Musgraves, and Andra Day (Image credit: BFA/Ralph Lauren)\n\nAriana DeBose, Sadie Sink, and Sarah Catherine Hook (Image credit: BFA/Ralph Lauren)\n\nAccessories of Note\n\nThe collection was accessorized with shoes, bags, belts, and jewelry that had the front row buzzing. Chandelier earrings are on the rise, and Ralph Lauren's iconic version felt plucked from the fashion house's deep set of archives. New this season on the runway is the Quinn, a bootie that riffs on the classic cowboy boot—and a style that is set to be a fashion-insider favorite once it's released. The Ralph Satchel was another new debut. Part of the Ralph handbag range that launched for spring 2025, its design is inspired by Mr. Lauren’s collection of high-performance cars.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images/Ralph Lauren)\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images/Ralph Lauren)\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images/Ralph Lauren)\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images/Ralph Lauren)\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images/Ralph Lauren)"

            "content": "Despite some stumbles along the way, most fans agree The Mandalorian season 3 ended strong with a season finale that felt conclusive (mostly). With The Mandalorian & Grogu set to take over cinemas worldwide in May 2026 and a New Republic-era event movie in active development, it sure looks like the characters' future is tied to the big screen.\n\nAt Star Wars Celebration Japan, longtime collaborators Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau introduced Sigourney Weaver as a veteran Rebel pilot who now holds a high rank as a member of the New Republic's military forces. In fact, the leaked footage (you'll have to look around) teases she's the person Din Djarin is responding to, at least during the bulk of the movie, while he works for the new galactic government hunting down the remaining Imperial warlords that refuse to surrender.\n\nAnother actor now confirmed to be part of the ensemble is Jeremy Allen White (The Bear) as Rotta the Hutt, son of the now deceased Jabba. If you've watched The Clone Wars you might remember a certain little Stinky the Huttlet…. well, the big twist is that Rotta is buff now and fighting in gladiatorial arenas.\n\nWriter-director Jon Favreau and the actress Sigourney Weaver stopped by the Star Wars Celebration's live stage to discuss her involvement in the next theatrical Star Wars installment, which aims to reignite the franchise's big-screen presence before we move on to new stories such as the just-announced Star Wars: Starfighter. You can watch the extensive conversation below:\n\nJon Favreau and Sigourney Weaver | Star Wars Celebration LIVE! - YouTube Watch On\n\nFor those who can't find recordings of the footage online or just want to learn some tidbits without actually watching it, we've got you covered: The teaser begins with Din Djarin, the titular Mandalorian, assaulting a massive AT-AT walker from the inside in one continuous shot that's beautifully choregraphed. He later blows up the big vehicle with explosives and flies away with his trusty jetpack and Grogu.\n\nAt this point, Weaver's character (not named yet) is introduced and we get fast shots of a new Razor Crest ship for the duo, Din walking alongside Zeb Orrelios, and Grogu using the Force and even swimming. Another huge action sequence, likely tied to the starting one, takes place on a snowy planet and has the two characters running away from a convoy of AT-ATs on a bipedal walker.\n\nThe Mandalorian & Grogu is coming to cinemas on May 22, 2026."

Uso is coming in gun blazing, not because he is tired of being on the receiving end of GUNTHER's ruthless strike force, but because \"The Anomaly\" crossed a line he can't uncross after brutalizing Jey's brother Jimmy right in front of him. Uso made a promise that before his opening match tomorrow night, he will pray for forgiveness as what he's about to do to GUNTHER might go against one (or a few) of The Ten Commandments.\n\nBefore tomorrow night, GUNTHER currently stands as the second longest World Heavyweight Champion with a 254-day reign. He won the championship against Damian Priest at last year's SummerSlam. Meanwhile, last year was a major milestone for Uso when he captured the WWE Intercontinental Championship, the first singles title he had in his 14-year run."

            "content": "A federal judge on Friday denied Sean “Diddy” Combs’ bid to delay his sex trafficking trial by two months.\n\nCombs’ attorneys had asked U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian in a letter Wednesday for a two-month adjournment to better prepare a defense. Marc Agnifilo, one of Combs’ attorneys, had suggested at a hearing Monday that they would seek a two-week delay.\n\nIn denying the delay, Subramanian said that Combs has at least four attorneys and that he would not allow a “fishing expedition” to seek more evidence.\n\nSign up for the “Diddy on Trial” newsletter for key developments and analysis\n\nThe matter was among a series of motions Subramanian ruled on Friday during a two-hour hearing. He also rejected a defense motion to dismiss counts three and five, which relate to transportation to engage in prostitution.\n\nCombs, 55, who is detained at a federal jail in Brooklyn, awaiting his trial in May, has pleaded not guilty to five criminal counts, including sex trafficking and racketeering. Opening statements are scheduled to start May 12. The trial is projected to last eight to 10 weeks.\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs on Oct. 25, 2019 in Los Angeles. Scott Dudelson / Getty Images file\n\nThe letter said prosecutors have been slow to turn over evidence, including information related to a third superseding indictment returned by a grand jury this month that focuses on a woman identified only as Victim-2. The latest indictment added two additional charges — one count each of sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. Those counts bolstered charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution that Combs was indicted on in September. Combs’ team had told the judge it needed more time to address the additions to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment alleges Combs forced women to participate in drug-fueled sexual encounters with male sex workers called “freak offs,” that he arranged, directed and often filmed.\n\nAlso Friday, Subramanian granted a request from the prosecution that Victim-2, Victim-3 and Victim-4 be allowed to use pseudonyms at trial. In a filing April 4, prosecutors said three of the four accusers who are expected to testify have asked that their identities not be revealed to the press or the public and that they instead be referred to at trial using only pseudonyms. The women’s names are known to Combs’ legal team and will be known to the jurors.\n\nOne of Combs’ attorneys, Teny Geragos, argued Friday that Victim-3 has made public statements, and that her attorney has told the defense team that she is “meh” when it comes to remaining anonymous. Geragos said that it hinders the defense to allow Victim-4 to remain anonymous as she would be hiding behind a pseudonym.\n\nVictim-1, whose allegations closely align with those made by his former longtime girlfriend Casandra Ventura in a civil lawsuit she filed against Combs in November 2023, is prepared to testify under her own name, prosecutors said in the filing. Subramanian said that Ventura must produce all prior drafts to her unpublished memoir to the defense by April 25. A defense request for her bank statements was denied because Subramanian said they were not relevant. Her attorney, Doug Wigdor, was seated in the front row of the gallery.\n\nCombs and Ventura quickly settled her lawsuit in 2023 without him admitting any wrongdoing. Her lawsuit preceded federal raids on his homes in Los Angeles and Miami Beach and the criminal charges.\n\nThe latest indictment relates to a woman prosecutors described as “Victim-2,” and accuses Combs of using force, fraud or coercion to compel her to engage in commercial sex acts from at least 2021 to 2024. The third superseding indictment also alleges that Combs was involved in transporting “Victim-2” and others, including commercial sex workers, to engage in prostitution during the same time frame.\n\nThe prosecution and defense will submit final proposals for the jury questionnaire by Tuesday. Combs’ team has asked the judge to allow prospective jurors to be questioned about their views on drug and alcohol abuse, sex and violence.\n\nThe prosecution has argued in a court filing that the defense team’s prospective questionnaire, which contains 72 questions, is too long. By comparison, the prosecutors’ proposed survey contains 23 questions. The prosecution expressed concern in court Friday about asking jurors to disclose their history with sexual abuse in writing, which Combs’ legal team has proposed. They agreed that the questionnaire would give jurors the option to discuss the matter in private.\n\nCombs appeared solemn and anxious throughout the hearing. After it was over, court officers allowed him to turn his chair around and face his mother, Janice Combs, who was seated in the gallery. He told her, “I love you; everything will be all right.”\n\nAnother hearing is scheduled for next week."

            "content": "John Cena's the bad guy in his final WrestleMania. Here's why that's a big deal\n\ntoggle caption Georgiana Dallas/WWE via Getty Images\n\nFor most of John Cena's WWE career, you couldn't see him being a bad guy on TV.\n\nCena has won a record 16 WWE world championships since debuting in 2002. He's taken on the biggest names in wrestling, including The Rock, The Undertaker, Randy Orton and CM Punk. His heroic performances earned him the often-meant-in-jest nickname \"SuperCena.\"\n\nAgainst all seeming odds, during critical matches, Cena would spring back up, hit his finishing move and pin his opponents.\n\nAnd he's done most of that as a \"babyface,\" or the good guy in the ring. Cena's gimmick endeared him to wrestling's youngest fans throughout the years so much so that he became the Make-A-Wish Foundation's most requested celebrity wish granter. In 2022, he set the Guinness World Record for most wishes granted.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut this weekend, Cena heads into what is slated to be his final WrestleMania – the biggest showcase in wrestling – as a heel. He's taking on defending WWE champion Cody Rhodes and, if he wins, Cena would break the record for most WWE world championships.\n\nCena announced last year that he would retire from in-ring competition at the end of 2025. He shocked fans in March by attacking Rhodes, after securing a title match, and made his heel turn official.\n\nYouTube\n\nSince then, Cena has lambasted WWE crowds for their love-hate relationship with him and promised to \"ruin wrestling\" for everyone.\n\n\"I will win that championship and retire with it. I am taking it home with me!\" Cena proclaimed to a crowd at the March 24 episode of WWE Raw. \"I will be the last real champion in WWE.\"\n\nSo is his time really up? And why is Cena's heel turn such a big deal to wrestling fans?\n\nMorning Edition explored these questions and Cena's evolution with David Shoemaker, a writer for culture website The Ringer and host of its wrestling podcast, The Masked Man.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nA Martínez: The wrestling world has a word for this, the heel turn. So how big of a deal was it when John Cena did it?\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDavid Shoemaker: It was a really big deal, one, because John Cena, like you said, hadn't been a heel for the 20 years of his fame. He's just been known as the most consistent babyface, as they say in the business. It was also a big deal from a fan's perspective because we've been begging for him to turn heel for most of those 20 years. We're used to seeing our wrestlers go back and forth on the spectrum. And John Cena has been a stalwart, refusing to embrace the dark side for this whole time.\n\nMartínez: Now, on WWE Raw last month, Cena sounded like he kind of enjoys playing the bad guy. Why would you want to go out like this? I mean, is this something that fans actually like? I mean, you said you've been clamoring for, but does everyone else feel that way?\n\nShoemaker: I talk to wrestlers all the time. Most of them prefer playing heel. It's more fun. You get to just ham it up out there for the fans also. They all know that boos are just as good as cheers in their line of work. Will he go out as a heel? This is his final year. My guess is that his last month will probably be as a fan favorite because you can always go home again. But for right now, he's getting to do the thing that he's always wanted to do, too. I mean, it's not just the fans. He's talked openly about wanting this opportunity, wanting to play the bad guy. And I think you can tell from his monologues in the ring he's really enjoying it.\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Timms/WWE via Getty Images\n\nMartínez: Now, last month, there was another star of the big screen in the ring, coaxing Cena to go over to the dark side. And that was The Rock. So, I mean, what does it mean that these two mega movie stars are playing wrestling villains? Is he following The Rock's footsteps here?\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShoemaker: He is in a lot of ways. The Rock came back last year and teased a WrestleMania main event match, and he was a hero and he thought everybody would get behind him. But after he took the spot from Cody Rhodes, the fans turned and said, \"No, we don't want that. We want Cody. He's the guy that we've been following all this time.\" And the Rock played it on the fly and turned heel. And it turned out to be the best move he could make. I think there was a lot of conventional wisdom that a Hollywood star, the level of The Rock, couldn't play heel because it would jeopardize his mainstream appeal. It would make those rope line interviews awkward or whatever. But it turned out to be the best business decision he could have made. He's more famous now and then he possibly could have been. Everybody just took it in stride. And I think you're seeing the same thing with John Cena.\n\nMartínez: Do you think he's really going to retire?\n\nShoemaker: Well, pro wrestlers are really bad at retiring famously, just like boxers, you know. I mean, you usually retire at the end of a match when everybody's watching you because you want that moment in the sun, right? And then two months later, you're sitting at home and you don't have anything to do and you change your mind. But of all the wrestlers that have ever said they're going to retire, John Cena is one that I believe. He's a man, it seems to be, of real conviction outside of the ring and would not be doing this without having really thought it through.\n\nTreye Green edited this digital story.

            "content": "Aimee Lou Wood absolutely crushed it on The White Lotus’ third season, as her adoring Chelsea stole the show even amidst crazy storylines like the incestuous Ratliff brothers and the too-real female friendship. So it must be frustrating for Wood that her teeth keep coming up in conversation. The situation came to a head last weekend when the actress took issue with Saturday Night Live’s parody of her, and cast member Bowen Yang said Wood’s reaction was “completely valid.”\n\nChelsea’s story on The White Lotus (which can be streamed with a Max subscription) ended tragically, as both she and boyfriend Rick (Walton Goggins) were killed in a shootout at the titular resort. But much of the talk about her performance has been overshadowed by comments about her teeth. In “The White Potus” sketch that aired April 12 on the 2025 TV schedule, Sarah Sherman wore fake teeth in an apparent portrayal of Chelsea, which Aimee Lou Wood called “mean and unfunny.”\n\nBowen Yang understood the reaction, telling Extra:\n\nHowever she reacted to that sketch is completely valid. You kind of forget the sort of human, emotional cost that it sort of extols on someone.\n\nIn trying to produce relevant sketches for SNL Season 50 host Jon Hamm, it seems the writers at Saturday Night Live forgot to consider that it was a real person’s physical appearance they were making a joke about, not just a fictional character on TV.\n\nAimee Lou Wood had made it clear she was over talking about her teeth, and Bowen Yang said the situation served as a reminder for the SNL writers to consider the impact of their jokes. In Yang’s words:\n\nYou need those reminders every now and then that parody can go too far sometimes, and that we as comedians can take account for that instead of banging our foot and saying that, like, we should be allowed to say whatever we want because that’s just the culture.\n\nIn the days that followed, Aimee Lou Wood was seen sobbing in South London, with many jumping to the conclusion that she was upset about her SNL portrayal. However, she clarified that her woes were “completely unrelated” to the NBC sketch show drama. You can see “The White Potus\" sketch below:\n\nThe White Potus - SNL - YouTube Watch On\n\nThe actress also suggested on social media that she’d received “apologies from SNL,” but it turns out the apology was not made in an official capacity on behalf of Saturday Night Live, but rather was a personal gesture from someone she knows on the show. That might have been Sarah Sherman herself, who did send Aimee Lou Wood flowers in the aftermath of the sketch, as the actress showed them off on social media.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nPeacock TV: from $7.99 a month/$79.99 a year\n\nTune into Saturday Night Live and the other latest hits from NBC and Bravo by subscribing to Peacock TV.

With The Mandalorian & Grogu set to arrive next year, fans had been wondering about the next theatrical installment, and now we know it'll be a post-Skywalker Saga standalone titled Star Wars: Starfighter .\n\nNo, this movie won't be connected to the 2001 flight sim video game of the same name. Instead, it will take place \"approximately five years\" after the events of 2019's The Rise of Skywalker . Little is known about the story at this point, though recurring rumors are pointing to Jedi (or at least Force-sensitive characters) being a big part of the plot, even if the movie isn't a direct follow-up to the sequel trilogy. Shawn Levy ( Deadpool & Wolverine ) will be directing from a script written by Jonathan Tropper (The Adam Project). Ryan Gosling (Blade Runner 2049) is now confirmed to star in the project.\n\nThe Star Wars social media accounts also shared a 20-second teaser with the logo and some epic music to announce the May 28, 2027, release date. Despite what the title might suggest, the use of the 'light of the Jedi' symbol right at the center backs up the aforementioned rumors. Watch it below:\n\nStar Wars: Starfighter - Official Teaser Trailer | Star Wars Celebration 2025 - YouTube Watch On\n\nAt some point, renowned Hollywood insider Jeff Sneider teased Daisy Ridley's Rey Skywalker would have a small role in this story , paving the way for her own movie and the post-IX state of the galaxy. That project remains in active development alongside an all-new trilogy and other unrelated theatrical entries , according to today's press release from Disney and Lucasfilm.\n\nMeanwhile, casting seems to be underway for other major roles. Earlier this week, it was reported that Anora star Mikey Madison had passed on the movie , and Jesse Plemons (Civil War) might be one of the big names circling a villainous role.

            "content": "A batch of letters and notes gives a glimpse into the lives of Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa, which have been released as part of the investigation into their tragic deaths earlier this year, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nAt the time of his death, Hackman had been battling Alzheimer’s disease, and Arakawa was his primary caregiver. The notes between them offer not only a window into the relationship of a long-married couple (they wed in 1991), but also gesture towards the challenges of Alzheimer’s, both for those living with it and those of their caregivers.\n\nArakawa, for instance, reportedly wrote detailed notes on Hackman’s medication and doctor appointments. She also frequently left Hackman notes around the house, telling him where she was or what she was doing (such as taking one of their dogs to an obedience class, or doing yoga).\n\nThe notes from Hackman, meanwhile, show that the actor seemed to retain a sense of humor that was light-hearted and occasionally self-deprecating. Of a doctor’s visit, for instance, he told Arakawa — often referred to as “Lovely girl” — he was “off to see the wizard, the wizard of achievement pokie. She stabs me here, she stabs me there, she stabs me almost everywhere. But I’ll survive, because after [all] I’m still alive. (But sometimes just barely).”\n\nIn another letter, Hackman even seemed to acknowledge, and make light of, his waning memory. “I’m going down to that building out past the hot water place where you sit and do whatever it is that people are supposed to do in such a building — maybe I’ll remember once I get down there,” he wrote.\n\nWhile frequently Hackman signed his letters “Love G,” he signed this one, “Love what’s his name.”\n\nStill, his notes occasionally hinted at more difficult moments, like when he wished Arakawa a belated happy birthday and wrote her, “Sorry still about the dinner and having to ask for your help, although it was appreciated.” Trending Stories First Corporate-Sponsored White House Easter Egg Roll Draws Trump Pals Amazon, Google, Meta Being Trans in Country Is Dangerous. It Didn’t Stop This Singer From Coming Out Zak Is Back, the Who’s Pete Townshend Says: ‘Not Being Asked to Step Down’ Count the Dead by the Millions\n\nAlong with the letters, Santa Fe authorities investigating the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa released new photos of the couple’s home, police body camera footage, and an environmental assessment. Hackman’s estate had previously secured a temporary order to seal any records related to the investigation, but a judge later overturned that ruling on the condition that no photos or videos showed the couple’s bodies.\n\nHackman and Arakawa were found dead in their Santa Fe home in February, with a medical examiner ultimately ruling that they died about six days apart. Arakawa likely died on Feb. 11 from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but fatal respiratory disease spread by rodents (the environmental assessment released this week revealed that rodent feces, nests, and dead rodents were found on the couple’s property, but not the main home). Hackman died on Feb. 18 from heart disease, with his advanced Alzheimer’s also a contributing factor."

Yang fully committed to the scene, which sees his character awaking in horror the morning after and briefly flashing his bare butt as he jumps out of bed.\n\n\"It was something that for anyone other than Andrew Ahn, I would've been like, 'Let's talk about coverage,' and 'I'm not going to show nip,' and 'I'm not going to show butt,'\" Yang tells Entertainment Weekly of the memorable scene. \"I would've gotten really granular about that. But there was just something about playing the comedy of that scene, which is such a shocking moment. And then you're supposed to believe that these two people are so good about moving past it and then immediately having to de-queer the house in a way that cleanses the stakes.\"\n\n\n\nKelly Marie Tran, Lily Gladstone, Han Gi-chan and Bowen Yang in 'The Wedding Banquet'.

Okay, bye!'\"\n\nAnd while butt pads have played a considerable role in Hollywood lately, Yang shares that the butt on screen was the real deal. \"You will be able to tell from the flat topography of my buttocks that I bare it all,\" he quips.\n\nAhn's remake remains true to Lee's original film while also incorporating some modern sensibilities. As Chris, Yang is the commitment-phobic boyfriend of Min (Han Gi-chan), the closeted heir to a Korean corporate empire working in the States on a visa that will soon expire. When Chris rejects his marriage proposal, Min hatches a plan with their close friends Angela (Kelly Marie Tran) and Lee (Lily Gladstone), a couple struggling with a series of unsuccessful and costly IVF treatments as they try to start a family: a sham marriage to Angela in order to obtain his green card. In return, Min will pay for Lee's next round of IVF treatments. Chaos ensues when Min's formidable grandmother (played by Yuh-jung Youn) visits from Korea and insists on throwing her grandson the ultimate wedding banquet.\n\n\n\nHan Gi-chan, Yuh-jung Youn, and Kelly Marie Tran in 'The Wedding Banquet'.

That's how drawn into that world and this group of friends I am.'\"\n\n\n\nFor Yang, starring in the remake feels like a meaningful, full-circle moment. \"I had seen [the original] in college. I would go to the library at NYU and I would just post up with the DVDs — oh my gosh, this is really aging me,\" the comedian jokes. \"I remember being pretty blown away by this idea that films that you didn't realize were out there have been impactful in the culture and in cinema. I just remember watching it at a time when I thought my parents would never accept this thing about me. I'd come out to my parents, then I went back in the closet after conversion therapy. It gives me this check-in point now to where my family just accepts that part of me and embraces it.\"\n\nThey even pester him about his love life now, Yang shares. \"I never thought we would get there. When I think back on the movie, I do think about the strides that have been made just within my family alone.\"\n\nThe Wedding Banquet is in theaters April 18.\n\n"

            "content": "WWEWWE Bret Hart Remembers the Night Everything Changed The beauty of Hart’s blood feud with “Stone Cold” Steve Austin is what happened after the ref stopped the match WWE/Getty Images/Ringer illustration\n\nBy Cameron Hawkins April 18, 12:20 pm UTC • 9 min\n\nListening to WWE Hall of Famer Bret Hart recount the story behind his WrestleMania 13 match with “Stone Cold” Steve Austin feels like sitting fireside, trying to toast your marshmallow without melting your Hershey bar. Twenty-eight years after what may be considered the greatest match in WWE history—one iconic enough to be the recipient of WWE’s inaugural Immortal Moment Award at this year’s Hall of Fame ceremony—Hart still serves as camp counselor, effortlessly guiding us through the key moments before, during, and after the event.\n\nBret Hart was a prominent figure in the World Wrestling Federation at the time. In 1997, he was among the company’s top tier of performers, alongside Shawn Michaels and the Undertaker. At the previous WrestleMania, Michaels had elevated himself to the upper echelon of WWF talent, defeating Hart in a 60-minute Iron Man match to win his first WWF Championship. However, citing a knee injury, Michaels announced that he’d “lost his smile” before vacating the title.\n\nThis paved the way for the rise of Steve Austin, who’d flirted with the main-event scene, having stellar matches with Hart along the way. The two had tangled in singles competition in a no. 1 contender’s match for the WWF Championship at Survivor Series 1996. That contest saw Hart outsmarting Austin, reversing Austin’s Million Dollar Dream submission into a pinfall for the win. “We were really proud of that match,” Bret remembers, “but when it was over, it was like, ‘Well, I probably won't wrestle Steve Austin until SummerSlam next year.’ We'll leave each other alone for a while, and we'll circle back when he's a bona fide babyface and see where our story is then.” Michaels’s departure led to the In Your House: Final Four pay-per-view with Hart, Austin, Vader, and the Undertaker battling it out for the vacant championship. Hart won the title, but lost it the following night on Raw to Sycho Sid due to Austin’s interference.\n\nIn many ways, their feud mirrored Austin’s WCW battles with Ricky Steamboat. The long-established crowd favorite Steamboat would do everything possible to fend off the super-talented but brash Austin. Austin gained victories, but never broke through to the next level. The two major differences between that feud and his beef with Bret were with how their actions were framed: Austin showed up anywhere and everywhere to insult and attack Bret. Instead of being seen as low-down and dirty, Austin’s actions were presented as intense and a showcase of his desire to win. Hart’s common-sense framing of Austin’s actions as against the standard was treated as whining and cowardice. The diverging attitudes allowed the two to trade roles as hero and villain, and in turn, Austin would figuratively and literally shatter the glass ceiling, with their WrestleMania 13 encounter being the signature match in Austin’s rise to superstardom.\n\nWith all of the controversial finishes surrounding their previous matchups and the high tensions every time they shared the same air, the WrestleMania match was held under submission rules, where you could only win by making your opponent submit. WWE employed the services of UFC great and future Intercontinental champion, “The World’s Most Dangerous Man” Ken Shamrock, to maintain order as the special guest referee. “[Shamrock] was a very intricate part of it. He brought that UFC vibe to the match. He did a good job of playing it down the middle and in not being middled either, where one of us made him look weak,” Hart explains. “It was really important to have a super respected character where you're not going to trifle with this guy. And even Steve had to respect Shamrock.” Austin came out first, with his entrance actually beginning backstage, showing off the “realism” of his attitude and outlook. A black glass frame reading “Austin 3:16” covered the entranceway and was dropped, shattering right before Austin entered the arena. He shrugged off attempts at handshakes from the fans, focused on the task at hand. Hart, meanwhile, was given his standard opening, only to be shown coming through the entranceway. He slapped a few hands and gave his signature shades to a kid at ringside.\n\nThey almost immediately started brawling, with Austin giving Hart a slight head tilt before taking him down by both legs. As they worked their way out of the ring and up to the press box, the cameras captured these perfect moments of freestyled warfare and unique visuals: Austin taking a moment mid-beatdown to drink a soda then throw it at Hart; Bret reversing a piledriver in the stairway in front of a guy wearing a bootleg nWo shirt; Shamrock being the only security personnel the fans actually moved for. It was extreme without looking cartoonish, hitting that sweet spot when you’re trying to make something in your control seem like it could go awry at any moment.\n\nAs they moved back to the ring, Hart employed one of his most visually impressive moves for the first time. He set up Austin in a figure-four leglock around the ringpost, with Bret applying it from outside of the ring, allowing him to lean back and use the ringside floor for additional leverage. “I've always loved how I put the figure-four on the post on Steve. I'd never done that before,” Bret shares. “I just tried to come up with at least one new move for a pay-per-view match, and I remember thinking up that move, and that was the first time we ever tried it.” The crowd went crazy for the spot, as Austin wailed and slapped the mat repeatedly, with his knee seemingly being wrenched right out of its socket. It became an ongoing signature move for “bad guy” Bret, as the hold was perfectly legal in a submission match, but violated the ring boundary rules of a standard match, so it could only be applied for a few seconds.\n\nWith neither man able to break the other’s will with the tools they usually brought to the table, it was time to dig deep into the shed. Hart and Austin arranged a callback for the moment that ultimately decided the match’s outcome. “I've always loved how I picked the bell up, and it's like, ‘I'm going to beat his brains in with this,’” Bret fondly remembers. “And then I would take it. It's like, ‘Wait a minute, maybe I'll use a chair instead.’” Hart first grabbed a commemorative WrestleMania 13 chair, but with its excess padding on the seat and back support, he decided to grab an all-metal option. “And that little bit of delay there picking out a weapon to beat somebody is so important to the story,” Bret explains, “because the bell, I'm just saying, ‘they'll forget all about the bell. Everybody will forget the bell.’”\n\nDuring a break in action, Austin played possum, then attacked Bret with the harder chair. He’d basically abandoned the Million Dollar Dream as a submission, so he attempted a few different holds to get Hart to submit, to no avail. Bret then threw Austin towards the ringside announce crew, with Austin’s head getting viciously cut open in the process. The two weren’t given permission to bleed in the match, but both felt it was necessary to highlight the intensity and physicality of their encounter. They were so sure of its importance that they didn’t clue anyone in on it, not even Shamrock, leading to the necessity of a second match of sorts later on that night. “When something happens between two wrestlers and somebody gets hurt for real, busted open or injured or something, there's usually an exchange of heated words back in the dressing room, and it's like, ‘What the hell are you doing?’” Bret explains. “So when Steve and I came back[stage], we got into it and started getting in a heated exchange,” which Bret says Austin orchestrated so that they wouldn’t get fined. “We had to use our own discretion there and say, We're going to break the rules because we have to in order to have this match be what we need it to be.”\n\nThe decision to have Austin, who’d been an unrelenting force with no regard for authority or order, show his humanity through bleeding was the right choice, as you could sense the tonal shift in Hart, who would in turn up the intensity. He’d repeatedly attack Austin’s knee with the chair to set him up for his patented Sharpshooter. Austin fought his way back into the match via eye poke, then floored Hart with a low blow, all the while bleeding profusely from the cut on his head. He went for the win in the most vicious of ways, going outside of the ring, grabbing an extension cord and wrapping it around Hart’s neck in an attempt to choke him out as he stood on the apron. Hart, remembering that perfectly placed bell, grabbed it and swung it over his shoulder into Austin’s head, incapacitating him in the middle of the ring. Hart then locked in the Sharpshooter, sending Austin through a range of emotions and expressions, yelling “NO!” at the top of his lungs while pounding the mat in frustration and rubbing his forearm across his head to try to maintain consciousness, not wanting to submit to Bret. With Shamrock begging him to respond, Austin produced one of the visuals that defined the “never say die” attitude he worked so hard to cultivate. With both palms on the mat, he’d give one last emotional plea, pushing up off the canvas, screaming, with the blood from his forehead leaking so heavily down his face that it started running into his mouth and down the middle of his teeth. He’d flip Hart over, leading the fans and commentators alike to wonder if he’d broken the hold that no one ever broke.\n\n“I remember telling him, ‘This would be iconic when you're in the Sharpshooter and you try to push out,’” Bret says. “Steve pushed and pushed and pushed and he tipped me over. And everybody thought, like, OK, he's going to be the first guy to get out of the Sharpshooter.’ And then I pushed back, and that was when he lost. But that was the heartbreak.” And in that instance, Bret knew: “They hated me now. They loved Steve.” Hart, who had spent years as a babyface, kept his hands clasped and once more leaned back. Try as Austin might, the pain would be too much, and Shamrock called the match after Austin could no longer respond. He’d passed out from the pain. Even in a loss, Austin never gave up. Bret would still earn cheers, but the win wasn’t enough for him, causing him to attack Austin once more after the match. Shamrock, who had called the action as fair as possible, put a waist lock takedown on Hart, who briefly sized Shamrock up before leaving the ring. To further solidify their new shift in character, Hart wouldn’t slap any of the fans’ hands on the way out, and gave the finger to a fan who’d decide to greet him the same way. Austin hit a Stunner on a referee who was trying to help him, making his way back to the locker room on his own terms. They hadn’t only won over the arena, but their peers knew just how special what they’d just seen was. “When I came back to the dressing room,” Bret says, “I remember Undertaker [who was main-eventing the show] looked at me and he goes, ‘I'm never going to top that match.’ And he was working with Sid, I think, for the title. And he wasn't mad. He had a big smile on his face. He really was proud of the match. It was like that match blew everybody away.”\n\nLater that night, Hart went full-fledged heel, costing Sid the world title and setting the stage for his anti-American Hart Foundation. Austin would start his year-long build towards dethroning Michaels for the championship at WrestleMania 14, kicking off WWE’s Attitude Era in the feud that led to the infamous Montreal Screwjob. Something that was built on such short notice, not rooted in hold after hold or a stipulation for which huge prop pieces are necessary, getting down in the dirt, creating a war of not just men but their ideologies, proved to be special in a way that’s heralded all these years later. Bret Hart always wanted to put on the very best matches and stories, so for his WrestleMania 13 match to be the first inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, it’s a testament to his ability to create great moments in any situation.\n\nDuring our conversation, Bret was appreciative of this match being a part of the WWE Hall of Fame. “I watched a lot of great wrestling as a kid, and I'll put that match up against any match. I'm glad they picked it to be the very first entry into the Hall of Fame because I watched so many great wrestlers in my lifetime.” And while Bret knows that he’s had a number of stellar bouts, including facing Davey Boy Smith in Wembley Stadium at SummerSlam 1992, or his Iron Man match against Michaels, Bret says that “this one was the most special. I really do think it was the best match in my career.”"

            "content": "For Woodstone’s Select Spirits For exclusive news and updates, subscribe to our Ghosts Newsletter:\n\n[Warning: The below contains MAJOR spoilers for Ghosts Season 4, Episode 19 “Pinkus Returns.”]\n\nGhosts delivered another big Season 4 twist with the arrival of pantless ghost Trevor’s (Asher Grodman) daughter, Abby (Gideon Adlon real-life sister of attic girl ghost Stephanie, Odessa A’zion), in the episode “Pinkus Returns.”\n\nAs viewers will recall, Pinkus (Richie Keen) is the colleague from Trevor’s past whom he gave his pants away to the fateful night he died, and in remembrance of Trevor’s good deed, Pinkus visited Woodstone with his daughter Abby. While Pinkus recounted the pants tale to living proprietors Sam (Rose McIver) and Jay (Utkarsh Ambudkar), he revealed Trevor’s pants had a phone number in the pocket.\n\nIt turned out that the number belonged to a woman named Lori Goldstein, whom Trevor briefly dated before his death. As Pinkus explained it, when Trevor didn’t show up to work after their work gathering at Woodstone in the ’90s, he rang the number to see if the person knew any information. One thing led to another, and Pinkus ended up dating and marrying Lori.\n\nThe catch? When Abby left the living room where stories were being retold, Pinkus revealed that his wife had told him on her deathbed that Trevor was Abby’s biological father. And so, the man had to decide if he could muster the courage to tell Abby the truth. But as the episode played out, viewers saw Trevor meddle by sending a text to sway Pinkus in the director of revealing the truth to Abby.\n\nUnfortunately for Trevor, his message sent from beyond the land of the living was delivered to the wrong Pinkus, directly informing Abby of her biological father’s identity. In order to repair the mess he made, Trevor managed to use his ghost power to make a moving slideshow of Abby and Pinkus’ father-daughter moments, set to the tune of Green Day‘s “Good Riddance,” to remind her of their bond and repair their relationship.\n\nThe hero’s move gave Trevor the satisfaction of knowing he was able to fix the situation and understand his daughter better. Below, Asher Grodman opens up about Trevor’s daughter twist and shares hopes for the future following the major reveal.\n\nWhat was your initial reaction to discovering Trevor had a long-lost daughter?\n\nAsher Grodman: A lot of excitement, definitely [some] trepidation. In the back of my mind, I’ve always thought this may be something that we do someday. I got to meet with our writers’ room before we started Season 4, and they told me this was something that was brewing, but that the details weren’t set. So you never know what’s going to come down the pipeline. But I had this idea that we might do something like this. I also remember the whole DILF thing from Season 1, so I always thought if we did do this, it’d be way down the line. But yeah, a lot of excitement and then a lot of like, “Alright, how do we do this justice and make sure it works?” And luckily, the writers did a great job, Skander [Halim] and Talia [Bernstein] killed it, and Christine Gernon, who directed, is just a godsend.\n\nIf a surprise child was bound to happen to anyone, it would be Trevor.\n\nHe is definitely a candidate for this. And also just a shout out to Richie [Keen], our producing director, who stepped in to play Pinkus, it was great. And then Gideon [Adlon], who killed it as Abby. So, just a lot of really talented people to help make this one happen.\n\nAbby’s introduction opens the door for a lot of storylines, with Trevor taking on a more paternal role. Would you like to see more of their father-daughter dynamic moving forward?\n\nI hope we do, and she’s great. I think it’s a great avenue for Trevor. I’ve said this a couple of times, but Trevor is at once a horrible candidate to be a parent, but at the same time, there is a part of him that is all about taking care of his found family. It’s the same impulse in him that gave away the pants. So he does have this other sweet side to him. It’s going to be fun to see this battle out within him. And then it’s the fun thing that this show does really well, which is that we’re all dealing with very serious issues. We’re a comedy about death, so that’s always two inches away. But at the same time, we live in existence like an 8-year-old who can be locked up in their room by their parents. We never leave, and we’re always just trapped in this house together. So I think the juxtaposition of these big issues being played with by very immature people, there’s always going to be a lot to mine there.\n\nThis episode delivers another reference to The Cutting Edge as Trevor wonders if Abby likes one of his favorite films. Was it fun using that as a test for their similarities, and why does it get referenced so often?\n\nJoe Port, one of our showrunners, is a big Cutting Edge fan and is not shy about leaving his mark, making his preferences very clear. So it’s been a really fun detail by Trevor. I think it’s always the specificity, right? I think for probably a lot of people who watched the show, they remember that era, and we’re all on the precipice of the internet, and then it’s just starting. So there’s a very big transitional period, and I think there’s a lot of nostalgia to be found. And Trevor, with all of his references, there’s something very comforting and grounding about the world as he remembers it.\n\nWill Trevor get closer to Pete (Richie Moriarty) following this experience? After all, there’s some overlap with their storylines as dads.\n\nI love Richie Moriarty. I kind of always felt like at the beginning of Season 1, Pete was kind of Trevor’s closest buddy, and a lot of that was because of the proximity with which they died. They would’ve understood a lot of the same culture. Pete would’ve been there for a lot of the seminal films and cultural moments when Trevor was a kid. So yeah, I remember feeling, in the beginning, “Oh, that’s my buddy.” And so yeah, if this brings ’em closer together and there’s more Trevor and Pete stuff, I’d love to do more of that.\n\nHas Trevor learned his lesson with technology after trying to tex Pinkus and accidentally telling Abby the truth about her parentage?\n\nNo, definitely not. What I thought was very fun about this is, he didn’t mean for what happened to happen, at least, not to the extent to which it happened. On some level, he was wrong. I get why he did it, and I get the feelings, but I also think it’s fun to see these characters as the very fallible people that they are in that moment. When you live such a limited existence like these ghosts do, I’m sure all you could think about is what it is that you want. So I get it.\n\nDespite losing out on Abby’s life having died, does Trevor see this as the best possible outcome for his daughter’s life, having had Pinkus as a dad?\n\nI don’t know that it’s the best-case scenario, though, you might be right. I didn’t quite play it that way, but I’m not sure I disagree. What I thought was interesting in the storytelling was a kind of acknowledgement, a realization that Pinkus turned out to be a much better father than Trevor would’ve been. I think the awareness of that came from how Abby responds to a remarkably difficult situation that Trevor puts her in. Abby is able to handle it. She’s the one who reaches out. So I think what was interesting to me in those moments was how I’m watching my daughter do something that I wouldn’t have been able to do. And so I know that she’s in better hands with this man than she would’ve been in my hands. And I think that’s a very beautiful realization.\n\nGhosts, Season 4, Thursdays, 8:30/7:30c, CBS"

            "content": "Stimulating either of a pair of crucial nerves that carry messages from the brain to several major organs could be an effective way to treat people with severe depression.\n\nAn international team of researchers conducted a clinical trial on 493 adults whose major depression hadn't previously responded to treatment. Participants were fitted with a device capable of stimulating one of their vagus nerves, which was then activated in half the group to transmit signals to areas of their brain that regulate moods.\n\nAssessments were carried out for roughly ten months, after which participants who received the stimulation treatment showed improvements in their depressive symptoms, in their quality of life, and in their ability to carry out the daily tasks of everyday life.\n\n\"On average, each patient had already tried 13 treatments that failed to help them before they enrolled in the trial, and they had spent more than half of their lives sick with depression,\" says Charles Conway, a professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St Louis.\n\n\"But despite that super-high level of sustained illness, we still see statistically significant, measurable improvements in depressive symptoms, quality of life and functional outcomes.\"\n\nWhile VNS has shown promise for treating depression before, evidence of its success hasn't always been clear cut, leaving treatment difficult to afford for many in the US on insurance cover.\n\nThere are some reasons to be cautious. Based on the study's primary measure of depressive symptoms, the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), there were no differences between the treatment and non-treatment groups.\n\nVery few participants from either group reported a full remission in their depression, and it's also worth noting the study was partly funded and supported by LivaNova USA, which manufactures a VNS therapy system for patients.\n\nEven with those caveats in mind though, the study's results are promising, particularly when it comes to helping people escape the mental paralysis that can come along with major depression.\n\n\"What's really important here is that patients themselves were reporting that their lives were improving,\" says Conway.\n\n\"They're saying they are seeing meaningful improvements in their ability to function and live their lives.\"\n\nUp to 30 percent of those with severe depression fail to benefit from standard antidepressants, with their mental health problems compounded by an increased risk of suicide, hospitalization, and disability.\n\nThe same clinical trial is being used to see if VNS can make a difference for people with bipolar too. In addition, the researchers want to continue the trial for another four years, and see if the benefits are particularly noticeable in certain groups of people.\n\n\"The nice thing about vagus nerve stimulation, we know from other studies, is that when the patient responds, the effects usually stick,\" says Conway.\n\nThe research has been published in two papers in Brain Stimulation, here and here.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in January 2025."

            "content": "When speech pathologist Vanessa Abraham began to feel ill in 2019, she thought she had a bad case of the flu. She was exhausted and her body ached. Her voice was raspy. She was prescribed antibiotics, but they didn't help.\n\nA week later, Abraham woke up in the middle of the night and tried to stand. She collapsed to the floor, struggling to breathe. Her husband took her to an area hospital, where Abraham was taken to the ICU and intubated. The ventilator helped her breathe but left her unable to speak.\n\nDoctors didn't know what was causing her symptoms. Two days after being admitted, she was transferred to UC San Diego Health, a larger hospital. That's where she met Dr. Jared Rosen, then a medical student on an ICU rotation.\n\nWhile Abraham was in the ICU, doctors suggested multiple diagnoses, but none fit. Even scarier than the lack of answers was her continued intubation. She was unable to speak or eat. She was fighting paralysis that left her unable to move much of her body. Her neck was so weak that she couldn't raise her head without it flopping like a newborn baby's, Rosen said.\n\nVanessa Abraham in the ICU. Vanessa Abraham\n\n\"I was very aware of what was going on,\" Abraham told CBS News. \"It was beyond the worst experience I could have ever imagined myself being in.\"\n\nAbraham said the only thing that helped relieve her anxiety during this time was the long hours Rosen would spend at her bedside, doing his best to keep her spirits up. As a medical student, he had fewer responsibilities than other members of her care team and was able to spend more time with Abraham. They also worked to develop communication methods Abraham could use.\n\nAfter several weeks, Abraham's symptoms began to improve. She was taken off the ventilator. After a month, she was released from the ICU. But doctors were still no closer to understanding what had caused her paralysis.\n\n\"There was no official label or term for what I was having. The fear of not knowing was terrifying,\" Abraham said.\n\nDiagnosing a rare form of an unusual condition\n\nAfter being discharged from the ICU, Abraham still had weakness that left her unable to lift her right arm and made eating difficult, so she spent time in inpatient physical therapy. Even after that, she needed outpatient follow-up, as well as more specialized care like swallowing and voice therapy. She battled severe anxiety and depression. At times, she felt so overwhelmed that she considered taking her own life.\n\nVanessa Abraham and her daughter as she recovers from her ICU stay. Vanessa Abraham\n\nOne night, she searched for Rosen online and found his email address. Abraham wrote and asked if he remembered her. When he responded and said that he did, it \"brought tears\" to her eyes and \"sparked some level of joy\" that helped her have hope.\n\nThat hope carried her through the next several months.\n\nFinally, four months after her symptoms began, Abraham was diagnosed with a form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological disorder where the fibers around the nerves deteriorate and cause paralysis. In most cases, the paralysis starts in the legs and works its way upwards, according to Dr. Kiril Kiprovski, a neurologist and director of the Division of Neuromuscular Medicine at NYU Langone. Abraham had contracted the condition's even rarer pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant, which attacks the muscles in the diaphragm and throat.\n\nThe variant is \"very difficult to diagnose,\" Kiprovski said. There's no one test to determine if a person has Guillain-Barré syndrome or any of its variants, so doctors rely on clinical presentations. But they may not be familiar with the condition, Kiprovski said, because of its rarity. One person per 78,000 is diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome annually, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Only about 3% of those patients are diagnosed with the pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant, researchers have found.\n\nPeople diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome or a variant of it tend to improve on their own, as Abraham did, Kiprovski said. Once Abraham was diagnosed, she was able to start receiving intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, where donor antibodies are given to a patient to strengthen their immune system.\n\n\"It takes time\"\n\nAbraham continued her slow recovery. Having a name for what was happening to her helped her accept the laborious process.\n\n\"I had to accept in my own head that this is going to be something that's just going to take time,\" Abraham said. \"And that's how neuro diseases work. It takes time for your body to regenerate and heal.\"\n\nVanessa Abraham. Vanessa Abraham\n\nSix years later, Abraham still has neuromuscular weakness, but can go about much more of her daily routine. She is back at work, where her voiceless experience in the ICU informs her interactions with patients whose speech has been compromised. She spends as much time as possible in the gym, working to strengthen her body. She also stayed in touch with Rosen, who is now finishing a fellowship in critical care medicine at the University of California's Davis Medical Center. He told CBS News that Abraham's case inspired him to study that area of medicine.\n\nAbraham's recovery hasn't just been physical. She started attending a support group for people who have trauma after time in the ICU. The experience has helped her recover from the fear of those weeks on a ventilator. She has worked to raise awareness for the benefits of such groups. She also wrote a memoir detailing her experience.\n\n\"There's so much more to recovery than just getting strong again,\" Abraham said."

Warming from climate change is making the pollen season longer, and more people are going to the doctor each year looking for relief, according to a recent research review published in the journal The Laryngoscope.\n\nOne study the reviewers looked at found the pollen season had already gotten 20 days longer in North America between 1990 and 2018, and several studies found an increase in average daily pollen concentrations.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLuckily, there are ways to keep the pollen from taking over your life. NPR asked doctors for tips to help you manage your spring allergies before they manage you.\n\nThis story comes from NPR's Health newsletter. Want more stories on the science of healthy living? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n1. Keep the outside outside\n\nPollen can be carried in on just about any surface, warns Dr. Zachary Rubin, a pediatric allergist and clinical immunologist who blogs about allergies and shares allergy-related tips on social media. Taking your shoes off when you enter your home is a good start, but there's more.\n\n\"Before you sit down on furniture or in your bed, you ideally should take off any clothes that would have been touching the outside world,\" Rubin says. Socks, pants, shirts all go directly in your laundry. Rubin also recommends taking a shower or a bath before bed to rinse pollen from your skin and hair.\n\nWhen indoors, Rubin recommends keeping your windows and doors closed as much as possible. That may be a bummer if you love a spring breeze, but you're inviting pollen and mold into your house when they're open, says Rubin.\n\nIf you're allergic to pollen, the stuff is more likely to float through windows on a dry and windy day. Rubin says rainy days are good for flushing it out of the air. But if you're allergic to mold, it's better to keep windows shut on rainy days too.\n\nIf you've just got to open those windows, Rubin says an indoor air purifier can provide some relief.\n\n2. Wipe down or bathe your pets\n\nIf you have a dog, cat or any pet who spends time outside, wipe the animal off whenever they come inside, says Rubin. You can pick up allergy-friendly wipes at pet stores. It's also worth giving pets more frequent baths to remove pollen, says Dr. Neelima Tummala, an ENT physician and clinical assistant professor in otolaryngology at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n3. Keep your nose clean\n\nFirst, look at when pollen counts are really high and try to avoid being outdoors during those times of day, advises Tummala. Right now we're in tree pollen season and that tends to be highest in the mornings, she says.\n\nWant to enjoy nature with fewer sneezes? It turns out the masks we got used to wearing to prevent COVID transmission \"can be very helpful actually,\" says Rubin, for keeping out pollen and mold. He points to research where health care workers during COVID reported reduced allergy symptoms when wearing masks.\n\nIt's also a good idea to rinse out your nose when you get home, says Rubin. You can do that with a neti pot or a saline spray. If you go the neti pot route, be sure to use distilled water, or tap water that's been boiled and cooled down, Rubin cautions. (Water straight from the tap comes with a small risk of infection from a brain-eating amoeba — eek!)\n\n4. Know your meds and when to use what\n\nDifferent allergy medications treat different symptoms. Here are a few common ones, and what to know about how to use them.\n\n\n\nOral and nasal antihistamines . If you're experiencing itchy eyes, a runny nose, or sneezing, an oral antihistamine like Zyrtec, Claritin, or Allegra should help, Rubin says. Astepro is a nasal spray with antihistamine, which Rubin usually recommends pairing with a steroid spray.\n\n\n\n. If you're experiencing itchy eyes, a runny nose, or sneezing, an oral antihistamine like Zyrtec, Claritin, or Allegra should help, Rubin says. Astepro is a nasal spray with antihistamine, which Rubin usually recommends pairing with a steroid spray. Steroid nasal sprays. If you've got congestion or postnasal drip, steroid nasal sprays like Flonase, Nasacort and Nasonex can help. But you probably shouldn't be taking them year-round, says Rubin. Check with your physician about how long to use them. These sprays take a few weeks to kick in, notes Tummala. With pollen season starting earlier, \"you may need to start your intranasal steroid spray earlier than you used to,\" so it'll be optimally effective.\n\n\n\nIf you've got congestion or postnasal drip, steroid nasal sprays like Flonase, Nasacort and Nasonex can help.

With pollen season starting earlier, \"you may need to start your intranasal steroid spray earlier than you used to,\" so it'll be optimally effective. Nasal decongestants. If you're really stuffed up and need instant relief, you can try a decongestant spray like Afrin or Vicks Sinex. These sprays shrink the blood vessels in your nasal passages. But Rubin warns not to use them for more than 3 to 5 days at a time, because you can develop a rebound nasal congestion that gets progressively worse. \"You almost become dependent upon it and it's hard to get rid of,\" he warns.\n\n5. Nasal spray the right way\n\nSponsor Message\n\nYou're probably doing it wrong. I know I was. \"A lot of people just naturally go, snort, spray, snort. What that does is it just shoots the medicine to the back of your throat where you taste it. And if you taste it, you waste it,\" Rubin says.\n\nHe demonstrated how to use nasal spray properly in a TikTok that went viral. Here's his secret to getting it right:\n\n\"I tell people 'nose to toes.' So you look down and then you place the nozzle up, but then you tilt it slightly towards the ear on the same side as your nostril. And after you spray on each side, you look forward and breathe through your mouth. Breathe normally, maybe a slight inhalation through your nose, but you never snort it,\" Rubin advises.\n\nWhy aim towards the ear? The ear is connected to the back of the throat and nasal cavity through the eustachian tube, so decreasing inflammation in that area will lower the risk of getting fluid behind your ear. Pointing the spray bottle towards the ear also targets openings between your nasal passages and your sinuses, lowering your risk of developing a sinus infection, says Rubin.\n\n6. Be aware of factors that can worsen your allergic reaction\n\nRubin uses a concept called the allergy symptom threshold to explain how exposure to multiple allergens, along with other factors, can trigger symptoms. \"You could be exposed to one pollen grain and not sneeze, but if you're exposed to a thousand, you're going to sneeze because there's enough there that will activate the immune system,\" he explains.\n\nThat goes for different kinds of allergens too. For instance, last week I was in Washington D.C., contending with pollen from the lovely cherry blossoms outside, and my sister's cat Felicia indoors. My sinuses were not pleased.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"It's like you have a cup and you're filling it with different allergens and exposures, says Rubin.\" (He illustrates the concept in another video.)\n\nOther factors can also increase your likelihood of having an allergic reaction. For some people Rubin says, drinking alcohol lowers the threshold, and some are more vulnerable when they exercise, particularly outdoors.\n\nIf you happen to be sick, \"your immune system is aggravated and hyperactive,\" Rubin says, and more likely to respond to allergens. (It can also work the other way around – if mucus builds up in your sinuses because of allergies, you're less able to fend off a respiratory infection that comes your way, he says.)\n\nIt goes back to reducing exposure, says Rubin: The more you can cut back your exposures to all kinds of allergens and irritants, the more successful you'll be at preventing an allergic reaction.\n\nNPR's Maria Godoy contributed to this report.\n\n"

It’s not uncommon for the person affected to accuse their mate of losing or misplacing items, making mistakes, causing confusion or forgetting things as a result of their disease.\n\nDementia (there are several types), a host of other medical conditions or perhaps a combination of medications could be the culprit behind this sudden change in personality and behavior. If this is the case, then it needs to be identified and addressed.\n\nThe first step is to have the family doctor do a full evaluation and refer to a specialist if needed. The spouse can schedule a private appointment with the doctor to give him a heads-up and see where it goes from there. A sudden and dramatic shift in personality or behavior, whether positive or negative, warrants a medical checkup (think brain tumors, too).\n\nI’ve seen this happen with loved ones dealing with metastatic cancer, dementia and prescription medications that, though taken as prescribed, became toxic and overloaded the body, leading to these kinds of effects. I wish “Help Me” the best. -- Been There\n\nDear Been There: Thank you for your letter.

            "content": "Mum upset by letter calling daughter, five, overweight\n\n1 day ago Share Save Catriona Aitken BBC News Share Save\n\nNatasha Willow, five, was categorised as being overweight following a health check at primary school\n\nA mum was left shocked and upset after her five-year-old daughter came home from school with a letter describing her as overweight. Natasha, from Blaenavon, Torfaen, was informed Willow was 3ft 8in (112cm) tall and weighed about three stone 7lb (22.6kg) - this meant she was slightly above the \"healthy weight\" category using the body mass index (BMI) system. Wales has a \"significant problem\" with childhood obesity, according to one expert, with more than 25% of children aged four to five overweight. The Welsh government said measuring the height and weight of reception children was important to help give them the best start in life.\n\nDespite the intentions, the categorisation shocked Natasha, as Willow takes part in gymnastics, dancing and swimming every week and has a balanced diet. \"I understand why they do it, to gather statistics for an overall population, but it's not accurate in the slightest,\" she said. \"It's such a demoralising approach, labelling children in such a manner, solely based on BMI. \"BMI is such an outdated approach, [providing] misleading information. There needs to be multiple factors that can represent a child's health, not just a tick-box exercise.\" BMI is a measure of whether someone is a healthy weight for their height. The NHS website states BMI scores have \"some limitations\" because the system measures whether a person is carrying too much weight, but not too much fat.\n\nNatasha Willow trains twice a week in gymnastics, as well as doing dance, swimming and performing arts\n\nNatasha, 29, wants the system overhauled, and has started a petition calling for it to \"take in the bigger picture\" of lifestyle and health. The healthcare support worker described being \"so disheartened\" by the letter seen by BBC Wales. It stated calculating children's weight categories could help parents make informed choices on lifestyles. The school had told her about health checks taking place last month, which would include eyesight and hearing assessments, as well as measurements. Natasha believed any results would take a \"holistic approach\", including questionnaires sent to parents. But the way it was done had left her worried about the \"negative psychological impact\" of the labels. \"I was angry and so upset,\" Natasha said. \"I've grown up being told I was overweight and I needed to lose weight, and I've done everything in my power to make sure Willow doesn't have any of that.\"\n\nWhy are children weighed at school?\n\nThe Child Measurement Scheme is Welsh government-led, and coordinated by Public Health Wales. It sees school nursing teams measure the height and weight of every reception pupil, unless their parents opt out. A letter is then sent to parents, explaining how they can see their child's results. At the end of the school year, the anonymised results are analysed for trends at local health board level and national levels. Public Health Wales said the information was used to \"plan services and inform changes to help families enjoy a healthy and active lifestyle\". In the letter Natasha received, it signposted parents towards its Every Child Wales initiative, for \"useful information on helping children stay fit and healthy\".\n\nNatasha Natasha says she was \"disheartened, angry and upset\" when she received the letter from her daughter Willow's school\n\nCardiff University's Prof Adrian Edwards, who is director of the Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre, said the country had a \"significant problem\" with childhood obesity. He added more than 25% of Welsh children aged four to five were overweight, compared to about 11% across the UK and 7% on average in other high-income countries. \"All the health problems we would recognise and understand - including mental health problems, arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer risk and all sorts of things - they are higher risk because of overweight and obesity, which starts in childhood,\" he said. He admitted some scientific research showed BMI was not always accurate. Prof Edwards cited the example of professional rugby players who can score as obese, \"but most of them are actually just full of muscle\". Another example, he said, was children's bodies changing as they grow. However, he emphasised the need for \"a balance to be struck between accuracy and consistency\". \"They've been doing the same thing over 20, 30 years,\" he said. \"So, leaving aside the nuances of who might or might not be being incorrectly categorised at the edges, I think it's telling us something about the mainstream, the typical picture. \"The question is what you do with this information. Is it about diagnosing an individual who should then have some extra attention and support? \"Or is it actually about understanding the problem at population level, perhaps without singling out individuals?\"\n\nCardiff University Prof Adrian Edwards says BMI checks serve the purpose of understanding \"the typical picture\" which has shown a \"significant problem\" of childhood obesity in Wales"

            "content": "Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes\n\nSARATOGA SPRINGS — Intermountain Health on Friday broke ground on the site of its new multispecialty clinic, which will include a dedicated cancer center, for residents of northern Utah County.\n\nThe Intermountain Saratoga Springs Multi-Specialty Clinic and Cancer Center plans to offer a wide range of specialized services, including OB/GYN care, gastroenterology care, audiology, urology, cardiology and pediatrics services, among others.\n\nThe cancer center within the clinic will provide comprehensive cancer care, such as chemotherapy treatments and support services. This will include survivorship services like oncology social work and oncology nurse navigators, who guide patients through the health care system and help manage expectations.\n\nThe new cancer center will join only two others in the county — located in American Fork and Provo — in hopes of easing the burden on patients who would otherwise need to regularly travel around 20 to 50 miles round trip to receive treatment.\n\n\"Intermountain has a very strong belief that cancer care should be delivered close to home,\" said Desiree Dougherty, assistant regional service line director for Intermountain Health. \"Carrying the burden of cancer ... is time consuming, creates stress, anxiety, time away from work, and they all have to spend hours in centers on days that they feel awful. The care is hard, and the treatments are difficult. So bringing cancer care close to home for these patients is incredibly important so they can have the care that they need with their families close to home.\"\n\nLaurie and Scott Stone felt the full weight of this burden when Laurie was diagnosed with uterine cancer in 2022. She went through extensive testing and was advised to have a hysterectomy. Following her procedure, doctors determined she would also need radiation therapy, which she received at the Intermountain cancer centers in American Fork and Provo.\n\nThis required frequent 25- or 50-mile trips, typically during heavy morning traffic. Two years after Laurie Stone's diagnosis, Scott received abnormal blood test results at his yearly physical and was also diagnosed with cancer. Laurie Stone has now completed treatment and anxiously awaits the five-year mark, where she will be declared cancer free, and Scott Stone is still undergoing treatment.\n\nThe pair were present at Friday's groundbreaking ceremony and expressed their deep gratitude and love for the medical staff in Intermountain's oncology network who have supported them over the years. While they will still need to travel for the remainder of Scott Stone's treatment, the couple is excited that these services will be available just 5 miles from their home.\n\n\"I'm so grateful for this center being here closer to home and that our community can take advantage of (it). Thank you very much,\" said Scott Stone, addressing Intermountain staff.\n\nThe multidisciplinary clinic aims to provide more services to northern Utah County because it is one of the fastest-growing areas in the state. Saratoga Springs is home to over 59,000 residents as of 2024, almost doubling its population since 2018. Eagle Mountain has around 64,000 residents and is projected to grow to nearly 80,000 by 2029.\n\n\"Our vision for this clinic is simple, which is that we want to bring the full strength of Intermountain cancer services into a space that feels local, personal and healing,\" said Brandon Barney, medical director of radiation oncology services. \"Patients here will have access to the same cutting edge technology that they would get in Salt Lake or at Utah Valley Hospital. That includes treatments with radiotherapy, with chemotherapy ... in-office procedures, radiation treatment planning. There's not really going to be a disease site or a type of cancer that we won't be able to treat here.\"\n\nThe clinic will be located at 392 W. Medical Drive in Saratoga Springs, between Intermountain Saratoga Springs Emergency Department and Surgery Center buildings and plans to open in fall 2026."

We worry about it leading to health issues, such as cardiovascular or gastrointestinal problems, but did you know that different foods and beverages can exacerbate anxiety spikes and even bouts of depression?\n\nIn fact, there are foods and drinks that therapists and psychiatrists, who have spent their careers advising people on mental wellness, typically avoid ― or consume in moderation ― for the sake of their mental health.\n\nTake this knowledge with a grain of salt. These foods and drinks can be consumed once in a while and not be correlated with negative mental health consequences. Just remember that, as with everything, moderation is key.\n\nMultiple Cups Of Coffee Or Espresso\n\nFor some people, too much caffeine can have a negative impact on anxiety. “If a person is prone to feeling anxious or has multiple stressors, know that over-caffeination causes an increased cortisol response and can lead to adrenal fatigue, a recipe for persistent stress and burnout, not to mention sleep issues,” said licensed clinical psychologist Brittney Jones.\n\nResearch suggests that consuming more than 250 milligrams of caffeine per day (that’s roughly 2 1/2 cups) could have a negative impact on anxiety, so Jones does her best to keep her coffee consumption under that amount. And for people who get jitters or anxiety spikes from coffee, consuming caffeine in the form of matcha can be a great alternative since it gives many people a feeling of calm alertness thanks to a compound called L-theanine.\n\nDiet Soda\n\nIf you’re looking out for your mental health this summer, you might want to keep your diet soda consumption to a minimum. “Everyone loves a cold diet soda on a warm summer day, but the health concerns outweigh the benefits,” said Jacques Jospitre, Jr., a board-certified psychiatrist and co-founder of SohoMD. “While we know high-sugar sodas aren’t great for our health, diet sodas might actually be even worse. Many of these contain phenylalanine, which is an added chemical well-known to mess up brain neurochemistry by stopping the proper production of serotonin and dopamine, two molecules we need for good mood.”\n\nAdditionally, these drinks have artificial sweeteners like aspartame, “which is a known neurotoxin and may raise stress hormones like cortisol, as well as increase the amount of free radicals in the brain,” Jospitre said.\n\nAlcohol\n\nWhile a drink or two once in a while isn’t the worst thing, Danielle Tucci, a licensed professional counselor and the founder of Live Better Therapy Solutions, said she does her best to avoid alcohol when considering her mental health."

            "description": "Discover how low-carb diets impact nutrient intake and the risk of deficiencies. Learn strategies for maintaining balanced nutrition effectively.",
            "content": "Key Takeaways Low-carb diets may lead to deficiencies of micronutrients like vitamin C, iron and magnesium.\n\nWhile supplements may help, you should consult a doctor or dietitian before starting them.\n\nEating diverse foods can help ensure you consume a healthy amount of vitamins and minerals.\n\nRates of obesity are rising, and it seems like more people are trying specialized diets, particularly those that cut back on carbohydrates. Currently, more than 40% of adults in the United States experience obesity, and while many aim to lose weight, keeping that weight off remains a significant challenge as obesity rates continue to grow.\n\nAccording to the International Food Information Council, 43% of people believe carbohydrates or sugars are the main cause of weight gain. But only 25% of folks see calories from all sources as contributing to weight gain. However, scientific studies suggest that cutting carbs doesn’t offer significant weight loss benefits when the total number of calories consumed is the same. And there are downsides to a low-carb diet, too—some research suggests that cutting back on carbohydrates can lead to inadequacies in key vitamins and minerals.\n\nTo shed more light on those concerns, a group of researchers analyzed data to help figure out if adults on low-carb diets are missing out on some macronutrients and, if so, which ones. They published their work, which also includes insights about how fat may affect macronutrient intake, in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nHow Was This Study Conducted?\n\nThis study relies on data collected as part of a large, ongoing health study called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is conducted by the Centers for Disease Control. These researchers focused on data from adults aged 20 years or older that was collected from 2007 to 2018, which resulted in just over 15,000 participants for the study. On average, the participants were 48 years old.\n\nParticipants in the study were divided into two main groups based on the percentage of calories they consumed from carbohydrates, which was determined based on food surveys that participants took. The first group included those with a carbohydrate intake of less than 45% of their total energy, referred to as the \"restricted carbohydrate\" group. The second group included those whose diets met established guidelines for carbohydrates (45% to 65% of energy), as well as for other nutrients like fats, protein and specific fatty acids.\n\nIntake of certain nutrients, like vitamins A, B12, C, D and E, as well as folate, iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc, were assessed to see how many people might not be getting enough when following the lower carb dietary pattern. They also checked how many people consume too much sodium. The research analyzed what people get from food alone and, for most nutrients, also included supplements.\n\nTo further understand the role of fats, the restricted carbohydrate group was split into smaller subgroups based on how much fat they consumed. These subgroups looked at total fat and the types of fat, such as monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fats to analyze intakes of certain nutrients. By analyzing these patterns, researchers aimed to identify connections between dietary intake and nutrient deficiencies across the population.\n\nWhat Did the Study Find?\n\nCompared to the group that followed the recommended dietary ranges, those in the low-carb group were slightly less likely to be women, more likely to have finished college, and had a higher income compared to their household needs. The low-carb group consumed fewer carbohydrates but more protein, more fat and more alcohol compared to the recommended group.\n\nPeople following a diet low in carbohydrates were more likely to have too little of certain minerals and vitamins compared to those who followed a balanced diet that met all recommended intake ranges.\n\nSpecifically, the low-carb group was more likely to be deficient in:\n\nIron\n\nMagnesium\n\nVitamin A\n\nFolate\n\nVitamin C\n\nVitamin D\n\nOn the brighter side, the low-carb group was less likely to be deficient in zinc and vitamin B12. Those on a lower carb diet were likely to consume more vitamin K and choline than recommended, but they also ate more sodium than recommended.\n\nWhen people following a low-carb diet were grouped by how much total fat they ate, further patterns emerged regarding their nutrient levels. For instance, those on a low-carb, low-fat diet were more likely to consume less calcium and vitamin E than recommended.\n\nAnd different types of fat were linked to different intakes of certain nutrients as well. For example, the research team investigated how monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) intake affected nutrient levels in people on low-carb diets. They found that a low-carb, low-MUFA diet often led to overconsumption of sodium and underconsumption of vitamin E, while a high-MUFA diet supported healthy potassium intake. MUFAs are found in foods like olive oil and avocado.\n\nResearchers also looked into similar relationships between some micronutrients and polyunsaturated fats and saturated fat, finding, for example, that a diet lower in saturated fat was more likely to support healthy calcium intake.\n\nThese findings suggest that the relationship between carbohydrate restriction and micronutrient inadequacy is dependent on the amount and type of fat intake, which has implications for clinical practice.\n\nIt’s important to note a few limitations when considering this data. The information about food intake came from self-reports, which can sometimes be inaccurate due to personal bias or errors in recall. Additionally, participants were grouped into the carb-restricted category regardless of whether they were intentionally following this type of diet or not. Lastly, everyone with a carbohydrate intake below 45% of their total energy was grouped together, but it’s possible that varying levels of carbohydrate restriction could lead to different outcomes.\n\nHow Does This Apply to Real Life?\n\nFor those considering a low-carbohydrate diet, these findings highlight some practical takeaways that can guide healthier choices. While reducing carbohydrates might seem like a straightforward way to manage weight, it’s essential to understand the potential trade-offs.\n\nCutting back on carbs without carefully planning your diet can lead to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals like magnesium, vitamin C and folate. These nutrients play vital roles in energy production, immune function and overall health, so it’s crucial to make adjustments to ensure you’re not missing out on them.\n\nSupplementation can be a useful strategy to address nutrient gaps, especially for individuals following more restrictive diet plans. But it’s important to remember that supplementation isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. Consulting with a healthcare provider or a dietitian ensures personalized advice tailored to your specific diet, lifestyle and health needs. They can help assess whether supplements are necessary and recommend the right dosage to complement your diet safely and effectively.\n\nA balanced approach to low-carb eating can make all the difference. Incorporating diverse food groups, such as leafy greens, nuts, seeds and lean proteins, can help mitigate the risk of nutrient deficiencies while still reaping the benefits of carbohydrate reduction. By paying attention to dietary quality and seeking professional input when needed, you can pursue your health goals while maintaining optimal nutrition and well-being.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA new study in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics highlights potential nutritional gaps among people who follow a low-carbohydrate diet. While many people turn to these diets to shed excess weight, it comes with potential downsides, including deficiencies in some vitamins, iron, magnesium and folate. Micronutrient deficiencies can compromise energy levels, immune support and long-term health outcomes. These risks emphasize the necessity of a well-structured diet (or even strategic supplementation) to avoid any nutritional gaps while following a low-carb lifestyle.\n\nUltimately, the takeaway is clear—diet quality matters just as much as diet quantity. For those choosing a low-carb approach, prioritizing nutrient-dense foods is essential to ensure proper health and functionality. This might mean incorporating foods like spinach, avocados, nuts, and berries, which can supply vital vitamins and minerals typically missing from low-carb meal plans. By making informed adjustments, consulting with health professionals and tailoring dietary choices to individual needs, those pursuing low-carb diets can achieve more sustainable and healthful outcomes.\n\n"

            "content": "Slate Plus members get more Care and Feeding every week. Have a question about kids, parenting, or family life? Submit it here!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI divorced my children’s dad for a “bad” reason in their minds, and they are so angry, and I’m not sure how to work through it with them. My kids are 18 and 20, and in college. In their narrative (and their dad’s), I filed for divorce the instant the youngest went to college because I hated their grandma and wanted her to die alone. To me, it’s more complicated. In 2023, my MIL moved in with us for emergency caregiving for Alzheimer’s. She and my husband weren’t close. He was a surprise youngest kid and she openly resented him for it in childhood, although she apologized a few years ago. It seemed like he was trying to make it up to her by taking her in. His older siblings suggested a nursing home, and offered to help arrange it. She could afford it, even. Instead, he moved her in without consulting me, and she needed a lot of help. She could be pretty mean even before the dementia removed her filter, so once that happened, things really deteriorated.\n\nAfter two years of burnout, anger, and exhaustion, I fell out of love. We had multiple conversations and even marriage counseling about the ways his unilateral decisions were hurting our marriage. The last straw was his refusal to the idea of a home health aide after she accidentally set a small fire and needed daytime supervision. Instead, he suggested I take FMLA (he’s already used his) or go part-time to stay home with her. I realized he wasn’t even trying to look out for his mom’s best interests, or mine.\n\nI filed for divorce, and he immediately told our kids that it was because I hated Grandma and didn’t want to care for others. It hit on a painful point for me and the kids; I was the primary earner with long hours for all of their middle school years because their dad was unemployed. I never got to spend as much time with them as I wanted, and I know they resent that. So to them, it feels like more of the same. What can I do to make room for their pain but not get excommunicated?\n\n—Miserable\n\nDear Miserable,\n\nYour reasons for leaving the marriage are quite fair; your husband refused to do what was best for his mother (out of a field of options that not everyone has) and instead, chose a situation, without your input, that was untenable for you. Of course, that doesn’t stop your kids from being hurt over the divorce, but you aren’t responsible for their pain. Your children are young adults; they’re old enough to handle the truth about why you split from their father. Be honest with them.\n\nTalk to them about what life was like with your MIL and their father’s refusal to get her the sort of help she needs. Acknowledge that the idea of you “refusing” to be around may be triggering because of their childhood experiences, but let them know you did everything within reason to make things work, until you simply couldn’t anymore. Be empathetic and let them know that you know the divorce hurts them; give them the space to express their grief while still standing up for yourself. It may take them some time to understand, but hopefully, they’ll come to respect the way you advocated for yourself.\n\n—Jamilah"

            "content": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A Texas doctor who has been treating children in a measles outbreak was shown on video with a measles rash on his face in a clinic a week before Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met him and praised him as an “extraordinary” healer.\n\nDr. Ben Edwards appeared in the video posted March 31 by the anti-vaccine group Kennedy once led, Children’s Health Defense. In it, Edwards appears wearing scrubs and talking with parents and children in a makeshift clinic he set up in Seminole, Texas, ground zero of the outbreak that has sickened hundreds of people and killed three, including two children.\n\nThis image from video posted on the Children’s Health Defense website on March 31, 2025, shows Dr. Ben Edwards with a measles rash on his face, while working in a makeshift clinic in Seminole, Texas.

Little mild fever. Spots came in the afternoon. Today, I woke up feeling good,” Edwards said in the video.\n\nMeasles is most contagious for about four days before and four days after the rash appears and is one of the world’s most contagious diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctors and public health experts said Edwards’ decision to go into the clinic put children, their parents and their community at risk because he could have spread it to others. They said there was no scenario in which Edwards’ conduct would be reasonable.\n\nKennedy met with Edwards about a week after the video was posted by Children’s Health Defense, the group Kennedy led for years until December. In an April 6 post on X, Kennedy said he “visited with these two extraordinary healers,” including Edwards and another doctor, and praised their use of two unproven treatments for measles.\n\nEven as measles has exploded in Texas and spread across the country, Kennedy, the nation’s top health official, has declined to consistently and forcefully encourage people to vaccinate their children and remind them that the vaccine is safe. Kennedy’s post drawing attention to Edwards is inappropriate but unsurprising given Kennedy’s record, said Dr. Craig Spencer, a medical doctor who is also a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

A spokesperson for Kennedy said he is not anti-vaccine and that he is “committed to improving children’s health in America and has re-deployed resources to Texas to help with the current outbreak.” He did not answer why the health secretary chose to meet with and praise Edwards rather than any of the other doctors in West Texas who have been treating children in the outbreak.\n\nEdwards told The Associated Press in an email that he “interacted with zero patients that were not already infected with measles” during the time he was infectious. “Therefore, obviously, there were no patients that were put in danger of acquiring measles since they already had measles.”\n\nBut Jessica Steier, a public health scientist, said the video shows Edwards in the room with people who do not appear sick, including parents of sick children and the people who visited the clinic from Children’s Health Defense. She also questioned what steps Edwards was taking to confirm people were sick with measles, rather than relying on guesswork.\n\nSteier, who runs the Science Literacy Lab and co-wrote an article about Edwards’ conduct, said while there may be some extraordinary emergencies where it would be appropriate for a sick doctor to work, this is not one of those situations because there is no shortage of providers who are not infected. She also pointed out that the video shows Edwards was not wearing a mask.\n\n“You have the HHS secretary lifting him up,” she said. “You know, it’s so, so dangerous. I really feel for the people who are on the ground.”\n\nChildren’s Health Defense has sued a number of news organizations, among them the AP, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.\n\nKennedy’s promotion of a doctor who has touted unproven measles treatments is “wholly irresponsible” but is in line with Kennedy’s long public record of anti-vaccine views, said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He said Kennedy has carried those views to his new job as the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n“He’s not the director of Children’s Health Defense anymore. He’s responsible for the health and well-being of children in this country,” Offit said. “It’s an emergency, but Kennedy is not treating it that way.”\n\n___"

            "content": "Amid a rising number of outbreaks, including a large one centered in West Texas, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in its weekly update reported 88 more measles cases, pushing the national total to 800.\n\nThe pace of activity in the first 4 months of the year is well on track to pass the 2019 total of 1,274 cases, which was the most since the United States officially eliminated the virus in 2000. In its update, the CDC said 94% of cases this year are part outbreaks, which have reached 10 now—3 more than the previous week.\n\nHalf of all US states have reported cases, some of which are linked to international travel. Among illnesses reported so far, 96% of patients were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. So far, 85 patients (11%) were hospitalized, with the number of deaths remaining at 3.\n\nTexas nears 600 infections\n\nIn the main outbreak hot spot, the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) today reported 36 more cases since April 15, boosting the state's total to 597, of which 371 are from Gaines County, though 24 other counties have also reported cases.\n\nIn its list of other measles cases, the TDSHS reported 15 case-patients from Upshur County in the eastern part of the state, 2 of whom are Upshur County residents. Officials are examining the residency status of the other patients to determine if the cases are linked to the West Texas outbreak.\n\nOutbreaks in New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma have also been linked to the West Texas outbreak. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment this week reported 5 more cases, bringing its total to 37 infections in eight counties.\n\nMichigan reports outbreak, Montana reports cases\n\nYesterday the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Mid-Michigan District Health Department reported the state's first measles outbreak since 2019, which involves three cases from Montcalm County in the western part of the state. Official added that the outbreak was initially linked to a large ongoing outbreak in Ontario, Canada.\n\nIn other outbreak developments, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services yesterday confirmed the state's first measles cases since 1990. Officials said they are investigating five cases, which include children and adults living in Gallatin County who were exposed to measles while traveling outside of the state.\n\nAll were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. Officials said the patients are isolating at home and that so far two potential public exposure sites in Belgrade and Bozeman have been identified."

            "description": "Disease trackers say it's unlikely the cases are connected, although definitive answers may be elusive.",
            "content": "Now, the Globe has learned the investigation is expanding. On Wednesday, an inspector from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health joined a staffer from the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration at the hospital to observe working conditions on the maternity floor. The state DPH is collaborating with OSHA, a federal agency that checks work sites for safety issues, the department said in a statement.\n\nSix recently reported cases of benign (noncancerous) brain tumors among nurses at Newton-Wellesley Hospital’s fifth-floor maternity unit have sparked uneasiness among workers there, even as hospital leaders insist that the facility is safe and that a rigorous ongoing investigation has uncovered no environmental risk.\n\nOn Friday , the state health department’s Division of Radiation Control Program planned to return to Newton-Wellesley to review information previously provided by the hospital and to perform some confirmatory measurements, the statement said.\n\nExposure of moderate-to-high doses of ionizing radiation, such as from medical imaging devices, has been linked to a higher risk for benign brain tumors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisease trackers said more scrutiny is needed by independent experts — individuals who are not affiliated with the hospital or the workers’ union there — to help resolve the issue in a manner all sides will trust. They caution that similar work-based situations have taken months to sort through, and even then, definitive answers are often elusive.\n\nFurther complicating the issue: the federal agency that typically is called in to investigate such matters, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, was recently gutted when two-thirds of its staff received layoff notices from the Trump administration, making a NIOSH investigation into the potential cause of the tumors unlikely in the near future. OSHA does not do the sort of disease-tracking investigation that would pinpoint a potential cause for brain tumors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Markman, spokesperson for the Massachusetts Nurses Association, which represents about 1,500 nurses at the hospital, said its members have a lot of questions.\n\n“We recognize that nurses and many other people want immediate information about the situation,” he said in a statement.\n\n“This urgency comes from a place of concern for the health of nurses, their families, and patients — an urgency that we share,\" Markman said.\n\nThe union in late March sent health questionnaires to its members at the hospital, asking them to share them with other workers as well as nurses who previously worked there. Markman said the union has received about 300 completed forms and its team of occupational safety and health nurses is poring through responses. They’re also seeking follow-up medical records to get a clearer picture of the potential scope of the issue.\n\nThe union does not have a timetable for when its investigation might be completed, but Markman said, “We are glad the hospital is continuing to look into this situation.”\n\nNewton-Wellesley Hospital administrators said they tapped outside environmental experts to help with a wide-ranging investigation that scrutinized water and air quality, as well as radiation levels and cleaning chemicals that workers on the fifth floor may have been exposed to. And, they said, they are continuing to work with state and federal investigators. Newton-Wellesley is part of the Mass General Brigham health system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Our rigorous investigation has not identified any environmental trigger at Newton-Wellesley Hospital that causes brain tumors,” the hospital said in a statement. “We remain confident that our environment is safe for staff, clinicians, and patients.”\n\nSix current and former staffers from the fifth floor maternity unit have reported to hospital administrators that they were diagnosed with benign brain tumors in recent years, hospital officials said.\n\nAmong those workers is a nurse who worked there 23 years ago and was diagnosed in 2021. Details about the other brain tumor cases have not been released by the hospital, except that the benign tumors are of three different types, and the individuals included some who worked there only part time.\n\nAt least six other workers from the fifth floor also reported other health problems, hospital officials said.\n\nAbout 1 million Americans are living with a brain tumor, according to the National Brain Tumor Society. Nearly three-quarters of such tumors are benign. The majority of people with brain tumors are women, the society notes, and the median age for a diagnosis is 61, which describes the typical gender and age of nurses in Newton-Wellesley’s maternal unit.\n\n“Without additional information, no conclusion can be reached: if it is due to chance, or some potential work-related exposure,” said Tongzhang Zheng, an epidemiology professor in the Brown School of Public Health, who is not involved in the Newton-Wellesley investigation.\n\nHe said these types of cases are usually deemed to be unrelated, after a neutral third-party reviews all the potential physical and chemical cancer-causing substances that a distinct group of workers was exposed to over a specific period of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Although a few chemicals (such as benzene, vinyl chloride, formaldehyde, and bisphenol A) have been linked to brain tumor risks, the association for most of them is still uncertain,” he said.\n\nThirty years ago, an investigation by NIOSH at Brigham and Women’s Hospital concluded that “major ventilation system deficiencies” could have contributed to poor indoor air quality that was linked to respiratory and related health problems among nurses. But the investigators noted that by the time they arrived, several years after other reports failed to settle on a single source for the ailments, the hospital had already started to fix the ventilation system, which complicated the investigators’ findings.\n\nIdentifying the scores of workers who may have cycled in and out of Newton-Wellesley’s fifth-floor maternity unit over a decade or longer, but who may also have worked at other facilities in the intervening time, would be challenging, said Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard professor who consults and advises public health organizations.\n\n“It could be a [physical or chemical] exposure that happened there years ago . . . and now that exposure is gone, and that’s why these things are often hard to pin down,” he said. “And was there an overlap when all of these nurses were all there?”\n\nWhile acknowledging the challenge such investigations face, Mina said hospital administrators erred in declaring the hospital risk-free while tests are still ongoing.\n\n“I would want to take a more cautions approach, saying, ‘We don’t know, but everything we have found today suggests there is not an ongoing risk.’ ”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay Lazar can be reached at kay.lazar@globe.com Follow her @GlobeKayLazar."

            "content": "There are so many factors that can influence how we perceive others, which in turn can determine the people we choose as platonic friends or romantic mates. We certainly make snap judgments based on physical appearance, but scent can have a powerful influence, too. According to a new paper published in the journal Scientific Reports, two heterosexual women meeting for the first time rely partly on scent to judge whether they want to be friends with each other, deciding within minutes—practically at first whiff—whether there is friendship potential.\n\nSocial olfactory research largely stems from evolutionary psychology, specifically the work of Swiss biologist Claus Wedekind in 1995. Subtle chemical signals from pheromones are known to play a role in attraction in many species. Scientists had already found evidence in fish and mice that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, which are critical for immune system function (and useful in determining tissue compatibility for transplants, for instance)—showed a marked preference for sexual partners with different MHC genes, perhaps as a way of keeping the gene pool well-mixed and protecting against inbreeding.\n\nWedekind introduced the so-called \"sweaty T-shirt\" method to study the possible role of MHC in mate preferences in humans. Male participants wore the same T-shirt for two days, which were then placed in identical boxes. Women participants then smelled each shirt and indicated which ones they found most sexually attractive. Wedekind found that the women overwhelmingly preferred the T-shirt smells of men who had the most dissimilar MHCs to their own. The only caveat: The preference was reversed in women who were taking oral birth control.\n\nThere have been many other smelly T-shirt studies since Wedekind published his findings, even inspiring the trend of \"pheromone parties\" for amorously inclined singles. The psychologists who authored this latest paper were more interested in studying the role of olfactory cues in platonic friendships. Smelly T-shirt studies often try to isolate a person's \"natural\" odor, devoid of scents from toiletries, pets, and other environmental factors. The Cornell team focused on so-called \"diplomatic\" odor, which incorporates all those other factors.\n\nWhy can’t we be friends?\n\n“It’s not just perfume,” said co-author Jessica Gaby of Middle Tennessee State University. “It’s your dietary choices. Are you a cat person or dog person? What laundry detergent do you use? All these judgments come together into what we call ‘diplomatic odor.’ You live in this odor space–does it match with the odor spaces of the people you interact with?”"

            "content": "The International Space Station (ISS) has been orbiting Earth since 1998, housing groups of astronauts in the microgravity environment around 250 miles above the surface of the planet. All of that time in space has taken a toll on its aging hardware, and the space station is due to retire within the next few years. Until then, however, safety experts are warning of long-running issues that threaten the safety of the ISS, and the crew on board.\n\nDuring a meeting of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) held on Thursday, members of a NASA safety panel stated that there are growing risks threatening the space station as it nears the end of its use, SpaceNews reported. “The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence,” Rich Williams, a member of the panel, said during the meeting.\n\nAt the top of the list of growing risks is a leak where air has been escaping at an increasing rate from a tunnel that connects a docking port to a Russian module. In 2019, Russia’s space agency Roscosmos reported the detection of an air leak found in the vestibule (named PrK) that connects a docking port to the Russian Zvezda module, which the space agency had launched to low Earth orbit in July 2000. The rate of air that has been leaking from Russia’s Zvezda module had doubled from one pound of air per day in 2019 to a little over two pounds around a week before the launch of the Progress MS-26 cargo spacecraft in February 2024.\n\nBoth NASA and Roscosmos have been monitoring the air leak since then, and officials from the two space agencies are scheduled to meet later this month to update mitigation efforts for the growing safety concern, according to Williams. A report issued in late 2024 elevated the air leak to the highest level of risk based on its likelihood and severity. In the meantime, the source of the leak remains unknown. The astronauts on board the ISS are prepared to close the hatch to the service module when access is not required in order to minimize the amount of air lost, as well as to isolate the leak itself from the rest of the space station.\n\nAnother safety issue addressed during the meeting is the lack of a deorbit plan for the ISS in case of an emergency. NASA is in the process of solidifying a plan to ditch the nearly one-million pound space station in 2030, sending it flying through Earth’s atmosphere to mostly burn up from the heat, with its remaining bits ending up at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in a controlled reentry. But as of now, NASA has no emergency plan in place to deorbit the ISS, and that’s a big problem. If NASA is forced to destroy the space station ahead of its retirement, then it increases the risk of ISS debris falling on inhabited areas.\n\n“If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the [U.S. Deorbit Vehicle] is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude,” Williams said, according to SpaceNews. The panel highlighted other issues with the ISS, including having enough spare parts for life support systems on board and delays with cargo deliveries. Williams blamed these issues on “ISS budget shortfall.”\n\n“As programs near final phases, it is tempting to assume less resources will need to be available,” Williams said. “For the ISS, it is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle is safely reentered.”"

            "content": "Consuming too much cooking oil could increase your chances of cancer, a study from Weill Cornell Medicine found.\n\nThe study was published on March 14 in Science, after researchers noticed that linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid found in vegetable and seed oils, can enhance an aggressive subtype of breast cancer called triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).\n\nTNBC, known for its rapid growth and spread, has limited treatment options. It is more common in women under the age of 40 and accounts for 10% to 15% of all breast cancers, with a 77% survival rate according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nLinoleic acid is deemed essential for mammals, playing crucial roles in supporting inflammation regulation, skin health and cell membrane structure, according to an article from The Conversation. However, since the 1950s, people have been eating too much of this fat when using seed oils in fried and ultra-processed foods.\n\nDr. John Blenis, the study’s senior author and a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell, told The New York Post that “the findings do not warrant blanket avoidance of seed oils, but suggest moderation and selectivity, especially for high-risk individuals.”\n\nLinoleic acid can be found in seed oils made of canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, soy, sunflower, safflower and rice.\n\nThese oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids but lower in omega-3s. This imbalance can lead to inflammation in the body, The Post explained.\n\nTherefore, the best way to stay healthy, Blenis explained in the New York Post article, is to have “a balanced, whole-food diet” because it’s considered “an important cornerstone of cancer prevention” and is “a strategy everyone can adopt.”\n\n12aa"

            "description": "The authors of a new book explain why understanding the science of stress can help us manage it better",
            "content": "It’s all in the mind\n\nTrue (up to a point)\n\nThe way stress manifests is very much bodily, centred around hormones such as cortisol and their effect on us. But this process is triggered by the brain (notably the amygdala and the hypothalamus) and the way our brains react to stress is often set in early childhood, even in the womb. Pregnant women who experience extreme stress can give birth to infants who react more strongly to stress hormones – with increasing evidence suggesting that this causes modifications to the baby’s DNA. Self-actualising your way out of stress is difficult – not least because the causes might be serious and inescapable – but not always impossible. Some studies have shown that if you tell people they are the sort of person who doesn’t feel stress, they experience fewer symptoms. One US study found that teenagers growing up with worries about violent crime in a deprived part of Chicago tended to fare better if they simply tried to not think about it.\n\nIt is always bad for you\n\nFalse\n\nStress is central to the human existence, and its most obvious and visceral manifestation – our fight-or-flight response to immediate threat – has evolved to protect us from danger. There is also evidence that it can help us concentrate. A study of video game players taking part in a tournament found that those who showed barely any rise in cortisol levels fared the worst, and those with the highest increase performed moderately. Winners tended to have some extra cortisol, but not too much. This hormonal and psychological balancing act is different for everyone, so gauging the “right” amount of stress is difficult. But as a broad guide, stress is less likely to be harmful if it is predictable, and particularly if it is voluntary. Studies have shown that conducting an orchestra makes the body show multiple signs of apparent stress. But this is the stress of exhilaration, which is less likely to cause ill effects.\n\nIt’s the preserve of male business executives\n\nFalse\n\nFor decades the study of stress was based entirely around men, and often centred on the better-off. The breakthrough came with a pioneering Swedish study which found that people who had high demands on their time but little control over their lives tended to be the most stressed. Subsequent research has shown how unavoidable demands, whether through caring responsibilities or having multiple jobs, are especially stressful. These findings are central to much of the understanding about modern stress, particularly that connected to work. Sir Michael Marmot, the pioneering researcher into health inequalities, has argued that jobs like those in an Amazon-type warehouse, where the pace is relentless and every movement is tracked, are “as if we took everything we knew about psychosocial work hazards, put it in a syringe and injected people with it”.\n\nIt’s a new worry\n\nFalse\n\nMuch of our modern understanding of stress is based on experiments with laboratory rats carried out in the 1930s by Hans Selye, an Austrian–Hungarian doctor and researcher who discovered that repeated and chronic triggering of the body’s hormonal alarm system can harm health. But even the Victorians worried that innovations like rail travel and the telegraph were too much for humans to deal with. George Miller Beard, the highly creative populariser of the disorder he called neurasthenia, used his evocatively titled 1881 book, American Nervousness, to blame stress on everything from science to civil liberties and “the phenomenal beauty of the American girl of the highest type”. Is modern stress any worse? It is certainly different. Compared to a Victorian, a 21st-century Briton has a state-provided safety net, decades’ more life expectancy and a child mortality rate about 60 times lower. There is, however, much focus on whether information overload from things like phones is a new type of stress. It is a reasonable concern, particularly for children – but it’s far from new. The term “information overload” was coined by Alvin Toffler, a US author whose bestselling book Future Shock argued that the pace of change in society caused by things like modern technology was simply too much for people’s brains – in 1970.\n\nIt’s mainly caused by big worries\n\nMainly false\n\nIn his 1972 poem The Shoelace, Charles Bukowski noted that while humans can generally cope with major upheavals, what eventually proves too much is the “continuing series of small tragedies” – everything from the “shoelace that snaps with no time left” to an unexpected bill. He was right; repeated studies have shown that stress tends to affect people most when it is chronic. But it’s also important to note that the scale of a worry is relative. What qualifies as a “minor” stress is entirely personal and subjective, and dependent on everything from personal circumstances and background to income – a single larger-than-expected bill can be catastrophic if you’re poor. There are some ways that stress, or at least its effects, can be mitigated. But don’t let anyone tell you that a particular cause of stress is minor. That is entirely a matter for you and your body.\n\nExercise always helps\n\nFalse\n\nThere are endless studies showing that physical activity can alleviate stress symptoms. But other research has shown that very high-intensity exercise can worsen matters. One study put volunteers through either a gruelling mock job interview process or a physical test using a stationary bike. While post-test questionnaires showed those in the latter group perceived themselves to be less stressed, their cortisol levels were higher, and stayed so for hours after. Cortisol itself is not a problem for the body. It plays a central role in maintaining things like blood glucose levels, and also acts as a hormonal alarm clock, rising gradually during the night to a morning peak to help get us out of bed. The problem comes with the chronic triggering of the body’s stress response. So, how to avoid this with exercise? One tip is to make sure it doesn’t feel like a chore – research has shown this can be particularly stressful. Another is to see if less intensive exercise, perhaps even something like yoga, helps. But as ever, there are no firm rules. Everyone is different.\n\nYou lose weight when stressed\n\nTrue and false\n\nSome people lose weight under chronic stress. But around two-thirds of people are more likely to put it on. There are two different factors at work, and one is hormonal. Studies have linked consistently high levels of hormones like cortisol with a propensity to store fat around the stomach. Also, research has consistently shown that stress tends to push people towards less healthy eating choices. There is an entire sub-genre of studies in which volunteers are placed under artificial stress, presented with a table of various foods, and told to snack as they please. Each time, those exposed to stress gravitate towards fatty, sweet or salty choices, and eat more overall than the control group who were not stressed.\n\nAnimals also feel stress\n\nTrue\n\nThe same fight-or-flight hormonal alarm system exists in mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles. And this is not just about existential threats. Studies of baboons have shown that lower‑ranked animals in a troop display higher levels of stress hormones. But what is unique about humans is the idea of chronic anticipatory stress. As Robert Sapolsky, a US biologist who spent two decades studying Kenyan baboons, once joked: “It is startling to realise that a vast length of time ago, while evading a predator or pursuing a prey, a dinosaur secreted glucocorticoids … [But] no dinosaur ever worried itself sick from perseverating on the absurd idea that an asteroid might strike Earth.” For humans, anticipatory stress serves a purpose. For example, if you were blithely unworried about taking an exam, your study regime might be a bit relaxed. Simply telling people not to worry about future events is pointless, and you should never feel guilty about worrying.\n\nIt’s your fault you’re stressed\n\nVery, very false\n\nThere are two immediate and very obvious reasons why this is wrong. Stress is often imposed by inescapable external factors, and people’s bodily response to it can often be exacerbated by their backgrounds, notably their childhood and infancy. But there is more to it: stress acts in such a way as to make it even harder to escape the circumstances which cause it, like poverty. One US study found that when poorer people were asked to think about an entirely hypothetical car repair bill, they performed less well in a subsequent cognitive test. Other studies have quantified this effect variously as being about the same as losing an entire night of sleep or shedding close to 15 IQ points. This is not a minor impact.\n\nThere’s nothing you can do about it\n\nTrue (and yet not)\n\nThis is correct in the sense that stress can often be imposed by your life circumstances and the preset way your body reacts. But the physical manifestations of stress are more possible to address. For example, while chronic stress can make you more likely to develop metabolic ailments such as type 2 diabetes, being more physically active can reduce this risk again. Some diets can have a similar effect, with studies showing that ones including a lot of green vegetables and foods rich in polyphenols, known for their anti-inflammatory properties, can reduce cortisol levels. Psychotherapy can also help with our in-built responses to stress. And research has shown the stress-reducing benefits of everything from more sleep and better-quality social relations to certain music, aromas and, at least in the short term, simple human touch. What works for one person might not for another, but one of the curiosities of stress is that its very slipperiness, the way it presents such a broad front in its impact on humans, also gives lots of ingress points when fighting back.\n\nStress Tested: How the New Science of Stress Hormones Can Transform Your Health by Dr Richard Mackenzie and Peter Walker is published on 24 April (Bluebird, £22).

            "content": "As the global population ages, more of us face frightening cognitive decline, personally or in our loved ones. There are over 10 million new cases of dementia globally each year.\n\nBut a study published last year suggests up to 13 percent of people diagnosed with dementia in the US may have a misdiagnosis and are instead left struggling with a condition that can be treated.\n\n\"Health care providers [must be] made aware of this potential overlap between dementia and hepatic encephalopathy, which is treatable,\" said Virginia Commonwealth University hepatologist Jasmohan Bajaj in July 2024.\n\nHepatic encephalopathy – cognitive impairment caused by liver failure – impacts more than 40 percent of patients with advanced liver disease (cirrhosis). The brain impairments it causes are hard to distinguish from dementia.\n\nOur livers regulate the levels of most chemicals in our bodies, from filtering them from the blood to aiding with digestion.\n\nAside from the well-known liver-damaging effects of alcohol, other risks to the liver include the hepatitis virus, high cholesterol, obesity and diabetes, stress, and aging. But if caught early enough and with the right treatment, damage to our livers can be reversed.\n\nMuch of this can be mitigated through changes in diet and behavior, and there are even more potential drug treatments on the horizon as well.\n\nIn fact, treatment of hepatic encephalopathy has resolved cognitive impairments in at least two patients who had been diagnosed with dementia.\n\n\"He is a different person!\" the wife of one of the patients notes, after his memory loss, falls, tremors, and hallucinations were all resolved.\n\nA recent study in mice suggests that even the impacts of aging on the liver may be reversible if caught early enough.\n\n\"We've shown that aging exacerbates non-alcoholic liver disease… and by reducing this impact, we can reverse the damage,\" explained Duke University hepatologist Anna Mae. \"You are never too old to get better.\"\n\nIn an earlier 2024 study, Bajaj and colleagues reviewed the medical records of 177,422 US veterans diagnosed with dementia between 2009 and 2019.\n\nNone of them had been diagnosed with liver disease, but the team found over 10 percent had high fibrosis 4 (FIB-4) scores, an index to measure liver scarring, meaning they were very likely to have cirrhosis.\n\nIn the new study, Virginia Commonwealth University biostatistician Scott Silvey, Bajaj, and colleagues repeated this review with 68,807 medical records of patients from a national database who aren't veterans, to see if their earlier results reflected the general US population.\n\nTo their surprise, even more patients with high FIB-4 scores were found in this population – almost 13 percent.\n\n\"The prevalences and determinants of a high FIB-4 are striking, including a greater proportion of patients who were not white in the high FIB-4 group,\" explain Silvey and team.\n\n\"While we did not study the specific factors behind these disparities, a lack of access to therapy or medical care in both dementia care and comorbidity care could contribute.\"\n\nOnce our livers start to malfunction, it stresses other tissues in our bodies, including kidneys, pancreas, and heart, as well as our brains. So it makes sense to prioritize our liver health.\n\n\"This important link between dementia and liver health emphasizes the importance of screening patients for potentially treatable contributors to cognitive decline,\" said Bajaj.\n\nThis research was published in The American Journal of Medicine.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was first published in July 2024."

            "content": "Recent research points to protein-rich food choices as powerful drivers of health. Many people are now asking whether a meat-heavy approach to protein is truly the best strategy when it comes to living longer.\n\nThe recent findings show that countries with higher levels of animal-based protein see lower mortality rates among children under five, yet plant-based protein is linked with longer lifespans for adults.\n\nThe study was conducted out by PhD candidate Caitlin Andrews and her team, led by Dr. Alistair Senior at the University of Sydney.\n\nFrom plants to meat protein\n\nPopulations worldwide seem to be trading vegetables for meat. Researchers have observed that animal-based protein consumption has climbed across various regions over the past several decades. More societies are gravitating toward protein-dense foods derived from cattle, poultry, and pigs.\n\nThese shifts are not uniform, though. In several corners of the globe, chickpeas, beans, and other legumes are still mainstays, along with certain dairy and egg products. In resource-constrained nations, individuals often rely on whatever is the most affordable form of protein.\n\nMeat protein lowers child death rates\n\n“For the under-fives, a food system that supplies large amounts of animal-based proteins and fats lowered rates of infant mortality,” said Andrews.\n\nIn places where young children miss out on ample nutrition, extra amounts of animal-based protein can be tied to better early survival rates.\n\nOne explanation involves the nutrients found in eggs, dairy, and meat. These foods contain essential amino acids, iron, zinc, and vitamins that help children grow. They also provide energy-dense fat, which supports early development.\n\nFamilies who live in impoverished settings, however, often struggle to access such staples.\n\nPlant protein helps adults live longer\n\n“For adults, plant-based proteins increased overall life expectancy,” said Andrews.\n\nHigher plant-based protein intake appears to bring key advantages. Diets built around legumes, peas, lentils, and nuts are linked with fewer chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease.\n\nAdults who rely on beans, lentils, or tofu may also get more dietary fiber. That fiber supports normal digestion and can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, too much red or processed meat is often linked with harmful effects that might shorten lifespan.\n\nGood fats early, less later\n\nAnother interesting aspect involves fat. Research suggests that in infancy and early childhood, certain animal fats might help reduce malnutrition.\n\nLater in life, though, cutting back on high-fat products can aid weight management, possibly easing issues like type 2 diabetes and hypertension.\n\nFoods loaded with saturated fat may disrupt the balance if combined with processed sugars and a sedentary lifestyle. Such combinations might trigger an inflammatory state and higher vulnerability to illnesses.\n\nThis pattern emphasizes how dietary composition can be more important than any single nutrient.\n\nA higher cost for the planet\n\n“Protein is a crucial part of the human diet, but as eating habits change and developed countries look to decarbonize, where we get our protein from has come under greater scrutiny,” noted the research team.\n\nMeat production draws attention for environmental reasons. Livestock farming typically requires more land and water compared to growing legumes or grains.\n\nThose aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions often look to pea or chickpea farming as lower-impact methods. This is sparking interest in alternative proteins, such as plant-based meat.\n\nBut these shifts need to be carefully approached, given how vital animal-sourced protein appears to be for child development.\n\nShifting protein needs\n\nWhat each person puts on the plate can differ by budget and culture. For families with small children, variety may be the safest bet. Adults seeking to improve their longevity might gain from swapping out meat for beans, peas, or other plant-based sources.\n\nSome individuals find plant protein more economical, while others view meat as a valued tradition. Experts advise that local resources and medical concerns shape the ideal balance.\n\nThe best approach might be a mixed plan, adjusting as people move from childhood into later stages of life.\n\nRethinking protein for global well-being\n\nThese results highlight a pattern: keep an eye on total protein intake first, then prioritize more plant-based sources past childhood.\n\nFuture innovations may focus on improving vegetarian options for children at risk of malnutrition. Researchers also stress the need for more accessible programs, especially in areas with low food security.\n\nShifting the global menu can pose challenges. It involves policy support, agricultural reforms, and nutrition education. The end goal is to see infants thrive and older people enjoy extra years, while also safeguarding natural resources.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Communications.\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways\n\nYou always ask for extra ketchup for your fries, douse your hot dogs in mustard and won’t go near raw broccoli unless there’s a bottle of ranch involved. We get it: You love condiments. So what if we told you they’re getting a healthy rebrand?\n\nTake Smash Kitchen, the sauce brand cofounded by actor Glen Powell, which promises “clean condiments” (ketchup, mayo, barbecue sauce and Dijon mustard) made with organic ingredients and no artificial colors or dyes. Or She’s the Sauce, a soon-to-launch condiments company serving up “sauce, with benefits” — by which they mean added protein and fiber, which the brand claims make its offerings better for anyone diagnosed with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) or using GLP-1s. They’re launching with creamy ranch and honey mustard this summer.\n\n“We’re including ingredients like ultra-filtered whey protein isolate, organic prebiotic inulin fiber for gut health and satiety and real spices you can actually pronounce,” She’s the Sauce founder Nicole Glabman shares in a statement to Yahoo Life. “We’re excluding inflammatory oils, refined sugars, gluten and fillers that often cause bloating or digestive discomfort.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe new wave of allegedly better-for-you condiments promises that flavor lovers can elevate their meals — as the brand She’s the Sauce puts it — “without guilt.” But does that mean adding ketchup on your eggs or squeezing honey mustard on a sandwich is something to feel guilty about in the first place? Here’s what dietitians say you should keep in mind.\n\nThe pros and cons of condiments\n\nDietitian Nina Crowley tells Yahoo Life that “condiments and sauces can be the anchor of flavor for a meal” and encourage you to eat things you might not otherwise — which is especially great if you're more inclined to eat, say, plain chicken breast if it’s dipped in mustard or barbecue sauce or veggies when they’re served up with a dip or dressing. By making healthy whole foods more exciting and flavorful, we’re less likely to reach for ultra-processed options with little nutritional value, like a candy bar or bag of potato chips.\n\nBut on the flip side, there’s little nutritional value in condiments. Most traditional condiments don’t contain much, if any, fiber or protein and are also limited in terms of the vitamins and minerals they provide. This means that while they’re adding calories to your meal, they’re doing little in terms of keeping you full for longer, even if the flavors make the food more exciting.\n\nMarissa Karp, a registered dietitian and founder of MPM Nutrition, tells Yahoo Life that many common condiments contain “hidden ingredients” — such as added sugars, unhealthy fats and artificial food dyes — that may “contribute to inflammation.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnother concern is sodium, dietitian Kara Siedman tells Yahoo Life. Excess sodium in one’s diet can lead to high blood pressure, increasing the risk of heart disease. A 1-tablespoon serving of Heinz ketchup, for example, has 160 mg of sodium. The recommended daily sodium intake is less than 2,300 mg for most adults.\n\nIn general, the serving size for condiments tends to be small — so you may underestimate the amount you’re putting on your food, leading to excess sugar and sodium intake.\n\nA healthier choice\n\nDifferent condiment brands come with a range of health claims. For Smash Kitchen, that means eschewing any artificial ingredients in favor of “organic” ones. Smash Kitchen’s ketchup has the same sugar content (4 grams) and calorie count (20 calories per serving) as Heinz’s version. The big difference is in the ingredient list: Heinz ketchup is made with high fructose corn syrup, while Smash Kitchen’s is made with organic cane sugar. While there have been some studies linking high-fructose corn syrup to poor health outcomes, the jury is still out on whether it’s actually any worse for you than cane sugar.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Heinz has a no-sugar-added ketchup sweetened with stevia as well as a “simply tomato” version with no artificial sweeteners and a no-salt-added ketchup made with salt substitute potassium chloride. (There's some debate as to whether these versions taste as good as the original Heinz; some say yes and others say no.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHealthier condiments may be more about what they’re taking out than whaat they're putting in, but She’s the Sauce is doing the opposite: infusing their sauces with extra protein and fiber while also limiting artificial ingredients. While She’s the Sauce has yet to release their upcoming products’ nutrition facts, Siedman tells Yahoo Life that adding protein and fiber can “support blood sugar optimization,” which “supports metabolic health.”\n\nIf you’re picking up a fat-based condiment like mayo or creamy ranch, Karp also recommends scanning the ingredient list for the types of fats used. Rather than sauces made with “processed vegetable oils or trans fats,” she prefers avocado and olive oil, which are “rich in monounsaturated fats,” meaning they can help reduce bad cholesterol levels and support overall cardiovascular health.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIs it worth it to go out of your way to pick up one of these healthier versions of condiments, especially if you’re already loyal to a particular brand? Crowley says that whether you should seek out a healthy condiment swap depends mostly on how much you like to use condiments.\n\n“From a big picture perspective, a small squirt of regular ketchup or barbecue sauce isn’t likely to derail your health goals,” she says. But if you are constantly giving your meals a generous pour, a lower sodium or sugar option or something with a boost of protein or fiber could be a smart choice.\n\nYou can also seek out condiments that are generally lower calorie, Siedman suggests. Mustard has anti-inflammatory properties, no sugar or fat and very few calories, as it’s made with low-calorie vinegar. Maybe it’s time for a burger makeover?"

That means following the instructions on the label and the advice of a health care provider.\n\n\"But that's not how we take these medications in real life,\" says Trisha Pasricha, a physician and instructor at Harvard Medical School. Some people take too much pain medication too quickly, misdiagnose an ailment and take the wrong drug, or unknowingly take multiple pain relievers at the same time.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOne study published in 2018, for example, found that 15% of over 1,300 survey participants exceeded daily NSAID dosages, and most participants didn't recognize that all the products they were taking were NSAIDs.\n\nThese behaviors can lead to serious side effects, from bloating and nausea all the way up to heart attack and stroke, Pasricha says.\n\nTo prevent these risks, the health care professionals we spoke to for this story say it's important to get to know the painkillers in your medicine cabinet. Here are 10 things they wish you knew about these drugs.\n\nPhoto illustration by Beck Harlan/NPR\n\n1. Acetaminophen is usually the better choice for fevers, says University of California San Francisco (UCSF) clinical pharmacist Candy Tsourounis. Commonly known as Tylenol, it's thought to reduce fever and relieve minor aches and pains by raising your body's pain threshold and regulating your body temperature. It's also gentler on the body than NSAIDs are.\n\n2. NSAIDs are generally considered more effective than acetaminophen for pain relief, Tsourounis says, especially for inflammatory pain like muscle aches. While acetaminophen is thought to work only on the central nervous system, NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (like Advil or Motrin) or naproxen (like Aleve) work throughout the body to reduce inflammation, pain and fever.\n\n3. Taking too much acetaminophen at one time or too many doses close together can cause liver damage, Tsourounis says. So stick to 3,000 milligrams of the drug at most per day, and don't mix it with alcohol, which is also hard on the liver.\n\n4. NSAIDs carry risks to the gut and the heart. Common side effects include stomach pain, heartburn and bloating. You can also experience more serious damage like ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding or kidney damage if you take NSAIDs at too high a dose or even just for too long a time period, Pasricha says. And non-aspirin NSAIDs have the potential to raise your blood pressure. Every NSAID has a different max dose, so pay attention to your labels.\n\ntoggle caption Photo illustration by Beck Harlan/NPR\n\n5. If you're not sure which painkiller to use or how much to take, talk to a pharmacist, says Blamoh Twegbe, pharmacy manager at UCSF outpatient pharmacy. \"Please utilize us. That's what we're here for!\" They can help you make an informed decision by asking about your type of pain and chronic conditions and by checking any potential drug interactions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n6. There's a limit to how much pain NSAIDs can treat, Pasricha says. If you take more than the recommended dosage or more than one type of NSAID at once — for example, combining Motrin and Aleve — you're increasing your risk of side effects without getting any additional pain relief. If you feel your over-the-counter (OTC) drugs aren't working, talk to a doctor or pharmacist instead of ignoring the warning label.\n\ntoggle caption Photo illustration by Beck Harlan/NPR\n\n7. If you're habitually reaching for the same OTC pain medication, talk to your health care provider. For example, if you're taking naproxen every day of your period every month because of muscle cramps. Pasricha says that pain might signal a larger underlying health problem that could be better treated with prescription medication, lifestyle changes or both.\n\n8. Beware of accidentally overmedicating with a combination OTC drugs. Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are often included in a lot of other sick-day remedies, like migraine medication, allergy pills or all-in-one cold and flu medicines, Twegbe says. So when you're not feeling well, double-check your labels before assuming you need a dose of Tylenol on top of those cold-relief meds.\n\ntoggle caption Photo illustration by Beck Harlan/NRP\n\n9. Alternate between NSAIDs and acetaminophen to manage major pain and reduce side effects. If you're suffering from the flu or nursing a new injury and need strong and steady pain relief, switching between acetaminophen and an NSAID like ibuprofen every few hours can be a safe and effective way to help you cope until your symptoms subside, Twegbe says. Just make sure to follow recommended dosages and dosing times for each medication.\n\n10. Think beyond pills. Because over-the-counter pain relievers are so readily available, people often forget that pills aren't the only option when suffering from minor aches and pains, Pasricha says. Many NSAIDs and other analgesics are available in topical form, like creams or patches, and can offer similar relief without the potential side effects to your gut.\n\nThere are also nonmedication remedies, like heating pads to ease back pain or exercising in water for arthritis. Talk to your doctor about your alternatives, Pasricha says. \"They might even control your pain more reliably than just taking medicine.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

            "content": "The power of a 2-minute walk\n\n\n\nHow to make this a habit\n\n\n\nPost-breakfast walk around the house: Instead of heading straight to work mode, pace around your living room while planning your day or replying to texts.\n\nAfter lunch office loop: Walk a lap around your office floor or even just head to the farthest restroom and back.\n\nDinner wind-down walk: Take your family or your dog out for a short stroll after dinner. It’s good for everyone.\n\nStaircase strolls: Just walk up and down a few stairs at a casual pace. You’ll get your steps in and help digestion too\n\nMake it casual. Make it enjoyable. Maybe even call someone during that walk or listen to a short podcast.\n\n20 mins of extra walking every day slashes cardiovascular disease risk\n\nYou must have heard about walking 10,000 steps a day. But what if you were told that just 2 minutes of walking—yes, a chill, post-meal kind of walk—could actually help you fight off some serious health issues like diabetes and heart disease?In today’s fast-paced, work-from-home, always-in-a-rush lifestyle, we rarely move around after meals. We eat and then slump into the couch, scroll endlessly, or get back to our laptops. Over time, this sedentary behavior builds up and silently starts messing with our metabolism, blood sugar, and heart health .But here’s where the magic of mini walks comes in.Sitting down after a full meal feels like a natural reflex. But here’s the not-so-fun truth: right after you eat, your blood sugar levels spike, especially if your meal was rich in carbs. This spike requires insulin to kick in and shuttle that sugar into your cells. Now, if you're just lounging around post-meal, your muscles aren’t helping out much. They’re inactive, which means your body takes longer to bring those blood sugar levels down. Over time, this constant spike-crash cycle can lead to insulin resistance. That’s a direct ticket to type 2 diabetes. Add to that the extra calories that don't get used and end up being stored as fat, often around your belly—aka the danger zone for heart disease.Now, studies are showing that just 2 minutes of light walking after eating can dramatically reduce your post-meal blood sugar levels. It sounds almost impossible that such a tiny amount of effort can have such a big impact, but science backs it up. One major study published in Sports Medicine in 2022 analyzed several trials and concluded that people who took short walks (2 to 5 minutes) after meals had significantly lower blood sugar levels compared to those who just sat around. Even just standing helped a little, but walking was clearly better. When you walk, even casually, your leg and core muscles start contracting and your body starts using up the glucose floating around in your blood.Walking right after meals helps avoid that post-lunch slump. You stay more alert, energetic, and less bloated. And all of this goodness happens in just two minutes.Diabetes and heart disease often go hand in hand. When your blood sugar is out of control, it affects your blood vessels, your blood pressure, and your overall cardiovascular health. The more sugar floating around unnecessarily, the more damage to your arteries over time. Leisure walking improves circulation, lowers blood pressure, and reduces triglycerides (those nasty fats in your blood). It also reduces inflammation, which is a key culprit in both heart disease and insulin resistance. Even short walks, when done regularly, can help your heart stay young. You don’t need a treadmill or running shoes. Just your feet and a little commitment.Here are a few easy ways to sneak in your 2-minute stroll:Start with 2 minutes within 60 to 90 minutes after a meal, ideally sooner. The earlier you move after eating, the more effective it is in flattening that blood sugar spike. Of course, if you have more time and energy, walking for 10-15 minutes gives even better results. But remember: 2 minutes is still infinitely better than zero.In a world obsessed with high-intensity workouts and 30-day challenges, we often underestimate the power of small, consistent habits. And walking for just 2 minutes after a meal might be one of the most underrated health hacks out there. It doesn’t feel like much. It might even feel silly at first. But over time, it adds up to lower blood sugar, better heart health, more energy, and possibly even weight loss. So here’s your reminder: the next time you eat, don’t just sit there. Walk a little. Let your body do its thing."

They were infectious both days and stayed overnight at the hotel before returning to the airport April 7.\n\nThe person was at the following public locations before being diagnosed with measles, according to Public Health. Because the measles virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after someone infected leaves the area, these times include the estimated period when the individual was at the location and two hours after:\n\nApril 6, 5:45-10 p.m. — Seattle-Tacoma International Airport: Gate S10 in S Concourse, international arrivals, baggage claim Carousel 20 and Gina Marie Hall (southernmost exit near international airlines)\n\nApril 6, 8:45 p.m. until April 7, 7 a.m. — Comfort Suites Tukwila Airport, 7200 Fun Center Way\n\nApril 7, 4:45-7:30 a.m. — Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Gate S1 in S Concourse\n\nThe person was likely exposed to measles while traveling abroad, according to public health officials.\n\nThe measles vaccine is highly effective. Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR, provide about 97% protection against getting infected during a lifetime.\n\nAdvertising\n\nMost people have immunity to measles through vaccination, so the risk to the general public is low, according to Public Health. However, Public Health recommends anyone who was in the locations of potential exposure to measles around the times listed should:\n\nFind out if you have been vaccinated for measles or have had measles previously. Make sure you are up-to-date with the recommended number of measles vaccinations.\n\nCall a health care provider promptly if you develop an illness with fever or an unexplained rash. To avoid possibly spreading measles to others, do not go to a clinic or hospital without calling first to tell them you want to be checked for measles after an exposure. It is also important to limit contact with others, especially those without known immunity.\n\nIf you were at the locations at the times listed above and are not immune to measles, the most likely time you would become sick would be between April 13 and April 29. People who are immunocompromised may take longer to experience symptoms.\n\nSpread of measles can occur before people know they have it and before any rash appears.\n\nMeasles cases are rising in the U.S. There have been more measles cases in the country during the first three months of 2025 than in all of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

No, I drink the same Yes, I drink less\n\nWalk like it matters\n\n\n\nEat half a plate of veggies every day\n\n\n\nLive with a purpose\n\n\n\nLimit alcohol\n\n\n\nCancer prevention isn’t about fear\n\n\n\nLet’s face it: when you hear the word cancer, it instantly sends a shiver down your spine. It’s one of those scary health topics no one really wants to think about, but deep down, we all wonder, “Am I doing enough to protect myself?” You don’t need to flip your life upside down or live in a bubble to reduce your cancer risk. There are small, super doable things you can start doing today that actually make a big difference over time.Recently, a cancer doctor Dr Amy Morris, who herself is a cancer survivor shared 4 essential things one must do in order to stay cancer free. In a video, shared on her Instagram account, Dr Morris says, \"As a cancer thriver, you’ve already done so much to get rid of cancer. Chemo, Surgery, Radiation. But now that all of that is done, you are likely wondering how do you STAY cancer free?\"Dr Morris talks about habits that are easy, natural, and can even make you feel happier, more energetic, and just... better. These four daily habits may sound basic, but together, they pack a punch when it comes to long-term protection.Walking. Sounds almost too simple, right? But regular walking—like even 30 minutes a day, can dramatically reduce your risk for certain cancers, especially breast, colon, and endometrial cancers.Walking helps maintain a healthy weight. Fat cells don’t just sit there; they produce hormones and inflammation that can fuel cancer. It improves digestion, meaning things move along faster in your gut (hello, reduced colon cancer risk). It boosts your immune system, which is your body's personal security guard against rogue cancer cells. You don’t have to power walk or wear fancy shoes. Just sneak it in: take phone calls while walking, park a bit further, or stroll after dinner. And yes, 10-minute walks three times a day are just as good as one long walk. It's the movement that matters!We’ve all heard \"eat your vegetables\" since kindergarten—but this simple advice may be one of your strongest cancer-fighting tools. Why half a plate? Because when veggies take up that much space, they naturally crowd out the less healthy stuff—like refined carbs and fatty meats. More color, less cancer risk.Cruciferous veggies (like broccoli, cabbage) are loaded with sulforaphane—a natural compound shown to fight cancer cells. Leafy greens are packed with antioxidants and folate, which help repair damaged cells. Fiber in vegetables keeps your gut happy and reduces the risk of colon cancer. Add spinach or grated carrots to your dal or roti dough. Top toast with avocado or cucumber. Toss whatever’s in the fridge into a stir-fry—no recipe needed. And no, it doesn’t have to be expensive. Even humble okra, pumpkin, or bottle gourd have their own protective superpowers.This one might sound a little too much to follow, but it’s legit: people who feel like they have a sense of purpose—something meaningful that gets them out of bed—tend to have lower inflammation, stronger immune function, and better long-term health. Living with purpose doesn’t mean you need to start a foundation or move to the mountains. It can be as simple as volunteering once a month, spending time with people who matter, growing a garden, creating something—art, music, a little blog or just waking up with an intention beyond the to-do list. When your life feels meaningful, your stress levels go down—and that’s huge, because chronic stress can weaken your immune system, mess with hormones, and even encourage cell mutations.Alcohol—even in small amounts—can increase the risk of several cancers, including breast, liver, mouth, and esophageal. Why? Alcohol turns into acetaldehyde in the body, a toxic chemical that can damage DNA and stop cells from repairing themselves. That’s literally the start of cancer.Not ready to quit? Have alcohol-free weekdays. Switch to smaller glasses. Sip slowly and space out drinks with water. Even cutting down a little can reduce your risk. It’s not about perfection—it’s about progress.It’s about empowerment. These daily choices won’t just reduce your cancer risk—they’ll improve your quality of life right now. More energy. Better sleep. Stronger immunity. Sharper mood. And the best part? These aren’t fads or expensive supplements. They’re simple, sustainable habits that work with your lifestyle—not against it.So take a walk. Eat your veggies. Follow your joy. Skip that second drink. Your everyday choices matter more than you think."

Syda Productions – stock.adobe.com\n\nAside from talking about his experiences at work, after a commenter asked about what happens to one’s bowel movements after they’ve passed on, Walsh gave insight in another video into what happens to a body after it dies.\n\n“If your bladder or bowels are full when you die, you obviously relax when you pass, so it does happen.”\n\nThe undertaker reassured the living that it’s nothing to be embarrassed about: “When we take you back into our care, before we dress and prepare you, we wash and shower you. It’s not really a big deal for us.”\n\nRegardless of which video you watch of Walsh’s, the comment section on each of them is people asking him questions about his work — or thanking him for being such a kind individual.\n\n“Very compassionate and sensitively handled. Well done Sir!” read one comment.\n\n“You sir are a credit to our vocation,” another proud person wrote.\n\nA person who knows a bit about Walsh’s job shared their experience: “I was married to an undertaker years ago, and we lived above the funeral home. I used to run through the mortuary with my eyes closed to get to the garage where my car was, never witnessed anything though.”"

All are unvaccinated or their vaccine status is not known, the release said.\n\nCounty health officials are working to establish who else may have been exposed to the disease in recent days.\n\n“The [Gallatin City County Health Department] continues to assess any potential exposures while the individuals were contagious and are contacting the people who may have been exposed. People potentially exposed are being provided with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for,” the state press release said.\n\nOn its website, Gallatin County health officials listed two locations where members of the public could have been exposed to measles.\n\nInterwest Tire on Jackrabbit Lane in Belgrade on Monday, April 14, between 12 p.m. and 4 p.m.\n\nNorth Coast Electric in Bozeman on Shedhorn Drive on Friday, April 11, between 7:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.\n\nThe announcement makes Montana one of 26 nationwide jurisdictions with measles cases, according to the most recent information from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of April 10, the federal agency had confirmed 712 cases.\n\nMontana officials said the infected people were exposed to the disease while traveling out of state, but did not say where.\n\nThe vast majority of nationwide cases, 97%, have affected people who are not vaccinated against measles, according to the CDC. About 70% of cases have occurred among those 19 years old and younger. Two children have died from the disease during the ongoing outbreak. A third death is under investigation.\n\nIn its Thursday press release, the state health department said that people “without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.”\n\nThe measles virus has an average incubation period of 14 days. Infectious particles can hang in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after someone leaves the area. A person carrying the virus can spread it to others days before they begin showing symptoms.\n\nState officials described early measles symptoms as including “fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth, and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure.” Infants under 12 months of age, who are typically not recommended to get either of the two-dose MMR vaccine series, are particularly at risk of infection.\n\nSome of the long-term health consequences from measles can include brain swelling, seizures, hearing loss, pneumonia, miscarriage and death.\n\nThe state health department said that a high level of vaccination at the community level helps protect infants and others who cannot be vaccinated from disease. The release did not state Gallatin County’s vaccination rate against measles.\n\n“While it is unfortunate to have cases of measles after 35 years of disease inactivity in Montana, we have been working diligently with our local partners to prepare,” said Dr. Maggie Cook-Shimanek, the state health department’s public health physician, in the Thursday announcement. “We are confident that our public health and clinical partners will work together and address this situation as quickly as possible. It is important for everyone to know their vaccination status and to visit with their health department or health care provider if they are unsure.”\n\nMontana legislation backed by Republican lawmakers in 2021 stripped a requirement from state law that required state officials to collect aggregated vaccination and exemption data from school districts and child care centers, creating a statewide information void about local vaccination rates.\n\nA bill to reverse that decision, House Bill 364, has stalled in the state Legislature."

            "content": "Researchers at Mass General Brigham found that by December 2023, over one-third of all new prescriptions for type 2 diabetes were for GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutide or tirzepatide.\n\nNew research shows a major shift in how weight loss and type 2 diabetes are managed, with newer drugs like tirzepatide rapidly replacing older medications such as metformin and insulin. Between 2021 and 2023, use of GLP-1RA-based medications surged, especially tirzepatide, highlighting evolving prescribing patterns and the growing focus on obesity treatment.\n\nWhen it comes to managing weight loss and type 2 diabetes, it’s out with the old and in with the new. A study from Mass General Brigham analyzing insurance claims from nearly 2 million people between 2021 and 2023 highlights a major shift in the use of glucose- and weight-related medications.\n\nThe data show a sharp rise in the use of newly approved drugs, especially tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss, while older treatments like metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin have seen a decline.\n\nThe findings, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, reflect a rapidly evolving approach to managing type 2 diabetes and obesity.\n\n“Taken together, these findings highlight the rapidly shifting landscape of prescribing patterns for glucose-lowering and weight-lowering medications,” said lead author John W. Ostrominski, MD, of the Cardiovascular Division, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Hypertension, and Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. “These changing trends likely reflect the combination of new evidence, increased awareness and prioritization of obesity treatment, and changing guidance for how to help patients manage these conditions.”\n\nRise of GLP-1RA-Based Medications\n\nThe study, which was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, examined claims data among people with commercial insurance. The researchers report that in January 2021, approximately half of the weight-lowering medications initiated by people without diabetes were GLP-1RA-based medications such as semaglutide and tirzepatide. By December 2023, this percentage increased to nearly 90%, with tirzepatide being the most commonly started (31%). Use of other weight loss medications, such as phentermine and liraglutide, declined.\n\nAmong people with type 2 diabetes, 13% started GLP-1RA-based medications in January 2021. That rate rose to 35% by December 2023. Metformin, the most commonly started glucose-lowering medication in January 2021 (30%), declined to 19% by December 2023.\n\nWhen the authors compared the immediate post-approval uptake of tirzepatide to other medications recently approved for type 2 diabetes or obesity, they found that the rise in tirzepatide’s use was steeper and more sustained.\n\nImplications for Healthcare Providers and Policymakers\n\n“We saw a sharp uptake of tirzepatide after regulatory approval—these kinds of trends are important for patients, clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to be aware of,” said Ostrominski. “The rapidly expanding uptake of tirzepatide and GLP-1RA underscores the need for clinicians to become more familiar with their use, for researchers to improve understanding of their long-term effects, and for health policy that promotes sustained access and affordability.”\n\nThe researchers note several limitations to the work, including that it is uncertain whether the findings from commercially insured U.S. adults are generalizable to other populations and countries.\n\n“Importantly, we don’t yet have long-term data from outcomes trials for tirzepatide as we do for GLP-1RA, but preliminary data are reassuring,” said Ostrominski. “In the future, data comparing the benefits of tirzepatide versus semaglutide for glycemic control, obesity management, and cardiovascular outcomes will help us have more informed conversations with patients about choosing the medication that’s right for them.”\n\nReference: “Trends in Utilization of Glucose- and Weight-Lowering Medications After Tirzepatide Approval in the United States” by John W.

            "content": "Grabbing a coffee cup seems easy. But you need to be able to move your hand, stretch it out, and keep it steady.\n\nThese movements are difficult for people with Parkinson’s disease. The disorder eats away at brain cells—called dopamine neurons—that control movement and emotion. Symptoms begin with tremors. Then muscles lock up. Eventually, the disease makes walking and sleeping difficult. Thinking gets harder, and as neurons die, people lose their concentration and memory.\n\nMedications can keep some symptoms at bay, but eventually, their effects wear off. For nearly half a century, scientists have been exploring an alternative solution: Replacing dying dopamine neurons with new ones.\n\nThis month, two studies of nearly two dozen people with Parkinson’s showed the strategy is safe. A single transplant boosted dopamine levels for 18 months without notable side effects. Patients had fewer motor symptoms even when they stopped taking their regular medications.\n\nThe work stands out because instead of being tailored to each patient, the cells were ready-made. The teams grew new dopamine neurons from donors in the lab. These cells can multiply easily in petri dishes, forming a large supply of replacement cells for patients.\n\nMalin Parmar at Lund University, who was not involved in the study, told Nature the results are “a big leap in the field.”\n\nA Deteriorating Brain\n\nParkinson’s is the world’s second most common neurodegenerative disease, with up to 90,000 new cases a year in the US. Michael J. Fox, who played Marty McFly in Back to the Future and launched a foundation to find a Parkinson’s cure, is perhaps the most famous person living with the disease.\n\nIn Parkinson’s, neurons in the middle of the brain gradually die. Called the substantia nigra, the region is intricately connected with surrounding areas and is critical for movement and emotions. Although the entire area eventually deteriorates, neurons that pump out dopamine—a chemical that fine-tunes neural networks and functions—are first to go. This means the brain gradually loses dopamine as the disease progresses.\n\nThere are treatments but no cures.\n\nOne common medication, Levodopa, tackles symptoms. Neurons slurp up the drug and transform it into dopamine. But as brain cells gradually die, the medication becomes less effective. Levodopa also has side effects. Because midbrain wiring influences both addictive behaviors and motor control, flooding it with dopamine can change how people act, like increasing the risk of gambling addiction and other obsessive behaviors. Long-term use can also trigger random movements of the face, arms, and legs—a symptom called dyskinesia.\n\nBrain implants that bridge broken connections in the midbrain are another treatment. Deep brain stimulation, for example, mimics natural brain signals to ease motor symptoms. Some implants are already approved for use, but they require surgery and monitoring and aren’t widely accessible.\n\nRather than patching a broken circuit with a temporary fix, what if we could replace broken dopamine neurons with fresh ones?\n\nStem-Cell Marathon\n\nStem cells offer a solution. These special cells can grow into any other type of cell under the right conditions, making them the perfect replacement for dying neurons.\n\nBack in the 1980s, one team transplanted brain tissue rich in dopamine neurons into people with Parkinson’s. These patients experienced a boost of dopamine and improved motor control for years after the surgery. But the source was highly controversial: fetal brain tissue.\n\nAlthough a “first proof-of-concept for cell transplantation therapy,” the trial raised “ethical concerns,” according to Hideyuki Okano at the Keio University Regenerative Medicine Research Center in Japan, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nAs an alternative, scientists have learned to create stem cells in the lab. One method produces stem cell lines that can grow almost forever under the right conditions. In another, scientists chemically transform adult cells, often taken from the skin, into a stem-cell-like state. These are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Five years ago, a team converted iPSCs into dopamine neurons and transplanted them into a patient, improving symptoms for up to two years."

            "content": "Five classic risk factors for cardiovascular disease — high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, and smoking — at age 50 can reduce life expectancy by more than 10 years. This is the conclusion of an international study led by German researchers and presented at the 2025 American College of Cardiology Scientific Session.\n\n“These five factors account for approximately 50% of the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. Our central question was how many additional years of life are possible if these factors are absent or modified in middle age,” said Christina Magnussen, MD, PhD, deputy director of the Department of Cardiology at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany, during her presentation in Chicago.\n\nThe findings, also published in The New England Journal of Medicine, show that lifestyle changes and risk management in middle age can make a significant difference. Lowering blood pressure and quitting smoking had the most significant impacts.\n\nLifestyle Changes\n\nExperts praised the findings of this study. “The study shows that even at around age 50, individuals can make substantial changes to their lifestyle or prevention strategies on a personal level to significantly influence their life expectancy,” said Holger Thiele, MD, PhD, director of the Heart Center Leipzig at the University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany, and president of the German Society of Cardiology.\n\nUlrich Laufs, MD, PhD, director of the Department of Cardiology at Leipzig University Hospital, added, “The study impressively confirms the importance of the five risk factors: Smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and over- or underweight. With a simple examination at middle age — 50 years — the lifetime risk for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke, as well as for all-cause mortality, can be predicted.”\n\nPersistent Risk Factors\n\nMagnussen’s research group analyzed data from over two million people across 39 countries. They examined whether participants had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, underweight or overweight/obesity, diabetes, or smoking habit at age 50. The participants were followed-up for up to 47 years. Magnussen noted that the study allows risk predictions up to age 90.\n\n“The lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease was considerable, even when none of the five risk factors were present — 13% for women and 21% for men. When all five risk factors were present, it rose to 24% for women and 38% for men,” Magnussen reported.\n\nFor women with all five risk factors at age 50, cardiovascular events occurred 13 years earlier than in their peers without these risks, and for men, these events occurred nearly 11 years earlier.\n\nThe mortality risk followed a similar trend. Without risk factors, the risk of death was 53% in women and 68% in men. With all five risk factors, the risk increased to 88% for women and 94% for men. Women with all five risk factors had a decreased life expectancy of 14.5 years, while men experienced a decrease of nearly 12 years.\n\nKey Interventions\n\nThe study also demonstrated that these outcomes are not predetermined. By modifying lifestyle and treating risk factors, the risks for cardiovascular disease and death can be reduced, even in middle age.\n\nMagnussen highlighted blood pressure control and smoking cessation as the most effective interventions:\n\nLowering high blood pressure between the ages of 55 and 60 years delayed cardiovascular events by an average of 2.4 years for women and 1.2 years for men\n\nQuitting smoking at this age added 2.1 years for women and 2.4 years for men\n\n“The higher the number of risk factors that could be controlled in this short period, the higher the number of potential additional years of life. Modifying all five risk factors was associated with additional 5 years of life,” she said.\n\nLimitations\n\nThiele emphasized the study’s strong methodology, supported by the large number of participants and the long follow-up period. He also noted the importance of analyzing data on differences between women and men.\n\nHowever, Thiele pointed out the limited influence of cholesterol and body mass index in their study. “Here, U- or J-shaped curves show varying risks of developing cardiovascular diseases or death. This is certainly challenging to adjust for statistically,” he said.\n\nLaufs added that the study’s global scope and the use of over two million datasets from around the world, while a strength, posed challenges. “The data were collected in very different ways and under varying conditions, requiring the authors to perform ‘harmonization,’ meaning mathematical adjustments based on assumptions.”\n\nThis could explain why the study differs from others in one aspect, that is, in the study, only approximately 50% of the risk was explained by the five factors, whereas other studies have shown a higher proportion. The relative importance of risk factors, such as body weight, differed from that of cholesterol. “However, this limitation stems from the strength of the global perspective and does not diminish the study’s core findings,” Laufs stated.\n\nIn her presentation, Magnussen also noted that the associations shown do not prove causation. Unmeasured factors such as physical activity, diet, education, income, and environmental influences could partly explain these results.\n\nFocus on Prevention\n\nThese findings have significant implications for clinical practice. “Our findings call for targeted interventions addressing specific risk factors, particularly during the critical middle-aged decade. Hypertension and smoking should be the primary focus of primary prevention,” said Magnussen.\n\nThiele stressed the importance of these findings, particularly in the German population. “In Germany, the main risk factors examined in this study — smoking, overweight, diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol — are significantly more prevalent in the population compared to other European countries.”\n\nGermany requires significantly more investment in both individual and community-based prevention. “The approach to the Healthy Heart Act was already moving in the correct direction. This now needs to be incorporated into a new coalition agreement and developed into a national cardiovascular strategy focusing on individual prevention with early detection measures and structural interventions,” noted Thiele.\n\nThis story was translated from Medscape’s German edition using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.

(CREDIT: Shutterstock)\n\nIn the fight against cancer, researchers continue to look for everyday habits that might make a difference. A recent global study has shed new light on something many people do daily—drink coffee or tea. This study explored whether these popular beverages could lower the risk of head and neck cancer, a group of diseases that includes cancers of the mouth, throat, and voice box.\n\nThe results may give hope to millions of coffee and tea drinkers worldwide. The findings suggest that drinking coffee, both caffeinated and decaffeinated, and even tea in certain amounts, may be linked to lower chances of developing certain types of head and neck cancer.\n\nA Global Look at a Growing Cancer Concern\n\nHead and neck cancers are now the seventh most common type of cancer around the world. These cancers are becoming more frequent, especially in low- and middle-income countries. As more people are affected, scientists are working harder to understand how lifestyle choices might influence cancer risks.\n\nNew research suggests that daily coffee consumption may help lower the risk of head and neck cancers. (CREDIT: Science Photo Library)\n\nOver the years, studies on coffee and tea’s impact on these cancers have had mixed results. Some showed promise, while others found no clear link. To get a better picture, researchers from around the world came together to reanalyze a large amount of data. The team, led by the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, reviewed 14 different studies gathered by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) consortium.\n\nThis group looked at information from nearly 25,000 people. Of these, 9,548 had head and neck cancer, and 15,783 did not. Participants answered detailed questions about how much coffee and tea they drank over time. This included whether the coffee was regular or decaffeinated and how often they consumed it.\n\nWhat the Study Revealed About Coffee\n\nThe results showed a clear trend: people who drank more than four cups of caffeinated coffee per day had lower odds of getting head and neck cancer. Specifically, these individuals had: 17% lower odds of developing any type of head and neck cancer, 30% lower odds of developing cancer of the mouth, and 22% lower odds of developing throat cancer.\n\nEven more striking, those who drank three to four cups daily had a 41% lower risk of developing hypopharyngeal cancer. This is a rare but serious type of cancer that starts at the bottom part of the throat, near the voice box.\n\nEven decaffeinated coffee seemed to offer benefits. People who drank decaf had 25% lower odds of getting oral cavity cancer. This finding is important because it suggests that something other than caffeine—possibly antioxidants or other plant-based compounds in coffee—might be helping protect cells.\n\nTea's Role in Cancer Risk\n\nTea also showed some promise, especially when it came to hypopharyngeal cancer. People who drank tea had 29% lower odds of getting this type of cancer. Those who drank one cup or less per day had:\n\n9% lower risk of head and neck cancer overall\n\n27% lower risk of hypopharyngeal cancer\n\nStudy-specific odds ratios for >4 cups of caffeinated coffee daily versus non–coffee drinkers for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers. (CREDIT: American Cancer Society)\n\nHowever, the relationship between tea and cancer risk wasn’t all positive. Drinking more than one cup of tea daily was linked with a 38% higher chance of developing laryngeal cancer, which affects the voice box.\n\nThis surprising result shows that the effects of tea might vary depending on how much is consumed and which part of the head or neck is involved.\n\nWhat These Findings Mean\n\n“While there has been prior research on coffee and tea consumption and reduced risk of cancer, this study highlighted their varying effects with different sub-sites of head and neck cancer, including the observation that even decaffeinated coffee had some positive impact,” said Yuan-Chin Amy Lee, the study’s senior author.\n\nLee, an adjunct associate professor in public health, pointed out that coffee and tea habits can be complex. People drink them in many different ways—some with milk or sugar, some plain, and in different amounts.\n\nThese habits might influence how coffee or tea affects the body. “These findings support the need for more data and further studies around the impact that coffee and tea can have on reducing cancer risk,” Lee added.\n\nThis study doesn't prove that coffee or tea prevents cancer. But it does suggest that these beverages could play a role in lowering the risk for some people. The research also helps show how different types of head and neck cancer may respond differently to substances found in these drinks.\n\nTakeaways for Everyday Life\n\nIf you're someone who drinks coffee or tea, this study offers some good news. While more research is needed, moderate coffee drinking could be linked with lower chances of developing certain cancers of the head and neck. Even decaf coffee might help.\n\nCharacteristics of head and neck cancer cases and controls of select INHANCE consortium studies. (CREDIT: American Cancer Society)\n\nWhen it comes to tea, a cup a day might help protect against some cancers, but more than that could raise the risk for others. This suggests a careful balance is needed. The kind of tea, how it’s made, and what’s added to it could all play a role in how it affects your health.\n\nAs always, no single food or drink can fully protect you from cancer. But understanding how common habits influence health is a key part of cancer prevention. These new findings may encourage more people to look at how everyday choices—like what you drink—could add up over time to support better health.\n\nNote: The article above provided above by The Brighter Side of News."

            "content": "A microscope image of the tissue around the rete ovarii, an organ that may play an important role in female fertility.\n\nAn unsung appendage in the female body, which has long been considered useless, may actually be essential for ovary development and fertility, a new mouse study finds.\n\nThis structure, called the rete ovarii, was first discovered in humans over a century ago, but until now, it was considered a so-called vestigial structure — not crucial in adult female anatomy, but a leftover from fetal development. Vestigial anatomical structures, or \"vestiges,\" are generally thought to have once had a crucial function that was later lost in the course of human evolution.\n\nBut according to a new study, published March 19 in the journal eLife , the rete ovarii (RO) may actually play an important role in ovarian function, and therefore, fertility. The work also showed that the structure has three distinct regions and may respond to hormonal signals.\n\n\"The female reproductive tract is often thought to consist of the vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, oviduct, and ovaries,\" the researchers wrote in their paper. \"We suggest that the RO be added to this list and investigated as an additional component of female reproductive function.\"\n\nAlthough their study is based in mice, the researchers think it likely applies to people because the structure is also present in a number of other mammal species, including cows, cats, sheep, pigs, dogs and monkeys. Additionally, humans and mice share similar early sex-organ development pathways, so the scientists assume that the structure and its developmental cues might be similar in humans.\n\nRelated: 10 body parts that are useless in humans (or maybe not)\n\nThe RO is a horseshoe-shaped network of tubes nestled beneath the ovary, at the site where blood vessels and nerves enter the organ. However, despite the structure being highly conserved among mammals, when it was first found in humans in 1870, scientists deemed it to have no use .\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Some of their experiments used living mice, so that the researchers could study how the RO develops in the womb. Other tissues analyzed in the study were collected from euthanized animals after death.\n\nThe study found that the RO contains three distinct regions that mature during fetal development and then are maintained in adulthood. These regions include the intraovarian rete (IOR), located within the ovary itself; the extraovarian rete (EOR), made of convoluted tubules that join up into a bulb at one end ; and the connecting rete (CR), a transitional zone between the IOR and EOR.\n\nUsing mass spectrometry — a technique used to identify and quantify molecules — the researchers discovered that, at birth, the EOR contains thousands of proteins within its tubes that its own cells appear to produce. One protein was insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), may be involved in ovary function. The protein may modulate the availability and activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which are structurally similar to insulin and important for the development of the follicles that carry immature eggs and hormones in the ovary.\n\nIn other experiments, the researchers watched fluorescent dye move through the EOR, revealing that fluid within the EOR is propelled toward the ovary. This further suggests that the RO has a role in ovarian function.\n\nIn another analysis, they found that the cells of the RO expressed, or switched on, genes that code for a variety of hormone receptors, including receptors for the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones play important roles in female reproduction and health, helping to orchestrate the menstrual cycle, among other jobs.\n\n\"It appears that the rete ovarii may have a role in ovarian homeostasis - maintaining the ovaries and their environment,\" Taylor suggested. \"Similarly they appear to be able to detect fluid movement in and around the ovaries and their microenvironment. Finally and most interestingly is the potential endocrine [hormonal] role that the rete ovarii may have.\"\n\nThe researchers behind the study suggest that the EOR may \"act as an antenna\" to receive signals from the rest of the body, both via hormones and nerves, and then send that information on to the ovary via the proteins it secretes and transports.\n\n\"There's still so much we can't even begin to comprehend about female anatomy,\" study lead author Dilara Anbarci , a developmental biologist at the University of Michigan, told Science News . \"I hope this encourages more investigation in reevaluating what we don't already know about the ovary.\"\n\nThe researchers hope to further investigate the function and component structures of the rete ovarii, looking into how the EOR actually responds to hormones and whether the proteins it secretes change in response to changes in the body.\n\nThis research challenges the traditional view of the RO being considered redundant, proposing instead that it has a secret wealth of functions. Figuring out how the rete ovarii works could one day help scientists better understand and treat conditions of the female reproductive system.\n\n\"The endocrine system plays a key role in gynaecological health,\" Taylor said. \"A greater understanding of any structures in this region has the potential to open up new therapeutic avenues and opportunities in treating various conditions.\""

            "description": "A growing body of evidence suggests artificial sweeteners may have many harms for health.",
            "content": "Artificial sweeteners are being added to a growing number of foods to reduce their sugar content while maintaining their appealing taste. But a growing body of research suggests these non-nutritive sweeteners may not always be a healthier and safer option. So what is our best option if we want to enjoy sweet-tasting foods without the harms of eating sugar?\n\nArtificial sweeteners were originally developed as chemicals to stimulate our sweet-taste sensing pathway. Like sugar molecules, these sweeteners act directly on our taste sensors in the mouth. They do this by sending a nerve signal to the body that a high-carbohydrate food source has been consumed – telling the body to break it down to use for energy.\n\nIn the case of sugar consumption, this also stimulates our dopaminergic system. This is the part of the brain responsible for motivation and reward, linked to sugar cravings. From an evolutionary perspective, this means we’re hardwired to seek out high-sugar food for a source of energy and to ensure our survival. However, excessive consumption of sugar is well known to lead to health problems, such as metabolic disruption which can cause obesity and diabetes.\n\nSimilarly, when artificial sweeteners, rather than sugar, cause this stimulation, there’s increasing evidence of similar metabolic imbalances. This happens despite the fact that artificial sweeteners do not seem to stimulate the dopamine system.\n\nIndeed, a study published earlier this year showed that within two hours of consuming sucralose (an amount equivalent to the sugar in two cans of soft drink), participants exhibited increased physiological hunger responses. The research measured blood flow to the hypothalamus, the region of our brain responsible for appetite control. They found that sucralose increased blood flow to this area of the brain.\n\nStudies have also shown that sweeteners can stimulate the same neurons as the appetite hormone, leptin. Over time, this could cause our hunger threshold to increase – meaning we need to eat more food to feel full. This suggests that consuming artificial sweeteners makes us more hungry, which could ultimately make us consume more calories.\n\nAnd it doesn’t stop with feeling hungrier. A large study, which was conducted over 20 years, found a link between sweetener consumption and greater accumulation of body fat. Interestingly, the study found that people who regularly consumed large amounts of sweeteners (equivalent to three or four cans of diet soda per day) had a nearly 70% greater incidence of obesity compared to those who consumed minimal amounts of artificial sweeteners (equivalent to half a can of diet soda per day).\n\nThe study also considered this response to be independent of the amount of calories the participants consumed each day. To verify this, they reviewed food questionnaires to assess self-reported dietary intake. While self-reported consumption can have discrepancies, the study also used a coding nutrition data system to verify dietary intake. The results indicate that artificial sweeteners may be making us more likely to form fat in our body – regardless of what we’re consuming alongside the artificial sweeteners.\n\nA study published earlier this month also found that daily consumption of artificially sweetened drinks positively correlated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes. But given these drinks contain a range of additives – including acidifiers, dyes, emulsifiers and sweeteners – it’s uncertain if this link can be entirely attributed to artificial sweeteners.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nSo is it time to give up sweeteners completely? Maybe not. There are many studies which add to the controversy by showing that short-term substitution of sugar with artificial sweeteners reduces body weight and body fat.\n\nNumerous studies have also shown that artificial sweetener consumption has no association with the development of diabetes or even with indicators of diabetes, such as fasting glucose or insulin levels. However, many of these studies were performed over relatively short time periods (up to 12 months) and only compared people consuming artificial sweeteners versus sugar. This makes it hugely confusing for all of us to know what we should do.\n\nTo address this, earlier this month, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), which advises the UK government on nutrition, released a position statement on the use of non-sugar sweeteners. This was in response to the World Health Organization, which suggested that sweeteners shouldn’t be used as a means of weight control due to their low-level association with risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe SACN similarly concluded that non-sugar sweetener intake be minimised, especially for children. But they also stated that intake of sugars in general needs to be reduced. This is really at the heart of the issue. Artificial sweeteners may have significant negative health impacts, but are they as bad for us as sugar? The overwhelming literature on the negatives of excess sugar consumption currently suggests no – but our understanding of artificial sweeteners is still not as extensive as that for sugar.\n\nWe need more research on artificial sweeteners to better understand their effects. Work is currently ongoing to collate a database of all clinical trials investigating sweetener use. This will allow us to better understand the sweetener research landscape and highlight areas where more work is needed.\n\nUntil then, what should we do if we have a sweet-tooth? Unfortunately, like everything with nutrition, it’s best to only consume artificial sweeteners in moderation.\n\nThere are no clear guidelines on the amounts of sweeteners we should or shouldn’t be consuming yet. But one of the guidelines from the recent SACN review is that the industry clearly label the amount of artificial sweeteners in food and drink. So hopefully it will be easier for us to make these choices in the future."

            "content": "Anti-vaccine activists with close ties to US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are falsely claiming that the measles public health crisis in Texas is caused by a “bioweapon” targeting the Mennonite community. These activists are now trying to sell their followers a range of pseudoscientific cures—some purportedly powered by artificial intelligence—that supposedly prevent customers from contracting measles.\n\nThe claims were made in a webinar posted online last week and hosted by Mikki Willis, an infamous conspiracy filmmaker best known for his Plandemic series of pseudo-documentaries. These helped supercharge Covid-19 disinformation online and were, Kennedy has said, funded in part by Children’s Health Defense (CHD), an anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded. Willis also created a video for Kennedy marking the announcement of his independent run for the presidency.\n\n“I’m not going to be careful by calling it a virus,” Willis said in the measles webinar. “I’m going to call it what it is, and that is a bioweapon, and my belief after interviewing these families is that this has been manipulated and targeted towards a community that is a threat because of their natural way of living.” (Measles is not a bioweapon. It is a viral infection that can be easily prevented by getting a vaccine.)\n\nThe webinar was hosted by Rebel Lion, the supplement company that Willis cofounded. On the website, and prominently featured under the webinar, Willis sells and recommends a “measles treatment and prevention protocol” full of supplements and tools on the site. On the webinar, Willis claimed the protocol will help parents “get prepped for, if God forbid this does get out, and their children get sick.” Together, purchasing the full protocol costs hundreds of dollars.\n\n“This is the standard radical anti-vaccine extremist playbook,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, tells WIRED. “You can see RFK Jr. has translated his anti-vaccine lies into political power. You can see others have converted it into economic power. And there’s some that just do it because it makes them feel good to be listened to, to be important, to be the center of a community. There’s always an ulterior motive.”\n\nThe community Willis refers to in the webinar is the Mennonite community in Seminole, a small city in west Texas, which has been the epicenter of the measles outbreak. Over 560 measles cases have been reported in Texas alone. To date, the deaths of two children have been linked to the measles outbreak, and another death is under investigation.\n\nWillis’ bogus claim about a bioweapon is part of a larger effort by the anti-vaccine community to undermine the threat posed by the infection. Many, instead, have claimed that the measles deaths were caused by other diseases or, in some cases, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine itself. These claims are not true and “there have been no deaths shown to be related to the MMR vaccine in healthy people,” according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America."

            "content": "Africa CDC and WHO have updated their joint Continental Response Plan for the mpox emergency as the disease continues to affect new areas. The revised strategy focuses on controlling outbreaks, while expanding vaccination coverage and transitioning toward a longer-term, sustainable response.\n\nMpox is a viral illness that spreads between people, mainly through close contact. It causes painful skin and mucosal lesions, often accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. The disease can be debilitating and disfiguring.\n\nHistorically a zoonotic disease transmitted from infected animals, mpox has increasingly shown a tendency to spread between people. In 2022, a variant of the virus, clade IIb, began spreading globally through sexual contact. Since late 2023, yet another viral strain, clade Ib, began spreading through sexual networks and within households and through close contact. This prompted Africa CDC to declare a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security and the WHO Director-General to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in August 2024.\n\nBy August 2024, the virus had begun spreading from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 4 neighbouring countries. Since then, 28 countries around the world have reported cases of mpox due to clade Ib. Outside Africa, cases remain largely travel-related. However, within Africa, in addition to transmission in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, local transmission has now been documented in additional countries including the Republic of the Congo, South Africa, South Sudan, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia.\n\nSince the declaration of the emergency, both regional and global support has increased, particularly for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the epicentre of the outbreak. The Africa CDC and WHO Joint Continental Mpox Plan has guided these efforts, focusing on ten key pillars: coordination, risk communication and community engagement, disease surveillance, laboratory capacity, clinical management, infection prevention and control, vaccination, research, logistics, and maintaining essential health services.\n\nVaccination efforts are underway, with more than 650 000 doses administered in 6 countries, 90% of which have been administered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Overall, over a million doses have been delivered to 10 countries, with efforts ongoing to secure additional vaccine supplies.\n\nDiagnostic testing capacity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has grown significantly, driven by the expansion of laboratory infrastructure - from 2 laboratories in late 2023 to 23 laboratories in 12 provinces today. With new, near-point-of-care tests currently being rolled out in the country, capacity is expected to increase even further.\n\nDespite this progress, major challenges remain. Ongoing conflict and insecurity in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the incidence of mpox remains high, as well as humanitarian aid cuts, continue to limit the public health response and restrict access to essential services. Across countries and partners, over US$ 220 million is needed to fill funding gaps for the mpox response.\n\nThe updated Continental Response Plan calls for intensified efforts to bring outbreaks under control, while also taking concrete actions to integrate mpox into routine health services.\n\nAlong with the Continental Response Plan for Africa, WHO has updated the global strategic plan to curb - and where feasible, to stop - human-to-human transmission of mpox. In the first two months of 2025, 60 countries reported mpox, with the majority of cases and deaths reported from the African continent. The joint Continental Response Plan is aligned with the global strategy."

Submit it here.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nMy daughters, ages 2 and 3, generally get along. They have similar interests, and both have a sense of humor. However when it comes to sharing, whether it’s me, a prized toy, or a spot at the sink to wash their hands, it often quickly turns into the 2-year-old hitting or pulling hair in an attempt to get her way. As you can imagine, this causes the 3-year-old to start screaming, then her sister starts screaming, then the 3-year-old starts crying, then they both are crying … you get the picture. The 3-year-old will hit back if I don’t get in there fast enough.\n\nMy question is: how do I intervene in a way that improves and supports their relationship? I always immediately pull the 2-year-old off of her sister and give the usual talk about how hands are not for hitting and we don’t hit people, and of course check to make sure everyone is ok. I keep seeing parenting advice about not intervening every time your kids fight because it doesn’t give them an opportunity to learn how to problem solve. However, what do you do when almost every fight involves someone getting hurt?\n\n—Reluctant Referee\n\nDear Reluctant Ref,\n\nYou’re doing the right thing by intervening immediately when it comes to violence. Problem solving is one thing, but I’m not familiar with any parenting advice that suggests letting them slug it out. Personally, I stop behavior in kids if it would be considered illegal for adults to do. We’re not allowed to go around hitting people. They shouldn’t be either. That goes for verbal assault too! Of course, good luck explaining to a two-year-old that an adult would get arrested for doing what they’re doing. Still, it doesn’t hurt to mention it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy layperson-armchair-psychology take is that the two year old is hitting because they are younger and don’t feel like they have a non-violent way to assert themselves. She’s probably smaller and not as good with words yet. Work with her on other ways to assert herself without resorting to fisticuffs. The moment you intervene, ask her if she can think of another way to get what she wants without hitting. See if you can get her to explain what her intentions were. For example, “I hit because I wanted to play with the slinky.” Also try to get her sister involved in the conversation.\n\nIdentify upcoming situations in which they’ll have to share as early as you can and prepare them for it. Before they even get to the sink, talk to them about how they’re going to use their words to determine who gets to use it first and how they’re going to tell the other one when they’re finished. When there’s something big they’ll both want, you can even practice ahead of time with each of them.\n\nGet advice—submit a question!

Dear Care and Feeding, * Your letter signoff Your pronouns Your email (optional and confidential—please include if you're open to Care and Feeding following up) Submit\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nFor the last ten years my husband and I have hosted the rest of the family for Easter, as we have a large backyard that is perfect for Easter egg hunts. However, we are in our early 70s now and are beginning to tire of it. At this point, my son and daughter have seven kids between them ranging in age from eight to eighteen months. It’s no longer as easy as when it was just them and their spouses and two or three kids along with my sister and her husband and son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I raised the topic with my daughter, she became angry. She accused me of “cancelling Easter at the last moment and ruining things for the kids” and said she and her brother were counting on us to make Easter happen for them like we always have because our backyard is the “best and safest” choice for the egg hunt. A conversation with my son went similarly sideways and I ended up caving and agreeing to host Easter this year. Do my husband and I have an obligation to continue this tradition until our grandkids have outgrown it?\n\n—Easter Grinch\n\nDear Grinch,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou do not have an obligation to keep hosting Easter. Your son and daughter overreacted to the idea of not having Easter at your house.\n\nBut, I think that you might stand to gain a lot by continuing to host—at least in some capacity. If possible, try to decelerate your involvement instead. Maybe this year you just do less. Let them use the yard, but have your son and daughter do all the work. They are young! Ask them to help prepare your house ahead of time and ask them to bring all the food and drinks. You can focus on your grandkids when they’re over, and then on cleaning up the house after they leave (or you can even ask your kids to hire a cleaner to do it for you).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you cancel altogether, be careful what you wish for. If you label yourself unable to host and generally exhausted, you might not see your grandkids as much as you’d like. And, while you might get tired from hosting a bunch of grandchildren, remember that they’ll be forming lasting memories of you. Don’t take that away from them just because their parents are being ungrateful or lazy. Put more of the burden on the parents.\n\nMy in-laws host Easter, too. They have a big yard with lots of great egg-hiding places. My kids are old enough now to find egg hunts a little dull and my in-laws are in their late 70s, but we still keep the tradition alive and invite friends with younger kids over too. These days my wife and I pitch in and try to do everything we can ahead of time, planning for a few weeks up to the day. We potluck it so that my in-laws don’t have to cook if they don’t want to. We help set up and help tear down. We know that it’s something the kids have done their entire lives and will remember fondly when they’re grown up.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, your kids’ overreaction to Easter does not bode well for the future. You need to prepare them for the idea of taking care of you instead of the other way around. Talk to them seriously about how as you age you’ll be able to handle less and less, but that your aging doesn’t mean you don’t want to see them—just that you’ll need more help. Look at Easter as an opportunity to practice coming to a compromise that works for everyone.\n\n—Greg"

            "content": "It’s spring skywatching at its best: The annual Lyrid meteor shower is back, offering people across the Northern Hemisphere a chance to catch shooting stars in the night sky.\n\nThe meteor shower began on April 16, but will reach its peak Monday night and into the early-morning hours of Tuesday. Weather permitting, skywatchers could see up to 15 shooting stars per hour during that period, as long as they’re in a dark location.\n\nThe Lyrids are typically one of the year’s most reliable meteor showers, and their timing coincides with more temperate spring temperatures across the Northern Hemisphere, making them a popular celestial show.\n\nThis year’s peak occurs with a waning crescent moon that will be about 27% full, according to NASA, which means the shooting stars are less likely to be washed out by bright moonlight.\n\nIn order to best enjoy the peak, NASA recommends watching outside from Monday night anytime after 10 p.m. local time until dawn the next morning, with a sweet spot at roughly 5 a.m. local time on Tuesday. But anytime late in the evening on Monday and before the moon rises overnight at around 3:30 a.m. local time should offer good chances to see meteors streaking across the night sky.\n\nThe Lyrids are usually observed most clearly from the Northern Hemisphere, but eagle-eyed skywatchers in the Southern Hemisphere may be able to spot some shooting stars, according to NASA.\n\nIf conditions are clear, it’s best to pick an unobstructed viewing location under the darkest possible skies, away from city lights and other forms of light pollution.\n\nSkywatchers should face roughly toward the east and look straight ahead. Meteors can streak from any point and the Lyrids are known to occasionally leave bright trails as they dart across the night sky.\n\nMeteor showers can be enjoyed without any special equipment, but experts suggest giving your eyes time to adjust to the dark, spending about 45 minutes without looking at cellphones or any bright points of light.\n\nMeteor showers occur when Earth passes through bits of debris left over from comets or asteroids. As our planet orbits the sun and swings through these clouds of rocks and dust, the pieces vaporize in the atmosphere and appear as streaks of light in the sky.\n\nThe Lyrids are caused by debris from a comet known as C/1861 G1, or Comet Thatcher, named for the amateur astronomer Alfred E. Thatcher, who first observed the comet in 1861.\n\nAfter its peak, the Lyrid meteor shower will continue to be on display until April 29."

            "content": "CNN —\n\nLongtime NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who has ventured to space four times, is due to return to Earth on Saturday night from the International Space Station. Pettit will turn 70 on Sunday.\n\nThe scientist invented the first object patented in space — called the Capillary Beverage, Space Cup or Zero-G cup, which makes it easier to drink beverages in the absence of gravity, and he is also a celebrated astrophotographer known for capturing unique views of the cosmos.\n\n“One of the things I like to do with my astrophotography is to have a composition and a perspective that’s different than an Earth-centric one, typically showing an Earth horizon with the atmosphere on edge, the limb, and then some kind of astronomy, astrophotography, in relationship to that,” Pettit said from the space station during an April 3 interview with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\nPettit said his photography is about the perspective of being in orbit.\n\n“Earth is amazingly beautiful when your feet are firmly planted on the ground, and it’s beautiful from space,” Pettit said. “And it’s hard to say what is more beautiful. I think it’s because space is a unique opportunity we seek to focus on the beauty of being in orbit. If we had people living their whole life in orbit, when they come down to Earth, they would probably think that was the most beautiful perspective they’d ever seen.”\n\nPettit takes his photos from the cupola on the space station, a favorite of crew members due to its seven windows that overlook Earth.\n\nHere are some of his most unforgettable views of what it’s like to live in space that he captured over the past seven months.\n\nThe Milky Way appears beyond Earth's horizon on February 3 in a photograph Pettit took using a camera with low light and long duration settings as the space station orbited 259 miles above the Coral Sea off the coast of the Australian state of Queensland. Don Pettit/NASA\n\nPettit, an avid astrophotographer, sets up camera hardware to photograph research activities inside the space station's Kibo laboratory module on March 15. NASA\n\nThis January 13 photo from Pettit depicts an array of celestial sights, including the Milky Way, zodiacal light, orbiting Starlink satellites and stars that resemble pinpoints of light. The burnt umber band showcases airglow — light from Earth's upper atmosphere — and Earth's atmosphere is seen on edge. The sun is also about to rise, and city lights from Earth appear as streaks. Don Pettit/NASA\n\nPettit witnesses SpaceX's uncrewed Starship 8 break apart in the upper atmosphere and fall back to Earth on March 6. Don Pettit/NASA\n\nThe Mediterranean Sea can be seen from the International Space Station. “Sun glint off the Mediterranean Sea (infrared and converted to black and white),\" Pettit described in an October 15 post on Instagram. \"When the sun reflects off the ocean, watery details unseen with normal lighting shows up. Small centimeter differences in ocean height become visible, revealing hidden currents.” Don Pettit/NASA\n\nPettit's 30-second exposure image showcases an unexplained green cast over the Pacific Ocean. Don Pettit/NASA\n\nSpace doesn't just appear dark to astronauts aboard the space station. They can also see stars, Pettit said. \"I flew a homemade tracking device that allows time exposures required to photograph star fields,\" Pettit said in a post on Instagram. Don Pettit/NASA\n\nA frame from a time-lapse video by Pettit shows thrusters firing on a SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft after it undocked and backed away from the station's forward port on the Harmony module. The orbital laboratory was soaring 259 miles above the Pacific Ocean west of Hawaii at the time. Don Pettit/NASA\n\nUsing a blank, white laptop display as the illuminator, a polarizing filter and the space station's freezer, Pettit grew thin wafers of water ice in microgravity, revealing colorful, fragmented ice crystals. The freezer sits at minus 140 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 95 degrees Celsius). Don Pettit/NASA\n\nPettit captures a stunning image of cosmic colors on January 27 as the sun begins to rise over the Pacific Ocean. This long-exposure image showcases the Milky Way above an aurora and airglow that shine closer to Earth’s horizon. Don Pettit/NASA\n\nIn October, Pettit and NASA astronaut Matthew Dominick were stunned to see that the space station was flying through auroras. \"We were not flying above the aurora; we were flying in the aurora,\" Pettit posted on Instagram. \"And it was blood red. Caught off guard, we hastily set up our cameras, four of them, all snapping shutters as fast as they could, creating a syncopated rhythm that accented Nature’s artistic display presented before us.\" Don Pettit/NASA\n\nPettit documents the way bright lightning reveals distant clouds over the Pacific Ocean on a dark night in November.

            "content": "Whether anything ever lived on Mars is unknown. And the present environment, with harsh temperatures, intense radiation, and a sparse atmosphere, isn’t exactly propitious for life. Despite the red planet’s brutality, lichens that inhabit some of the harshest environments on Earth could possibly survive there.\n\nLichens are symbionts, or two organisms that are in a cooperative relationship. There is a fungal component (most are about 90 percent fungus) and a photosynthetic component (algae or cyanobacteria). To see if some species of lichen had what it takes to survive on Mars, a team of researchers led by botanist Kaja Skubała used the Space Research Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences to expose the lichen species Diploschistes muscorum and Cetrarea aculeata to simulate Mars conditions.\n\n“Our study is the first to demonstrate that the metabolism of the fungal partner in lichen symbiosis was active while being in a Mars-like environment,” the researchers said in a study recently published in IMA Fungus. “X-rays associated with solar flares and SEPs reaching Mars should not affect the potential habitability of lichens on this planet.”\n\nMartian ionizing radiation is threatening to most forms of life because it can cause damage at the cellular level. It can also get in the way of physical, genetic, morphological, and biochemical processes, depending on the organism and radiation level.\n\nGoing to extremes\n\nLichens have an edge when it comes to survival. They share characteristics with other organisms that can handle high levels of stress, including a low metabolism, not needing much in the way of nutrition, and longevity. Much like tardigrades, lichens can stay in a desiccated state for extended periods until they are rehydrated. Other lichen adaptations to extreme conditions include metabolites that screen out UV rays and melanin pigments that also defend against radiation."

            "content": "In a recent deep-sea research expedition reported by Animals Around The Globe, scientists have identified what may be the oldest living fish ever recorded in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n\nThe discovery, centered around a species of rockfish, could rewrite the timelines of marine longevity and open new avenues in the science of aging and ecological conservation.\n\nThe Unexpected Discovery in the Abyss\n\nDuring a deep-sea survey in the Pacific Ocean, marine biologists encountered an individual from a long-lived species, later identified through morphological and genetic analysis as belonging to the Sebastes genus, commonly referred to as rockfish. These species are already known for their extreme lifespans, but this particular specimen appears to be unprecedented.\n\nUsing radiocarbon dating on the fish’s tissue samples—a method commonly applied to verify historical timelines in both archaeology and paleontology—researchers estimated the fish’s age at potentially over two centuries.\n\nRougheye Rockfish. Credit: Unsplash\n\nA Look at the Rougheye Rockfish\n\nThe rougheye rockfish (Sebastes aleutianus) is a prominent candidate for this record. This species, found in cold, deep waters from Japan to California, is already documented to live past 205 years. What makes the recent finding even more compelling is the remote and extreme nature of the environment it was discovered in.\n\nThese fish are easily recognized by their spiny dorsal fins and the roughly textured area beneath their eyes. More than a biological curiosity, they represent an extraordinary example of evolutionary resilience in one of Earth’s most hostile ecosystems.\n\nWhy Deep-sea Species Live So Long\n\nLong life in the ocean is often linked to a few recurring biological traits: slow growth, low metabolic rates, and stable environmental conditions. The newly discovered rockfish exhibits all of these.\n\nDue to the cold temperatures and low oxygen levels of deep-sea habitats, energy demands are minimized. Predation is less common at these depths, and competition for food is moderate, creating an ecological niche where longevity is a viable survival strategy.\n\nThese traits not only extend lifespan but also make the organism particularly valuable for studies on cellular aging, oxidative stress, and genetic stability.\n\nHidden Roles In Marine Ecosystems\n\nBeyond their age, rockfish play an important role in their ecosystem. As mid-level predators, they help regulate populations of smaller fish and invertebrates, maintaining a balance in the deep-sea food chain.\n\nTheir presence also supports larger marine predators, creating a chain of dependency that links many layers of the ecosystem. Studying ancient individuals like this one offers insight into population dynamics, reproductive cycles, and how species adapt to slow ecological changes over centuries.\n\nHuman Impact and the Urgency of Protection\n\nDespite their resilience, rockfish populations are not immune to human threats. The two biggest are overfishing and deep-sea trawling, both of which destroy habitats that take centuries to recover.\n\nFishing regulations across the Pacific, particularly in the US and Canada, have already started including species-specific quotas and depth restrictions, but enforcement varies. Without stronger international collaboration, such long-living species could vanish before they’re fully understood.\n\nClimate change adds further complications. Rising ocean temperatures, acidification, and decreasing oxygen levels could reduce the habitable zones for these cold-water species, threatening not just individuals but entire age-structured populations.\n\nMarine Reserves as Time Capsules\n\nOne of the most promising solutions lies in the expansion of marine protected areas (MPAs). These reserves act as ecological time capsules, where marine life can evolve and thrive undisturbed.\n\n\n\nResearch shows that MPAs not only support greater species diversity, but also increase average fish age and size, allowing for multi-generational data on species like Sebastes.\n\nIn areas where MPAs overlap with deep-sea habitats, long-lived species are more likely to survive and recover."

Credit: NASA\n\nA camera affixed to the International Space Station recently spotted some curious symbols amid a barren desert landscape.\n\n\"This caught our attention,\" Charles Black, the founder of the Earth and space livestreaming company Sen, told Mashable.\n\nSen has three cameras hosted on the space station, one of which peers straight down at our planet and covers a scene approximately 250 by 150 kilometers (155 by 93 miles) in size. (You can watch this view, live-streamed in high-resolution 4K video, online. 4K refers to a horizontal display of some 4,000 pixels, and is also known as Ultra High Definition or Ultra HD.) The recent footage shows what appears to be huge \"mysterious writing etched into the sand,\" the company explained.\n\nThe symbols are an example of the type of phenomena — both natural and human-created — revealed by the camera as the space station, located some 250 miles above Earth, zooms over us at 17,000 mph.\n\nThese letter-like patterns are in fact from agriculture activity, vividly contrasted by the barren desert plains in Tunisia, Black explained. But Sen doesn't always reveal exactly what its cameras observed. Are these farming areas irrigated into tracts from an aquifer? Or livestock grounds? What do you think?\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories? Sign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter. Loading...

We'll label the location, but we want the viewers to decide, discuss, and make comments.\"\n\nThe recent 4K video footage below, showing the writing-like symbols, is from April 15, 2025.\n\nAnyone with an internet connection can tune into Sen's footage. And they'll regularly see new sights. The space station orbits Earth about 16 times a day, and during each orbit the floating laboratory shifts a little to the west. \"Whenever you log on, you can see something different,\" Black said. \"You never know what you might see.\"\n\nGetting such cameras aboard the station is no simple feat. Sen's system had to pass Electromagnetic Interference, or EMI, testing, to ensure their camera activity wouldn't interfere with the station's communications and radio frequencies. The system had to pass three NASA safety reviews. And Sen had to find a host aboard the multinational, football field-length station. The cameras are hosted on a European Space Agency module aboard an Airbus platform, which provides both power and a share of a NASA downlink.\n\nThe space station, however, won't orbit Earth forever. It's slated to be carefully deorbited, via a SpaceX craft, into the atmosphere around 2030, where it will break apart and largely vaporize (the remaining pieces will plunge into the Pacific Ocean). So Sen is planning for future live-streamed cameras aboard other craft, including those further from our planet, allowing Earthlings a real-time global view of our humble, cosmic home.\n\nIf you tune into the current camera views, you'll spot sprawling cities like Las Vegas, snow-blanketed mountain ranges like the Rockies, the vivid aqua of Caribbean waters, and beyond.\n\n\"You see a beautiful planet and a borderless world,\" Black said."

            "content": "Scientists using NASA’s Curiosity rover have discovered siderite—an iron carbonate—in the sulfate-rich rocks of Gale Crater, solving a long-standing mystery about Mars’ missing carbonates.\n\nThis find provides powerful new clues about the planet’s ancient atmosphere and supports theories that it once harbored conditions suitable for liquid water. The discovery challenges previous satellite data and suggests that more carbon may be hidden below the Martian surface or lost to space.\n\nRethinking Mars’ Ancient Atmosphere\n\nScientists have long believed that Mars once had a thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and flowing liquid water on its surface. According to that theory, the CO 2 and water should have reacted with the planet’s rocks to form carbonate minerals. But until recently, surface analyses by rovers and orbital instruments using near-infrared spectroscopy hadn’t detected the expected levels of carbonate.\n\nNow, new findings reported in Science reveal otherwise. Data from three drill sites examined by NASA’s Curiosity rover show the presence of siderite—an iron-based carbonate mineral—within sulfate-rich rock layers on Mount Sharp, located in Gale Crater.\n\nA Surprising Find Beneath the Surface\n\n“The discovery of abundant siderite in Gale Crater represents both a surprising and important breakthrough in our understanding of the geologic and atmospheric evolution of Mars,” said Benjamin Tutolo, associate professor at the University of Calgary, Canada, and lead author of the paper.\n\nTo investigate the mineral composition of the Martian surface, Curiosity drills a few centimeters into the ground and collects powdered rock samples. These samples are analyzed by CheMin, an onboard instrument developed by NASA’s Ames Research Center. CheMin uses X-ray diffraction to determine the mineral structure of the rocks, with further analysis carried out by scientists at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nX-Ray Insights into Ancient Mars\n\n“Drilling through the layered Martian surface is like going through a history book,” said Thomas Bristow, research scientist at NASA Ames and coauthor of the paper. “Just a few centimeters down gives us a good idea of the minerals that formed at or close to the surface around 3.5 billion years ago.”\n\nThe discovery of this carbonate mineral in rocks beneath the surface suggests that carbonate may be masked by other minerals in near-infrared satellite analysis. If other sulfate-rich layers across Mars also contain carbonates, the amount of stored carbon dioxide would be a fraction of that needed in the ancient atmosphere to create conditions warm enough to support liquid water. The rest could be hidden in other deposits or have been lost to space over time.\n\nWhat’s Next for Mars Exploration\n\nIn the future, missions or analyses of other sulfate-rich areas on Mars could confirm these findings and help us better understand the planet’s early history and how it transformed as its atmosphere was lost.\n\nExplore Further: NASA’s Curiosity Rover Digs Up a Carbon Time Capsule on Mars\n\nReference: “Carbonates identified by the Curiosity rover indicate a carbon cycle operated on ancient Mars” by Benjamin M.

            "content": "4 years ago, Australian researchers at the CSIRO discovered that certain strains of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum were capable of extracting gold from their environment and incorporating it into their structure, thereby promoting their propagation. This discovery has led to growing interest in its potential application in the mining industry, particularly with regard to space exploration.\n\nThe role of fungi in gold extraction and applications\n\nTraditionally, fungi play a key role in the decomposition and recycling of organic matter, as well as in the cycling of certain metals such as aluminium, iron, manganese and calcium. However, the interaction with gold is particularly unusual due to the chemical inertia of this precious metal. As Tsing Bohu, the study‘s lead researcher, points out, gold is so chemically inactive that this type of interaction is unusual and surprising.\n\nThe Australian mining industry, the second largest gold producer in the world, quickly envisaged using these fungi to locate new gold deposits. The idea would be to analyse the soil for specific strains of Fusarium oxysporum in order to identify gold-rich areas. This approach is inspired by existing methods, such as the observation of eucalyptus trees or termite mounds, which are known to accumulate traces of gold.\n\nTowards space mining using micro-organisms\n\nBeyond terrestrial prospecting, the use of micro-organisms to extract precious metals is attracting particular interest in space mining. Companies are exploring the possibility of sending modified strains of these fungi or other micro-organisms into space to process minerals on site. This approach, known as metabolic mineralurgy, could revolutionise resource extraction. The aim is to simplify the process, particularly on celestial bodies such as asteroids. The idea is to bypass the many logistical and technological obstacles of conventional methods, which are often ill-suited to the extreme conditions of space.\n\nThe ability of fungi to metabolise gold opens up new prospects for both the terrestrial mining industry and future space exploration missions, offering potentially more sustainable and efficient methods of extracting precious metals."

            "content": "Researchers have identified a stable, gas-venting magma cap beneath Yellowstone, reducing eruption risk and advancing subsurface imaging techniques for broader geological applications.\n\nBeneath the steaming geysers and bubbling mud pots of Yellowstone National Park lies one of the world’s most closely monitored volcanic systems. A recent study, published in Nature, offers new insights into how this powerful system functions and what may prevent it from erupting.\n\nResearchers from Rice University, the University of New Mexico, the University of Utah, and the University of Texas at Dallas have identified a distinct, volatile-rich magma layer just 3.8 kilometers below Yellowstone’s surface. This layer acts as a cap, effectively trapping heat and pressure beneath it. Using advanced controlled-source seismic imaging and high-resolution computer modeling, the team found that the magma reservoir is actively releasing gases while remaining stable.\n\nThe study, led by Chenglong Duan and Brandon Schmandt of Rice University, sheds new light on the movement of magma, gases, and fluids within Earth’s crust. The research was supported by the National Science Foundation.\n\n“For decades, we’ve known there’s magma beneath Yellowstone, but the exact depth and structure of its upper boundary has been a big question,” said Schmandt, professor of Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences. “What we’ve found is that this reservoir hasn’t shut down — it’s been sitting there for a couple million years, but it’s still dynamic.”\n\nPrevious studies suggested the top of Yellowstone’s magma system could lie anywhere from 3 to 8 kilometers deep — an uncertainty that left geologists debating how the magma system today compares with conditions before prior eruptions.\n\nSeismic Imaging Brings New Clarity\n\nThat changed after Schmandt conducted a high-resolution seismic survey in the northeastern part of the caldera. A 53,000-pound vibroseis truck — typically used for oil and gas exploration — essentially generated tiny earthquakes to send seismic waves into the ground. These waves reflected off subsurface layers and were recorded at the surface, revealing a sharp boundary at about 3.8 km depth.\n\n“The motivation behind my research is to advance structural seismic imaging beyond the limits of conventional travel-time methods,” said Duan, a postdoctoral research associate. “Using a wave-equation imaging technique I developed during my Ph.D. for irregular seismic data, we made one of the first super clear images of the top of the magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone caldera.”\n\n“Seeing such a strong reflector at that depth was a surprise,” Schmandt said. “It tells us that something physically distinct is happening there — likely a buildup of partially molten rock interspersed with gas bubbles.”\n\nTo better understand what causes this signal, Duan and Schmandt modeled various rock, melt, and volatile combinations. The best match they determined is a mixture of silicate melt and supercritical water bubbles within a porous rock matrix resulting in a volatile-rich cap with about 14% porosity, half of which is occupied by fluid bubbles.\n\nAs magma rises and decompresses in volcanic systems, gases like water and carbon dioxide exsolve from the melt, forming bubbles. In some cases, these bubbles can accumulate, increasing buoyancy and potentially driving explosive eruptions.\n\nBut present conditions at Yellowstone appear to tell a different story.\n\n“Although we detected a volatile-rich layer, its bubble and melt contents are below the levels typically associated with imminent eruption,” Schmandt said. “Instead, it looks like the system is efficiently venting gas through cracks and channels between mineral crystals, which makes sense to me given Yellowstone’s abundant hydrothermal features emitting magmatic gases.”\n\nSchmandt likened the system to “steady breathing” with bubbles rising and releasing through the porous rock — a natural pressure-release valve that lowers eruption risk.\n\nChallenges in the Field and Data Lab\n\nGetting these results was anything but easy. The research team not only completed the field survey in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they also had to coordinate the project within a busy and carefully protected national park. This meant they could only operate the heavy vibroseis truck at night and only from designated roadside turnouts. More than 600 seismometers were temporarily deployed to record the vibroseis truck signals, then recovered a few weeks later. Collaboration with University of Utah professor Jamie Farrell, a Yellowstone geophysics expert and seismic network operator, was essential to making this unusual survey possible, Schmandt said.\n\nProcessing the data proved just as difficult. Yellowstone’s complex geology — known for scattering seismic waves — produced noisy data that were initially hard to interpret. But with persistence and many discussions with Schmandt, Duan said he kept going, refining his approach again and again until the numbers finally told a clear story.\n\n“The challenge was that the raw data made it almost impossible to visualize any reflection signals,” Duan said. “We used the STA/LTA function to enhance coherent seismic reflections, and this was the first time we had innovatively applied STA/LTA data within the wave-equation imaging algorithm.”\n\nDuan said that just like traversing the rocky landscape of Yellowstone, tenacity is key for navigating its mysteries underground.\n\n“When you see noisy, challenging data, don’t give up,” Duan said. “After we realized the standard processing was not going to work, that’s when we got creative and adapted our approach.”\n\nBy identifying this sharp, volatile-rich cap beneath Yellowstone, Schmandt’s team has established a new benchmark for monitoring the volcano’s activity. Future research could attempt to detect any shifts in melt content or gas accumulation that may serve as early warning signs of unrest.\n\nBeyond Yellowstone, the study offers broader insights into onshore subsurface imaging with potential applications not only for volcano monitoring but also for carbon storage, energy exploration and hazard assessment.\n\n“Being able to image what’s happening underground is important for everything from geothermal energy to storing carbon dioxide,” Schmandt said. “This work shows that with creativity and perseverance, we can see through complicated data and reveal what’s happening beneath our feet.”\n\nReference: “A sharp volatile-rich cap to the Yellowstone magmatic system” by Chenglong Duan, Wenkai Song, Brandon Schmandt, Jamie Farrell, David Lumley, Tobias Fischer, Lindsay Lowe Worthington and Fan-Chi Lin, 16 April 2025, Nature.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41586-025-08775-9"

            "content": "Although we tend to see mostly the glorious and fun parts of hanging out in a space station, the human body will not cease to do its usual things, whether it involves the digestive system, or even something as mundane as the hair that sprouts from our heads. After all, we do not want our astronauts to return to Earth after a half-year stay in the ISS looking as if they got marooned on an uninhabited island. Introducing the onboard barbershop on the ISS, and the engineering behind making sure that after a decade the ISS doesn’t positively look like it got the 1970s shaggy wall carpet treatment.\n\nThe basic solution is rather straightforward: an electric hair clipper attached to a vacuum that will whisk the clippings safely into a container rather than being allowed to drift around. In a way this is similar to the vacuums you find on routers and saws in a woodworking shop, just with more keratin rather than cellulose and lignin.\n\nOn the Chinese Tiangong space station they use a similar approach, with the video showing how simple the system is, little more than a small handheld vacuum cleaner attached to the clippers. Naturally, you cannot just tape the vacuum cleaner to some clippers and expect it to get most of the clippings, which is where both the ISS and Tiangong solutions seems to have a carefully designed construction to maximize the hair removal. You can see the ISS system in action in this 2019 video from the Canadian Space Agency.\n\nOf course, this system is not perfect, but amidst the kilograms of shed skin particles from the crew, a few small hair clippings can likely be handled by the ISS’ air treatment systems just fine. The goal after all is to not have a massive expanding cloud of hair clippings filling up the space station."

A new model could resolve that tension by making the universe spin very, very slowly.\n\nIn 1929, astronomer Edwin Hubble published a paper demonstrating that the universe is expanding . It gave rise to the Hubble constant , the number that describes how fast the universe is expanding.\n\nBut it eventually created a puzzle, called the Hubble tension, because this cosmic expansion differs depending on what cosmic objects are used to measure it.\n\nA new mathematical model could resolve the Hubble tension by assuming the universe rotates.\n\nRelated: After 2 years in space, the James Webb telescope has broken cosmology. Can it be fixed?\n\nThe new research, published in March in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , suggests that our universe completes one revolution every 500 billion years. This ultraslow rotation could resolve the discrepancy between different measurements of the Hubble constant.\n\n\"The standard concordance cosmological model has some wrinkles,\" study co-author István Szapudi , an astronomer at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, told Live Science in an email. \"A slow rotation of the universe could solve the Hubble puzzle.\"\n\nAstronomers measure the universe's rate of expansion in a few ways. One involves looking at supernovas — the explosive deaths of giant stars — and measuring how quickly these supernovas recede. The other method utilizes the cosmic microwave background, the radiation present 380,000 years following the Big Bang.

Other researchers, like Stephen Hawking , have also explored this theory. In the new study, the team applied the rotation to the Hubble tension. Because all celestial objects — including planets, stars, galaxies and black holes — rotate, this behavior naturally extends to the universe as a whole, the study authors proposed.\n\n\"Much to our surprise, we found that our model with rotation resolves the paradox without contradicting current astronomical measurements,\" Szapudi said.\n\nThe proposed glacial speed at which the universe may rotate is too slow to detect, but it would still affect the universe's expansion rate and does not require new physics.\n\nHowever, the model only incorporated some of the physics thought to be at play. \"We use Newtonian physics with some input from General Relativity,\" Szapudi said. \"A complete [General Relativity] treatment would be desirable.\"\n\nHe also explained that their work assumes the universe is uniform and did not vary in density as it evolved. In future investigations, the team will contrast the rotating-universe model against other cosmological models."

            "content": "Image credits: Canva\n\nBetween Greenland and Canada\n\n\n\nStranded continent\n\n\n\nHow was the proto-microcontinent formed?\n\n\n\nResearch reveals shocking discoveries\n\n\n\nIn a surprising discovery, scientists have found a long-lost continental fragment buried beneath the thick ice of Greenland. This previously unfound microcontinent formed tens of millions of years ago is believed to be a part of a complex tectonic rift system between Greenland and Canada.Along with redefining the geological map of the North Atlantic, the continent's discovery also expands our understanding of plate tectonic reorganisation, continental separation and how fragments of ancient crust were stranded during the birth of new oceans.The region separating Canada and Greenland has long been one of high interest due to its complex geological conditions. It is here the Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay connect via the Davis Strait, a region formed by tectonic activity during the Paleogene period, roughly between 61-33 million years ago.During this time, Earth's crust began to break apart, initiating a period of rifting and seafloor spreading.According to researchers, this portion of continental crust, about 19-24 kilometres deep, was not fully separated and thus became stranded beneath the ocean floor.Now, this continental block is known as the Davis Strait proto-microcontinent , a term being used to describe a slab of continental lithosphere that is neither fully connected nor fully detached from a major landmass.Scientists used gravity maps and seismic imaging to identify the structure and orientation of faults in the region. The data pointed to a change in the direction of seafloor spreading that occurred around 49-58 million years ago. This move from a northeast-southwest axis to a more north-south alignment played a vital role in the place of the proto-microcontinent.When the ocean spreading in the region stopped around 33 million years ago, Greenland collided with Ellesmere Island and became a part of the North American plate. This was the last tectonic motion in the area, thus finalising the proto-microcontinent's place beneath the ocean and at the edge of Greenland's western coast.In a study published in Gondwana Research Fr. Jordan Phethean, doctoral researcher Luke Longley from the University of Derby and Dr Christian Schiffer of Uppsala University, revealed that the area's isolated tectonic history made it a premium location to study the formation of microcontinents.They explained that these proto-microcontinents are “regions of relatively thick continental lithosphere separated from major continents by a zone of thinner continental lithosphere.” The rifting and microcontinent formation help to predict the future evolution of the planet's surface. They emphasize that such structures are not just geological curiosities — they hold the key to understanding how Earth’s crust breaks and reforms through time."

            "description": "The exoplanet K2-18b could harbor a massive ocean, but scientists will need to study the planet more to see if it’s really likely to host life.",
            "content": "A team of astronomers announced on April 16, 2025, that in the process of studying a planet around another star, they had found evidence for an unexpected atmospheric gas. On Earth, that gas – called dimethyl sulfide – is mostly produced by living organisms.\n\nIn April 2024, the James Webb Space Telescope stared at the host star of the planet K2-18b for nearly six hours. During that time, the orbiting planet passed in front of the star. Starlight filtered through its atmosphere, carrying the fingerprints of atmospheric molecules to the telescope.\n\nBy comparing those fingerprints to 20 different molecules that they would potentially expect to observe in the atmosphere, the astronomers concluded that the most probable match was a gas that, on Earth, is a good indicator of life.\n\nI am an astronomer and astrobiologist who studies planets around other stars and their atmospheres. In my work, I try to understand which nearby planets may be suitable for life.\n\nK2-18b, a mysterious world\n\nTo understand what this discovery means, let’s start with the bizarre world it was found in. The planet’s name is K2-18b, meaning it is the first planet in the 18th planetary system found by the extended NASA Kepler mission, K2. Astronomers assign the “b” label to the first planet in the system, not “a,” to avoid possible confusion with the star.\n\nK2-18b is a little over 120 light-years from Earth – on a galactic scale, this world is practically in our backyard.\n\nAlthough astronomers know very little about K2-18b, we do know that it is very unlike Earth. To start, it is about eight times more massive than Earth, and it has a volume that’s about 18 times larger. This means that it’s only about half as dense as Earth. In other words, it must have a lot of water, which isn’t very dense, or a very big atmosphere, which is even less dense.\n\nAstronomers think that this world could either be a smaller version of our solar system’s ice giant Neptune, called a mini-Neptune, or perhaps a rocky planet with no water but a massive hydrogen atmosphere, called a gas dwarf.\n\nAnother option, as University of Cambridge astronomer Nikku Madhusudhan recently proposed, is that the planet is a “hycean world.”\n\nThat term means hydrogen-over-ocean, since astronomers predict that hycean worlds are planets with global oceans many times deeper than Earth’s oceans, and without any continents. These oceans are covered by massive hydrogen atmospheres that are thousands of miles high.\n\nAstronomers do not know yet for certain that hycean worlds exist, but models for what those would look like match the limited data JWST and other telescopes have collected on K2-18b.\n\nThis is where the story becomes exciting. Mini-Neptunes and gas dwarfs are unlikely to be hospitable for life, because they probably don’t have liquid water, and their interior surfaces have enormous pressures. But a hycean planet would have a large and likely temperate ocean. So could the oceans of hycean worlds be habitable – or even inhabited?\n\nDetecting DMS\n\nIn 2023, Madhusudhan and his colleagues used the James Webb Space Telescope’s short-wavelength infrared camera to inspect starlight that filtered through K2-18b’s atmosphere for the first time.\n\nThey found evidence for the presence of two simple carbon-bearing molecules – carbon monoxide and methane – and showed that the planet’s upper atmosphere lacked water vapor. This atmospheric composition supported, but did not prove, the idea that K2-18b could be a hycean world. In a hycean world, water would be trapped in the deeper and warmer atmosphere, closer to the oceans than the upper atmosphere probed by JWST observations.\n\nIntriguingly, the data also showed an additional, very weak signal. The team found that this weak signal matched a gas called dimethyl sulfide, or DMS. On Earth, DMS is produced in large quantities by marine algae. It has very few, if any, nonbiological sources.\n\nThis signal made the initial detection exciting: on a planet that may have a massive ocean, there is likely a gas that is, on Earth, emitted by biological organisms.\n\nScientists had a mixed response to this initial announcement. While the findings were exciting, some astronomers pointed out that the DMS signal seen was weak and that the hycean nature of K2-18b is very uncertain.\n\nTo address these concerns, Mashusudhan’s team turned JWST back to K2-18b a year later. This time, they used another camera on JWST that looks for another range of wavelengths of light. The new results – announced on April 16, 2025 – supported their initial findings.\n\nThese new data show a stronger – but still relatively weak – signal that the team attributes to DMS or a very similar molecule. The fact that the DMS signal showed up on another camera during another set of observations made the interpretation of DMS in the atmosphere stronger.\n\nMadhusudhan’s team also presented a very detailed analysis of the uncertainties in the data and interpretation. In real-life measurements, there are always some uncertainties. They found that these uncertainties are unlikely to account for the signal in the data, further supporting the DMS interpretation. As an astronomer, I find that analysis exciting.\n\nIs life out there?\n\nDoes this mean that scientists have found life on another world? Perhaps – but we still cannot be sure.\n\nFirst, does K2-18b really have an ocean deep beneath its thick atmosphere? Astronomers should test this.\n\nSecond, is the signal seen in two cameras two years apart really from dimethyl sulfide? Scientists will need more sensitive measurements and more observations of the planet’s atmosphere to be sure.\n\nThird, if it is indeed DMS, does this mean that there is life? This may be the most difficult question to answer. Life itself is not detectable with existing technology. Astronomers will need to evaluate and exclude all other potential options to build their confidence in this possibility.\n\nThe new measurements may lead researchers toward a historic discovery. However, important uncertainties remain. Astrobiologists will need a much deeper understanding of K2-18b and similar worlds before they can be confident in the presence of DMS and its interpretation as a signature of life.\n\nScientists around the world are already scrutinizing the published study and will work on new tests of the findings, since independent verification is at the heart of science.\n\nMoving forward, K2-18b is going to be an important target for JWST, the world’s most sensitive telescope. JWST may soon observe other potential hycean worlds to see if the signal appears in the atmospheres of those planets, too.\n\nWith more data, these tentative conclusions may not stand the test of time. But for now, just the prospect that astronomers may have detected gasses emitted by an alien ecosystem that bubbled up in a dark, blue-hued alien ocean is an incredibly fascinating possibility.\n\nRegardless of the true nature of K2-18b, the new results show how using the JWST to survey other worlds for clues of alien life will guarantee that the next years will be thrilling for astrobiologists."

            "content": "The phenomenon of “bleeding glaciers” has recently captured scientific attention, revealing a disturbing ecological warning sign. These massive ice formations, once pristine white monuments of nature, now display alarming red patches that researchers compare to blood. This unsettling transformation signals deeper environmental issues that merit urgent consideration as our planet faces unprecedented climate challenges.\n\nThe mysterious red coloration transforming glaciers worldwide\n\nThe eerie red stains appearing on glaciers, often called “watermelon snow” or “glacier blood,” result from microscopic algae blooms. The primary culprit is Chlamydomonas nivalis, an organism that thrives as temperatures rise during summer months in polar regions. These tiny life forms produce a distinctive red pigment as a protective mechanism against harsh ultraviolet radiation.\n\nScientists from the University of the Basque Country have documented increasing occurrences of this phenomenon. José Ignacio García, a leading researcher in the field, warns that these blooms directly correlate with warming trends. The red coloration isn’t merely a visual curiosity – it represents a dangerous feedback loop in the global climate crisis that continues to break CO₂ level records.\n\nA comprehensive study from Simon Fraser University revealed these algae now cover up to 65% of certain glaciers in North America’s northwest regions. This widespread presence has transformed from an isolated observation into a significant climate indicator that scientists monitor closely.\n\nHow glacier formation occurs and why their loss matters\n\nGlaciers form through centuries of snow accumulation in regions where winter snowfall exceeds summer melt. This compressed snow gradually transforms into dense ice under its own weight, creating massive structures that slowly flow downhill due to gravity. These majestic ice formations primarily develop in frigid, high-altitude environments like the Himalayas, Arctic, Alps, and Antarctica.\n\nThese ice giants serve as vital components of Earth’s ecosystem. They act as natural reservoirs, storing approximately 69% of our planet’s freshwater. Additionally, glaciers function as geological sculptors, carving valleys and creating dramatic landscapes through their constant movement.\n\nBeyond their physical presence, glaciers provide critical climate data. Scientists analyze ice cores extracted from ancient glaciers to understand atmospheric composition throughout history. This information helps establish baseline climate patterns, making the current rapid retreat especially alarming – similar to how researchers have identified mechanisms accelerating species collapse in other ecosystems.\n\nThe dangerous feedback loop accelerating ice melt\n\nThe reddening of glaciers creates a perilous cycle that accelerates their destruction. Clean white snow naturally reflects most solar radiation back into space – a property scientists call “albedo.” When algae bloom, turning the surface red or pink, this reflective capacity dramatically decreases.\n\nDarker surfaces absorb more solar energy, raising surface temperatures and increasing melt rates. The resulting meltwater creates ideal conditions for more algal growth, further darkening the surface. This continuous cycle forms a self-reinforcing pattern of accelerating glacier loss that worries climate scientists.\n\nThis process mirrors other concerning planetary developments, such as how massive cosmic phenomena like approaching black holes capture scientific attention. While operating on vastly different scales, both represent profound forces reshaping their environments.\n\nRecent research indicates these algal blooms may become more frequent and intense as global temperatures rise. Scientists are now developing monitoring systems to track these blooms, similar to how advanced telescopes observe distant astronomical phenomena.\n\nThe wider implications for Earth’s climate future\n\nThe “bleeding glacier” phenomenon represents more than a localized issue – it symbolizes broader planetary changes. As these ancient ice formations disappear, sea levels rise, threatening coastal communities worldwide. Freshwater supplies diminish for regions dependent on glacial melt, potentially triggering resource conflicts.\n\nGlacier retreat also disrupts marine ecosystems by altering ocean temperatures and circulation patterns. These changes ripple throughout food webs, affecting species from microscopic plankton to apex predators. The rapid transformation of these environments recalls discoveries of ancient ocean ecosystems, like prehistoric deep-sea predators that dominated ancient oceans.\n\nScientists emphasize that this red warning sign demands immediate attention. By understanding these algal blooms and their relationship to climate change, researchers hope to develop strategies to mitigate their impact and preserve these critical ice formations for future generations."

            "content": "Therapsids, the ancient ancestors of mammals, were integral to Earth’s ecosystems during the middle to late Permian period. (CREDIT: Bruce Aleksander / Flickr)\n\nTherapsids, the ancient relatives of mammals, once roamed Earth in great numbers during the middle to late Permian period. These land-dwelling creatures would later evolve into mammals, but their earliest history has long remained unclear.\n\nA striking fossil discovery on the island of Mallorca is now rewriting that timeline. It adds crucial detail to the story of how mammals and their distant ancestors first emerged.\n\nUnearthed in the Mediterranean, this fossil belongs to a gorgonopsian—a fierce predator from the therapsid lineage. Researchers have dated the remains to 270–280 million years ago, making it the oldest gorgonopsian ever found and possibly the earliest known therapsid.\n\n\"It is most likely the oldest gorgonopsian on the planet,\" says Josep Fortuny, senior author of the study and head of the Computational Biomechanics and Evolution of Life History group at the Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont.\n\nSkeleton of Inostrancevia alexandri at the Museo delle Scienze, Trento, Italy. (CREDIT: Matteo De Stefano/MUSE/CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nTherapsids formed a wide-ranging group of four-legged animals, with only mammals surviving today. During the late Paleozoic, they played a major role in life on land, long before dinosaurs appeared.\n\nUntil this find, the oldest confirmed therapsid was Raranimus dashankouensis, dating back 265 million years to the Roadian stage of the Permian. Yet for decades, researchers have believed that therapsids split from their closest relatives, the sphenacodontid synapsids, as far back as 320 million years ago. That left a 40-million-year hole in the fossil record—what paleontologists call a “ghost lineage.”\n\nThe fossil remains in Mallorca start to close that gap. Scientists uncovered skull fragments, ribs, vertebrae, and a femur in rock that once formed part of Pangaea, the giant supercontinent of the Permian era.\n\n\"The large number of bone remains is surprising,\" says Rafel Matamales, curator of the Museu Balear de Ciències Naturals and lead author of the study. \"When we started this excavation, we never thought we would find so many remains of an animal of this type in Mallorca.\"\n\nThe gorgonopsian discovered in Mallorca was a saber-toothed predator, resembling a medium-sized dog in build but differing significantly in appearance.\n\n\"If you saw this animal walking down the street, it would look a little bit like a husky, but it wouldn’t be quite right,\" explains Ken Angielczyk, co-author of the study and a curator at the Field Museum. \"It didn’t have fur or dog-like ears, but it had long, blade-like canine teeth.\"\n\nThese saber teeth indicate the gorgonopsian’s role as a top predator in its ecosystem. This discovery not only extends the known timeline of gorgonopsians but also challenges long-held assumptions about the pace and geography of therapsid evolution.\n\nThe fossil suggests that major therapsid groups diversified rapidly, within a span of less than 10 million years following Olson’s Extinction, a lesser-known mass extinction event that preceded the Permian-Triassic extinction.\n\nA life reconstruction of what may be the oldest known gorgonopsian. The prehistoric predator is known from 280-270-million-year-old fossils found in Mallorca, Spain.

Most Permian therapsid fossils have been found in the Cis-Urals of Russia and southern Africa, regions representing northern and southern paleotemperate latitudes.\n\nIn contrast, the early Permian formations of North America and Europe, which correspond to paleotropical ecosystems, have yielded few definitive therapsid fossils. The discovery in Mallorca provides a crucial link between these regions and helps clarify the spatiotemporal dynamics of therapsid evolution.\n\nThe evolutionary significance of therapsids lies in their unique anatomical features, which bridge the gap between reptiles and mammals. Early therapsids displayed characteristics such as a hole on the sides of their skulls for jaw muscle attachment and structures on their jawbones that would later evolve into mammals’ middle ear bones.\n\n“Gorgonopsians are more closely related to mammals than they are to any other living animals,” notes Angielczyk. While not direct ancestors of mammals, gorgonopsians are closely related to the species that eventually gave rise to them.\n\nMost relevant elements of DA21/17-01-01 and silhouette showing their positions.

Emerging statistical models, such as relaxed clock models, have enabled researchers to estimate a more precise timeline for therapsid evolution.\n\nThese models suggest that therapsids experienced an evolutionary radiation in the aftermath of Olson’s Extinction, leading to the emergence of all major therapsid clades within a remarkably short period.\n\nThis finding is particularly significant in understanding mammalian origins. \"Before the time of dinosaurs, there was an age of ancient mammal relatives,\" Angielczyk explains. \"Most of those ancient mammal relatives looked really different from what we think of mammals looking like today. But they were really diverse and played lots of different ecological roles.\"\n\nThe fossil record is a puzzle with many missing pieces, but discoveries like the one in Mallorca help complete the picture. The gorgonopsian fossil not only extends the known history of therapsids but also underscores the importance of paleotropical regions in early Permian ecosystems.\n\nGeological context of the gorgonopsian from Mallorca.

            "content": "A magnetic collapse 41,000 years ago let in solar radiation, changed the skies, and possibly shaped the fate of early humans. (CREDIT: DepositPhotos)\n\nDuring a brief but dramatic chapter in Earth's history about 41,000 years ago, the planet’s magnetic field nearly collapsed. What followed was a cascade of environmental and biological changes that may have shaped the course of human evolution.\n\nThis period, called the Laschamps excursion, lasted around 2,000 years. The strength of Earth’s magnetic field dropped to just 10% of its current level, while the magnetic poles wandered far from their usual locations.\n\nFor about 300 years, the magnetic field tilted and weakened rapidly, behaving more like the multipolar magnetic fields of outer planets. This sudden shift allowed high-energy particles from the Sun to pierce the atmosphere more easily, threatening life on the ground and transforming the skies.\n\nA Shield Under Stress\n\nEarth’s magnetic field has long served as a vital shield against the harshness of space. Generated by the flow of molten iron in the outer core, this field forms the magnetosphere—a vast bubble that deflects charged particles from the Sun. This protective layer allows Earth to maintain an atmosphere, prevents ozone loss, and supports life.\n\nUniversity of Michigan researcher Agnit Mukhopadhyay reconstructed what the magnetic field around Earth may have looked like during the Laschamps excursion, a time period between 42,200 and 41,500 years ago when the north and south poles wandered from their geographic locations. (CREDIT: Agnit Mukhopadhyay, University of Michigan)\n\nAs charged particles stream toward the planet in what’s known as the solar wind, the magnetosphere bends and stretches. On the dayside, it is compressed; on the nightside, it stretches into a long tail. These dynamic processes trap and accelerate particles, creating a space plasma environment extending tens to hundreds of Earth radii.\n\nIn the polar regions, the interaction between this plasma and the atmosphere gives rise to auroras—those flickering bands of green, red, and purple that light up the polar skies. The magnetic field also shields critical technology, including communication satellites and power grids, from the impacts of space weather.\n\nBut this shield is not constant. Over millions of years, it has wobbled, weakened, and even flipped direction entirely during events called geomagnetic reversals. Sometimes, instead of a full flip, the field experiences shorter, more rapid changes. These are known as geomagnetic excursions.\n\nThe Laschamps Excursion and a Planet in Flux\n\nThe most recent of these excursions—the Laschamps event—was first recorded in lava flows and sediment deposits. During this episode, the magnetic field lost much of its strength and coherence. Poles wandered unpredictably, the protective bubble around the planet weakened, and space plasma patterns changed drastically.\n\nRecent research led by Agnit Mukhopadhyay at the University of Michigan offers new insights into what Earth looked like during this time. Using advanced computer models, Mukhopadhyay and his team recreated a three-dimensional view of Earth’s magnetic environment during the Laschamps excursion. This model connected three layers of the system: the geomagnetic field, the space plasma, and the auroral regions.\n\nThe team discovered that the weakened field allowed auroras to appear not just near the poles but over much of Europe and even parts of northern Africa. Magnetic field lines stretched outward, and more solar radiation reached the ground. This increase in radiation likely had major effects on Earth’s atmosphere, possibly altering its chemistry and circulation patterns.\n\nMap of the combined coverage of the auroral oval (yellow-shaded area) and open field line regions (gray-filled) throughout the Laschamps event. (CREDIT: Science Advances)\n\nMore cosmic rays and ultraviolet light would have reached the surface, posing a threat to living organisms. This exposure might have driven humans and animals to adapt quickly—or disappear.\n\nHuman Responses in a Shifting World\n\nAround the time of the Laschamps excursion, Homo sapiens and Neanderthals coexisted in Europe. But shortly after, Neanderthals vanished. Could changes in the magnetic field have played a role?\n\nMukhopadhyay, along with anthropologist Raven Garvey and a global team of researchers, began piecing together clues from archaeology, geology, and climate science. Their work, published in Science Advances, connects the weakening magnetic field with a spike in human behavioral changes.\n\nOne key adaptation may have been clothing. Archaeological evidence from Homo sapiens sites shows the use of needles, awls, and scrapers—tools likely used to make tailored garments. Unlike simple animal hides, fitted clothes offered more protection from both cold and solar radiation. Garvey points out that tailored clothing allowed people to travel farther from shelter and may have provided an unintended benefit: a barrier against damaging ultraviolet rays.\n\nVisualization of auroral charged particle energy flux variations and corresponding auroral zone wandering during the Laschamps excursion. (CREDIT: Science Advances)\n\nThere’s also evidence that Homo sapiens began using ochre more frequently around this time. This naturally occurring pigment, rich in iron oxide, has long been used by human ancestors to decorate skin, tools, and cave walls. But experiments have shown that ochre also blocks ultraviolet radiation. It may have functioned as a prehistoric sunscreen.\n\n“We found that many of those regions actually match pretty closely with early human activity from 41,000 years ago,” said Mukhopadhyay. “Specifically an increase in the use of caves and an increase in the use of prehistoric sunscreen.”\n\nNeanderthals, by contrast, show little evidence of such adaptations. They lacked the tools for fitted clothing and may not have used ochre as sunscreen. Without these protective strategies, they might have been more vulnerable to solar radiation.\n\nWhere the Skies Lit Up\n\nTo model how the skies may have changed, Mukhopadhyay used the Space Weather Modeling Framework—an advanced system developed at the University of Michigan. This tool simulates the interaction between solar plasma and planetary magnetic fields.\n\nWorking with Sanja Panovska at Germany’s GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences, the team created a detailed map of the Earth’s space environment during the Laschamps event. This model showed where magnetic field lines opened up and where radiation could penetrate to the ground.\n\nThe auroras that we now associate with the Arctic and Antarctic likely stretched far into temperate regions. In fact, during the Laschamps excursion, much of Europe would have glowed with colorful, shifting lights. But this beauty came with danger. With the magnetic field so weak, radiation levels soared.\n\nVariations in Earth’s internal magnetic field during the Laschamps Event. (CREDIT: Science Advances)\n\nGarvey emphasized that solar radiation doesn’t just cause sunburns. It can lead to severe eye damage and reduce levels of folate, a vital vitamin needed for healthy pregnancies. “Having protection against solar radiation would also have conferred significant advantage to anyone who possessed it,” she said.\n\nWhat the Past Tells Us About the Future\n\nMukhopadhyay’s model doesn’t just shed light on the past—it also offers a warning. If an event like the Laschamps excursion happened today, modern society could be in serious trouble.\n\n“Our communication satellites would not work,” said Mukhopadhyay. “Many of our telecommunication arrays, which are on the ground, would be severely affected by the smallest of space weather events.”\n\nThe power grid could be at risk. Navigation systems would be unreliable. Radiation levels would rise, especially at high altitudes, affecting air travel. This research highlights the importance of understanding how magnetic field fluctuations could impact daily life.\n\nThere’s also a lesson for planetary science. Many astronomers believe a strong magnetic field is a requirement for life. But events like the Laschamps excursion show that life on Earth endured even when the field was weak. Studying these moments helps scientists rethink the conditions needed for life on other worlds.\n\nAs Mukhopadhyay puts it, “Looking at prehistoric Earth, and especially at events like this, helps us study exoplanetary physics from a very different vantage point. Life did exist back then. But it was a little bit different than it is today.”\n\nNote: The article above provided above by The Brighter Side of News."

            "description": "\"All four instruments are functioning as designed.\"",
            "content": "Scientists announced on Friday (April 18) that the newest solar investigator in town has captured its first-light images — or should I say the newest solar investigators. That is, this NASA sun-studying mission, named PUNCH, is technically made up of four small satellites that are strategically distributed in our planet's orbit. The quartet is designed, however, to work together as a single instrument with the power to decode some of our star's biggest mysteries.\n\n\"All four instruments are functioning as designed. We're excited to finish on-orbit commissioning and get these cameras working together,\" Craig DeForest, at the Solar System Science and Exploration Division of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado, said in a statement.\n\nWhat you're seeing in these images is a bunch of stars, visible as faint sparkles against a dark sky, enshrouded by a soft amber haze. This lovely luminescence is known as the \"zodiacal light,\" which is a diffuse glow created by dust particles orbiting the sun reflecting sunlight toward Earth. If you look closely at the stars, there are even some constellations visible in the scene, like Taurus and Cetus. However, if all goes to plan, PUNCH's future cosmic images won't have any stars at all — or any zodiacal light, for that matter.\n\nThe ultimate purpose of PUNCH is to use its four instruments — three wide-field imagers (WFI) and a near-field imager (NFI) — to isolate features found within the solar wind. This is because one of the big sun mysteries that the mission aims to solve is the puzzle of how the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, turns into the solar wind.\n\nIf you can imagine an invisible bubble around our cosmic neighborhood, aka the barrier between our solar system and the rest of the universe, that entire bubble is filled with streams of charged particles released from the solar corona. The filling of that bubble is the solar wind, and the bubble itself is known as the heliosphere.\n\nBut to come to conclusions about the transition between solar corona, the solar wind and the heliosphere, scientists need to isolate extremely faint features within all the solar material — and to isolate those features, there can't be any interference like background stars or zodiacal light.\n\nOn April 14, PUNCH opened the doors of two instruments, collecting this first-light image and demonstrating the cameras are in focus, working properly and capturing deep-field images of the “night” sky against the “noontime” glare of space. Several familiar constellations are visible, including Taurus (just right of top center) and the Pleiades (upper right). (Image credit: NASA/SwRI)\n\n\"Throughout the commissioning phase, the PUNCH team is calibrating the NFI data to remove 99% of the light to show materials streaming out from the sun's outer atmosphere in stunning detail,\" DeForest said. \"The three WFI 'first-light' images show star fields, but the ultimate goal is to remove the star field and other background light and preserve the faint glimmer of the solar wind as it travels to Earth.\"\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhat these first-light images prove, however, is that the instruments are usable and working in such a way that this process can happen. According to the statement, one NFI and one WFI were activated on April 14, and the other two NFIs were activated on April 16.\n\nThis composite of first-light images taken April 14 by PUNCH/WFI2 (top) and PUNCH/NFI (inset) shows how the fields of view fit together. When the four NASA spacecraft are fully deployed, they will work together to view a field 90 degrees across. Constellations have been identified to show the size of the field of view. (Image credit: NASA/SwRI)\n\nOnce everything seems to be going well, we'll hopefully get a look into how PUNCH is meant to take advantage of a property of light called polarization.\n\n\"A polarimeter is a camera that can measure polarized light like you might see through a pair of polarized sunglasses, and we use that to measure what we're imaging in three dimensions,\" DeForest previously explained in a press conference. \"As we look at the solar wind, we're looking at sunlight that's scattered off the actual material that we're seeing. That scattering process polarizes the light, and the degree of polarization tells us where the object was in three dimensions.\"\n\nFurthermore, it would appear that during the PUNCH mission's 90-day commissioning period, the team managed to demonstrate the capabilities of new \"water-powered, shot-glass-sized\" rocket engines. These engines, which the team says can carry safe and nontoxic propellant, work by the spacecraft passing an electric current through water to create stores of high-pressure hydrogen and oxygen. That hydrogen and oxygen can then burn as fuel when the team needs to correct any of the spacecrafts' trajectories.\n\nDeForest says the \"safety and stability\" of this propulsion system is worth it, likely because, as the statement explains, each of the satellites will need to maneuver hundreds of times to maintain proper position.\n\nPUNCH launched on March 11, sharing a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket ride to Earth orbit with NASA's SPHEREx mission (which is basically like a wide-angle James Webb Space Telescope). After PUNCH's commissioning phase finally comes to a close, the team says we should be seeing scientific information start pouring out this summer; data analysis is set to begin in June."

            "description": "According to a recent study by the non-profit Explore Titan, a nuclear-fission propulsion spacecraft could enable the first crewed mission to Titan, Saturn's largest moon.",
            "content": "Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has been a source of mystery ever since scientists got their first up-close look at it in 1979 with the Pioneer 11 probe. The mystery has only deepened as additional spacecraft, like the Voyager probes and the Cassini-Huygens mission, acquired better images and more data on this moon. In addition to being the only body other than Earth to have a dense, nitrogen-rich atmosphere, Titan also has a methanogenic cycle similar to Earth's water cycle. On top of that, it has a rich prebiotic environment and organic chemistry on its surface.\n\nThese properties have fueled speculation that life may exist on Titan, possibly in the form of simple life forms that dwell within its vast methane lakes. This is also why NASA is developing the Dragonfly mission, a nuclear-powered quadcopter that will begin exploring Titan's atmosphere and surface in 2034. But what about crewed missions to Titan? According to a recent study by Explore Titan, a nuclear-fission propulsion spacecraft could enable the first crewed mission to the outer Solar System.\n\nThe study was conducted by William O'Hara and Marcos Fernandez-Tous. O'Hara is a researcher from the University of North Dakota, the Lunar Habitat Formulation Lead & Technical Program Director at Blue Origin, and an engineering consultant at Explore Titan, Inc. Fernandez-Tous is an Assistant Professor of Space Studies at the University of North Dakota. The paper describing their concept was submitted to the 56th Lunar Planetary Science Conference (LPSC 2025) that took place in The Woodlands, Texas, back in March.\n\nSince NASA launched the Constellation Program in 2005, its long-term aim has been to resume sending humans beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This would consist of a stepping-stone strategy, starting with the first crewed missions to the Moon during the Apollo Era. This was to be followed by the creation of infrastructure in deep space that would enable missions to Mars and beyond. Since transit times to Mars could take between 6 and 9 months, multiple space agencies are investigating propulsion methods that could make the trip faster.\n\nExplore Titan is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering a dialogue about where this momentum should lead humankind after Mars. Essentially, they hope to extend the Moon to Mars approach to include Titan in the near future. As they state in their proposal paper:\n\n\"Of the possible candidates, Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is the obvious candidate. Explore Titan proposes the next mantra beyond Moon-to-Mars to be Mars-to-Titan, where technology developed for human missions to Mars could be extended or evolved for use in missions to Titan.\"\n\nHowever, the distance between Earth and Titan is far greater than between Earth and Mars—approximately 8.5 astronomical units (AU) vs. 0.5 AU. As a result, transit times must be significantly reduced to ensure the crew spends a minimum amount of time in microgravity and is exposed to less cosmic radiation. Research into nuclear propulsion can be divided into two broad categories: nuclear-thermal propulsion (NTP) and nuclear-electric propulsion (NEP).\n\nFor their study, the team assessed the feasibility of NTP and NEP options for a hypothetical human-class mission to Titan with transit times of one to two years (one-way). They then evaluated the total mass of these systems (engines and propellant) and their resulting impact on spacecraft design. This began with the NTP concept outlined in NASA's Design Reference Architecture 5.0 (DRA 5.0), which describes a 56.25 metric ton (62 U.S. ton) crew-capable spacecraft that utilizes a uranium-235 reactor and hydrogen propellant to achieve a two-way mission to Mars in about 375 days.\n\nCombined with surface operations of 540 days and an optimal launch window, this mission would last two and a half years. A mission of this duration would pose significant risks for crew health, especially when extended for missions to Titan. They also considered \"Copernicus,\" the larger NTP concept proposed in a 2013 study led by NASA Glenn scientist Stanley K. Borowski. This vehicle would have a 172 metric ton (190 U.S. ton) propellant capacity and could reduce one-way transit times to 150 to 220 days.\n\nHowever, the authors note that \"predictions have shown that even this deep space mission duration may exceed allowable limits for crew exposure to cosmic radiation.\" While the Copernicus could conceivably reduce one-way transits to 90 days by adding more propellant tanks, this would considerably increase the spacecraft's mass and cost. They also considered the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) concept proposed by the Ad Astra rocket company.\n\nThis concept relies on a nuclear magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) reactor to power an electric thruster. According to a study by Franklin Diaz et al., incorporating this engine could reduce transit times to 149 days. Last, they considered the 2020 study by Marco Gajeri et al. that proposes how a Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) could enable a robotic mission to Titan that would take 2 to 2.6 years to achieve a round-trip. Properly adapted and optimized for a human-rated mission, these concepts could enable the next great leap in human space exploration. As the team summarized:\n\n\"From this review, we conclude that nuclear space propulsion systems may be the key enabler for future missions to Titan. For human missions, given the health risks of deep space human spaceflight, it could be the most critical element to their success.\"\n\nFurther Reading: USRA"

            "content": "Countless species of insects have been around for hundreds of millions of years, including pests like cockroaches and beetles. More specifically, the rove beetle (Staphylinidae) — which has over 66,000 species — dates as far back as dinosaurs. This beetle has learned to thrive by adapting to its environment and exploiting its prey. In fact, it’s even developed similar characteristics to other orders (like ants and mites) for its own survival.\n\nBut how, exactly, have these creatures developed and maintained these protective characteristics? A new study published in Cell found the answer to this question. Here’s the secret sauce fueling the rove beetle’s longevity.\n\nWhat Fuels the Rove Beetles’ Longevity?\n\nRove beetles have been around for over 100 million years. ©Henri Koskinen/Shutterstock.com\n\nScientists have officially discovered and analyzed the two cell types in the rove beetle’s tergal gland that produce protective repellants. Essentially, one cell creates a toxic chemical (like benzoquinone), while the other creates an activating liquid. Together, the two cells repel predators and protect the beetle from harm. This process is similar to how plants produce poisons as a protective mechanism.\n\n“The rove beetle tergal gland is this incredible, reprogrammable device for making new chemistries and evolving new interactions,” said Caltech biologist Joe Parker, a corresponding author of the study, in this article by Caltech. “It enabled these beetles to achieve extreme forms of ecological specialization. Without the gland, there would have been no getting into the weird and wonderful niches that these beetles have found themselves.”\n\nFor over 100 million years, the rove beetles’ gland chemistry has continued to adapt. In addition to repelling predators, these glands allow them to dominate new environments. For example, some of the species can mimic prey like mites and ants by producing similar chemicals. In many cases, rove beetles can infiltrate entire ant colonies via myrmecophily. Basically, these beetles are massive manipulators, convincing ants they are one of their own — all thanks to their tergal glands.\n\nWhat’s more? Once the beetles live alongside aggressive ant colonies, during evolution, many of them lose their glands and simply adapt to their co-inhabitants.\n\n“Apparently, once you have lived inside an army ant colony of millions of aggressive ants for long enough, you no longer need the gland,” explained postdoctoral scholar Sheila Kitchen, lead study author and an assistant professor at Texas A&M University, in the same Caltech article.\n\nThe rove beetle’s tergal gland is located at the tip of its abdomen. It’s also a prime example of macroevolution. The gland’s successful evolution is the driving force behind the insect’s diversification into over 66,000 species.\n\nHow Scientists Studied Rove Beetles’ Longevity\n\nThere are over 66,000 species of rove beetles — in large part thanks to their tergal glands. ©Sendo Serra/Shutterstock.com\n\nTo draw such remarkable conclusions, the scientists analyzed genomes across various beetle species. Through this research, they discovered that the rove beetle has maintained its tergal gland for over 100 million years. In fact, they traced the gland back to its development during the Early Cretaceous period.\n\nThe scientists also studied the evolution of two specific cell types in the tergal gland and their complex chemical defense system. They achieved this by “regramming” the cell types or tweaking the genes/gene functions. This helped them better understand the rove beetle’s chemical abilities and ecological specialization.\n\nThis research has allowed the study authors to identify similarities in the gland’s genetic architecture across various rove beetle species. Some of these ancient genes have repurposed themselves by adopting new functions to help the beetle survive and adapt to its environment. Additionally, some rove beetle species have even developed evolutionarily new genes to achieve these new protective functions. Coupled with their repurposed and entirely new genes/functions, it’s no wonder the rove beetle is so resilient.\n\nHow Are Rove Beetles Similar to Plants?\n\nMany types of plants, like poison ivy, produce toxic chemicals to protect themselves from predators. ©meunierd/Shutterstock.com\n\nAs mentioned earlier, similar to some plants, rove beetles can produce toxic chemicals that repel predators. According to the study published in Cell, scientists identified “molecular evolutionary steps leading to benzoquinone production by one cell type via a mechanism convergent with plant toxin release systems, and synthesis by the second cell type of a solvent that weaponizes the total secretion.” Together, the two cells have kept the rove beetle family alive and thriving for over 100 million years.\n\nMuch like plants, the rove beetle has developed these protective cellular functions—back by toxic chemicals—without harming or poisoning themselves. This allows them to defend themselves against predators without enduring negative consequences from their own toxins.\n\nThese plant-like abilities have helped the rove beetle to explode into over 66,000 species. Their powerful self-protective chemicals allow them to escape predators and manipulative prey. Not only is this a testament to their previous evolution but also to their continued evolvability."

It’s a snapshot of how your work continues to push the mission forward, every single day. Here’s some happenings from around the agency:\n\nAt Armstrong, engineers are conducting calibration flights for a new shock-sensing probe that will support future flight tests of the X-59 quiet supersonic demonstrator. Mounted on a research F-15D that will follow the X-59 closely in flight, the probe will gather data on the shock waves the X-59 generates, providing important data about its ability to fly faster than sound, but produce only a quiet thump.\n\nTeams began acceptance hot fire testing the first of three 12-kW Solar Electric Propulsion thrusters. Each thruster will operate for about 50 hours inside a NASA Glenn vacuum facility to ensure the hardware meets workmanship standards and performance requirements. The Advanced Electric Propulsion System thrusters will be critical to future exploration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\n\nAt NASA Kennedy, the team moved the interim cryogenic propulsion stage, which will propel Orion and the Artemis II crew around the Moon, to the Vehicle Assembly Building. Next, technicians will place the upper stage on top of the SLS (Space Launch System) core stage, paving the way for upcoming integrated testing.\n\nWe’re preparing to welcome NASA astronaut Don Pettit home on Saturday, April 19, concluding a seven-month science mission aboard the International Space Station. Don is scheduled to land in Kazakhstan at 9:20 p.m. EDT (6:20 a.m. Kazakhstan time, Sunday, April 20). Don also celebrates his 70th birthday on Sunday, April 20. Happy early birthday, Don!\n\nNASA premiered “Planetary Defenders,” a new documentary that follows the dedicated team behind asteroid detection and planetary defense. The film debuted at an event at Headquarters with digital creators, interagency and international partners, and now is streaming on NASA+, YouTube, and X. In its first 24 hours, it saw 25,000 views on YouTube – 75% above average – and reached 4 million impressions on X.\n\nEarlier this month, we launched the Efficiencies Ideas Submission form to hear directly from you – our workforce – on how we can make NASA more efficient at every level. To date, we have received more than 1,500 submissions from across the agency, offering a wide range of thoughtful, mission-focused ideas. Your input touched on everything from streamlining hiring and improving procurement, to modernizing our technology and improving knowledge and data management. On the mission front, suggestions included ideas on optimizing science missions and streamlining operations as well as accelerating technology development and focusing aeronautics research. These ideas reflect not only your deep expertise, but also your unwavering dedication to making NASA better. We’ll continue reviewing your suggestions and will share a summary of our findings and planned actions in the coming months.\n\nIn parallel, we’re also continuing to prepare our next response to the President’s Workforce Optimization Initiative for submission Monday. The response includes proposed organizational options to streamline and align our structure. The proposals are intended to provide a foundation for consideration by our future, confirmed administrator.\n\nAll of this work – whether it’s reviewing your ideas or streamlining our structure – points to the same goal: ensuring NASA remains ready and able to deliver on our mission, now and in the years ahead. Your insights, your commitment, and your continued focus on excellence are what make that possible.\n\nEmbrace the Challenge,\n\nJanet"

            "description": "Planaria can’t replace a missing head until after the tail develops sufficiently.",
            "content": "For those of us whose memory of high school biology hasn't faded entirely, planarians will probably sound very familiar. They're generally used as an example of one of the extreme ends of regenerative capacity. While some animals like mammals have a limited ability to regenerate lost tissues, planarians can be cut roughly in half and regenerate either an entire head or entire tail, depending on which part of the body you choose to keep track of.\n\nIn doing so, they have to re-establish something that is typically only needed early in an animal's development: a signaling system that helps tell cells where the animal's head and tail are. Now, a US-based team asked a question that I'd never have thought of: What happens if you cut the animal in half early in development, while the developmental head-to-tail signaling system is still active? The answer turned out to be surprisingly complex.\n\nHeads or tails?\n\nPlanarians are small flatworms that would probably be living quiet lives somewhere if biologists hadn't discovered their ability to regenerate lots of adult tissues when damaged. The process has been well-studied by this point and involves the formation of a cluster of stem cells, called a blastema, at the site of damage. From there, many of the signals that control the formation of specialized tissues in the embryo get re-activated, directing the stem cells down the developmental pathways needed to reproduce any lost organs.\n\nCritical to this process is a signaling system that helps inform the animal of where its head is. Signaling molecules called wnts help developing embryos form what's called the anterior-posterior axis by telling the animal where its posterior resides. If it's needed, wnt signaling may also be reactivated during regeneration after the loss of major portions of the animal, inducing the blastema to form new tail structures. That reactivation takes place in the animal's muscle, which appears to be a key tissue in the process of sensing the damage and inducing regeneration.\n\nThe question being asked here is what happens if the damage that induces regeneration happens while the animal is still developing at a time when wnt signaling is normally patterning the animal's organs. To find out, the researchers started taking planarian embryos (from the species named Schmidtea polychroa) and slicing them in half."

            "description": "The fast-moving gas cloud could help explain the so-called missing satellite problem, if the object is what scientists think it is.",
            "content": "Astronomers may have just stumbled across a ghost galaxy hiding in plain sight — a small, starless, fast-moving cloud of gas that checks all the boxes for what’s known as a “dark galaxy.” And if the discovery holds up, it could help plug one of cosmology’s most puzzling holes: the mysterious “missing satellite” problem.\n\nThe team’s research, published today in Science Advances, describes AC G185.0–11.5, a compact hydrogen cloud tucked inside a larger high-velocity cloud (HVC) known as AC-I. The cloud was spotted by an international research team using China’s huge FAST radio telescope. While HVCs are known to zoom around at speeds beyond that of our Milky Way’s rotation, most are relatively featureless gas blobs. But the recently spotted gas cloud is different: it spins.\n\nFAST’s ultra-sensitive observations revealed a clear rotational pattern in the cloud, whose gas is arranged in a disk shape — the kind of structure you’d expect from a dwarf galaxy. But something’s amiss: there’s no sign of stars in the cloud, and no molecular gas (the usual star-forming stuff) to be found. AC G185.0–11.5 is apparently constituted of just hydrogen gas, swirling in space, with nothing within it lighting it up. Ergo, a dark galaxy.\n\nUsing galactic motion equations and a cosmic yardstick called the Tully-Fisher relation, the team estimated the cloud’s distance from Earth: about 278,000 light-years. That puts the cloud comfortably within the Local Group, our galactic neighborhood. As for mass, the cloud sits between 30 million and nearly 500 million Solar masses—not huge, but enough to be considered a galaxy in its own right.\n\nBut what gives AC G185.0–11.5 its nifty label of “dark galaxy” is its dark matter content. The researchers believe the cloud is held together by a massive dark matter halo, making it an ideal dark galaxy candidate — a theoretical type of galaxy made mostly of dark matter, with little or no visible stars.\n\nThis isn’t the first time scientists have suspected that some high-velocity clouds might actually be hidden galaxies, but most other candidates have lacked clear rotation or have been too difficult to distinguish from the Milky Way’s halo. AC G185.0–11.5 looks like the real deal — potentially the best evidence yet for a galaxy that’s all meat and no potatoes. You know, if potatoes were stars.\n\nIf the candidate dark galaxy is confirmed as such, it could rewrite how we think about galaxy formation. The cloud offers a tantalizing hint about where all the “missing” small galaxies might be hiding — not missing, just sitting lightless in plain sight."

            "content": "A pseudo-color image of the ultra-diffuse galaxy FCC 224, as captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nAstronomers have stumbled upon yet another ghostly galaxy that appears to be devoid of dark matter.\n\nDark matter, the invisible substance astronomers believe dominates the universe , provides the gravitational scaffolding for galaxies to assemble and grow. Discovering a galaxy without dark matter is indeed perplexing, like finding a shadow without a source.\n\nYet, over the past decade, several such sightings have been reported — all of them so-called \"ultradiffuse galaxies,\" which are about the size of our own Milky Way but remarkably sparse in stars.\n\nThe latest member of this puzzling collection, known as FCC 224, resides on the fringes of the Fornax Cluster, a collection of galaxies that lies roughly 65 million light-years from Earth.\n\nRelated: What is dark matter?\n\nFirst spotted in 2024 , FCC 224 is a dwarf galaxy that boasts a dozen luminous, tightly bound clusters of stars — an unusually rich population for its size, typically seen in larger, dark-matter rich galaxies — yet appears to lack the mysterious substance. It also occupies a distinctly different cosmic neighborhood than other galaxies that are deficient in dark matter, suggesting such objects might not be isolated flukes but rather represent a more common, previously unrecognized class of dwarf galaxies, according to two complementary papers published last month.\n\n\"No existing galaxy formation model within our standard cosmological paradigm can currently explain how this galaxy came to be,\" Maria Buzzo, a doctoral candidate in astrophysics at the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia who led one of the new studies , said in a statement .\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nUsing data from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, Buzzo and her team tracked the movement of a dozen star clusters within FCC 224. These measurements revealed a slow speed among the clusters, a key indicator that the galaxy lacks the strong gravitational pull expected from dark matter, the new study reports. No known scenario can fully explain FCC 224's properties, the researchers say.\n\nAnother team, led by astronomer Yimeng Tang at the University of California, Santa Cruz, compared FCC 224's properties to other galaxies that seemingly lack dark matter, focusing on two ghostly objects within the NGC 1052 group about 65 million light-years away in the constellation Cetus.\n\nTang and his colleagues propose that FCC 224, like those NGC 1052 dwarf galaxies, formed from a high-velocity collision of gas-rich galaxies. In such an event, the gas separates from the dark matter, and subsequent star formation in the expelled gas forms one or more dark-matter-free galaxies.\n\nPrevious research found that the two galaxies in the NGC 1052 group, DF2 and DF4, belong to a trail of seven to 11 dark-matter-deficient galaxies that formed in the same ancient collision. FCC 224 likely has a twin galaxy, too, Tang and his team suggest in their study .\n\nOne candidate is the nearby galaxy FCC 240, which appears to have the same size, shape and orientation as FCC 224. If forthcoming observations confirm the shared properties, it would provide crucial evidence supporting the collision scenario for the formation of FCC 224, the researchers say.\n\nAlternatively, FCC 224 could be the result of a chaotic, high-energy environment where intense star formation from overmassive star clusters expelled dark matter from the galaxy, the team suggests.\n\n\"FCC 224 serves as a crucial data point in our effort to identify and study other dark-matter-deficient galaxies,\" Buzzo said in the statement. \"By expanding the sample size, we can refine our understanding of these rare galaxies and of the role of dark matter in dwarf galaxy formation.\""

            "content": "Paleontologists have identified a gigantic apex predator that once roamed Central Asia and towered over early tyrannosaurs—offering a glimpse into a forgotten age of prehistoric giants.\n\nThe newly described species, Ulughbegsaurus uzbekistanensis, was discovered in the Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan and dates back to approximately 90 million years ago, during the early Late Cretaceous period.\n\nAccording to a 2021 study published in Royal Society Open Science, Ulughbegsaurus was part of the Carcharodontosauria family—a group of massive predatory theropods that predated and once dominated ecosystems before the rise of tyrannosaurids.\n\nThe fossil, identified from a large upper jawbone, reveals a creature estimated to be 7.5 to 8 meters long (about 26 feet) and weighing over 1,000 kilograms—placing it well above its contemporary tyrannosauroids in size and power.\n\nA Colossal Predator Among Giants\n\nThe fossil record of the region had long puzzled paleontologists. Although numerous species of smaller carnivorous dinosaurs, including tyrannosauroids, had been unearthed, the absence of a top predator had left a gap in the ecological puzzle—until now.\n\n“The apex predator was missing from the species, and now here it is,” said Dr. Darla Zelenitsky, one of the study’s lead authors. “It’s surprising it took this long to identify such a large predator.”\n\nUlughbegsaurus filled that apex role with ease. It possessed powerful jaws and slashing teeth adapted for tearing flesh rather than crushing bone—a stark contrast to the later, more robust T. rex.\n\nAccording to Zelenitsky, the difference in size between Ulughbegsaurus and early tyrannosaurs was like “a grizzly bear standing beside a coyote.” She noted that “Ulughbegsaurus was the dominant apex predator of its time.”\n\nLeft maxilla of Ulughbegsaurus uzbekistanensis. Image credit: Kohei et al., doi: 10.1098/rsos.210923.\n\nTyrannosaurs Held Down by Bigger Rivals\n\nThe ecosystem of the Late Cretaceous wasn’t always ruled by tyrannosaurs. In fact, early tyrannosauroids like Timurlengia, which lived alongside Ulughbegsaurus, were much smaller—measuring just 3 to 4 meters (10 to 13 feet) in length and weighing roughly 170 kilograms. These early forms were likely mesopredators, feeding on smaller prey and avoiding direct conflict with much larger competitors.\n\nAs Zelenitsky explained, “They likely kept the tyrannosaurus down,” referring to how dominant apex predators like Ulughbegsaurus may have prevented tyrannosaurs from growing into their later, monstrous proportions. It wasn’t until after the extinction of these carcharodontosaurians that tyrannosaurids had the ecological space to evolve into giants like Tyrannosaurus rex.\n\nA Disappearance That Reshaped Evolution\n\nUlughbegsaurus’s reign came to an end near the end of the Turonian age, around 89 million years ago. What exactly led to its extinction remains uncertain, but environmental upheavals or shifts in prey availability may have played a role.\n\n“The extinction of Ulughbegasaurus may have been driven by changes in prey or environmental conditions,” Zelenitsky said.\n\nIts disappearance marked a turning point in dinosaur evolution. With these apex predators gone, the ecological vacuum allowed tyrannosaurs to begin their ascent—eventually dominating Late Cretaceous food chains across North America and Asia."

            "content": "There are so many factors that can influence how we perceive others, which in turn can determine the people we choose as platonic friends or romantic mates. We certainly make snap judgments based on physical appearance, but scent can have a powerful influence, too. According to a new paper published in the journal Scientific Reports, two heterosexual women meeting for the first time rely partly on scent to judge whether they want to be friends with each other, deciding within minutes—practically at first whiff—whether there is friendship potential.\n\nSocial olfactory research largely stems from evolutionary psychology, specifically the work of Swiss biologist Claus Wedekind in 1995. Subtle chemical signals from pheromones are known to play a role in attraction in many species. Scientists had already found evidence in fish and mice that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, which are critical for immune system function (and useful in determining tissue compatibility for transplants, for instance)—showed a marked preference for sexual partners with different MHC genes, perhaps as a way of keeping the gene pool well-mixed and protecting against inbreeding.\n\nWedekind introduced the so-called \"sweaty T-shirt\" method to study the possible role of MHC in mate preferences in humans. Male participants wore the same T-shirt for two days, which were then placed in identical boxes. Women participants then smelled each shirt and indicated which ones they found most sexually attractive. Wedekind found that the women overwhelmingly preferred the T-shirt smells of men who had the most dissimilar MHCs to their own. The only caveat: The preference was reversed in women who were taking oral birth control.\n\nThere have been many other smelly T-shirt studies since Wedekind published his findings, even inspiring the trend of \"pheromone parties\" for amorously inclined singles. The psychologists who authored this latest paper were more interested in studying the role of olfactory cues in platonic friendships. Smelly T-shirt studies often try to isolate a person's \"natural\" odor, devoid of scents from toiletries, pets, and other environmental factors. The Cornell team focused on so-called \"diplomatic\" odor, which incorporates all those other factors.\n\nWhy can’t we be friends?\n\n“It’s not just perfume,” said co-author Jessica Gaby of Middle Tennessee State University. “It’s your dietary choices. Are you a cat person or dog person? What laundry detergent do you use? All these judgments come together into what we call ‘diplomatic odor.’ You live in this odor space–does it match with the odor spaces of the people you interact with?”"

            "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen a new comet appears in the sky, there is often excitement. But things don’t always end well for the ancient celestial objects, made of ice, frozen gases and rock, as they near the sun — and an untimely demise appears to hold true for Comet C/2025 F2 (SWAN).\n\nAll signs suggest that the celestial object, which resembled a fuzzy green patch, has disintegrated in the last couple days, said Qicheng Zang, a postdoctoral fellow studying small body astronomy at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona.\n\nThe latest ground-based observations from telescopes do seem to imply the comet has fallen apart, said Dr. Karl Battams, a computational scientist within the Solar and Heliospheric Physics Branch at the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC.\n\nAdditional observations will help confirm whether disintegration is the true cause of the comet’s apparent outburst and dimming.\n\n“There’s a remnant dust cloud that should continue to be telescopically visible for a few more weeks, but it’s spreading out and fading,” Zang said.\n\nSky-gazers in the Northern Hemisphere can see the comet’s remnant in the early morning.\n\nPrior to the disintegration, part of the hype around the comet was the fact that it was only recently discovered, and the comet’s closest pass of the sun on May 1 would present a once-in-a-lifetime viewing opportunity, likely not reappearing for hundreds of thousands of years — or leaving the solar system all together.\n\nNow, sky-gazers can essentially see the comet remnant’s final passage.\n\nThe object takes its name from the Solar Wind ANisotropies, or SWAN, instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO, spacecraft, a joint project of the European Space Agency and NASA. Amateur astronomers Vladimir Bezugly from Ukraine, Michael Mattiazzo in Australia and US-based Rob Matson each independently spotted and reported the object, known as Comet SWAN or SWAN25F, while looking through images taken by the SWAN instrument at the end of March. The Minor Planet Center officially designated it as C/2025 F2 (SWAN) on April 8.\n\nThe three astronomers “noticed a faint smudge, indicative of a comet, that seemed to move across the sky over a period of a few days.”\n\n“Since no comet was known to be in that part of the sky at that time, they correctly assumed it to be a new discovery,” Battams said.\n\nBattams is also principal investigator for the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph instrument suite, a set of three telescopes on the SOHO spacecraft that takes images of the sun’s atmosphere.\n\nBattams recommends looking “low to the northeast horizon an hour or two before dawn” to see the remnant.\n\nA NASA animation depicts how comets orbit the sun and how the sun's heat causes a \"tail\" to form behind a comet. NASA Jet Propulsion Lab\n\n“It will only be visible from the northern hemisphere until very early May, and then will gradually rise in the southern hemisphere skies,” Battams said in an email.\n\nJust remember to look low toward the horizon, rather than high in the sky, to see it.\n\nThe fragmenting of a comet\n\nSome reports had shown that the comet’s initial brightness faded slightly within the last few days, Battams said.\n\nNow, astronomers recognize that this slight dimming was likely a sign of the comet’s fate.\n\n“It’s now likely the surge in brightness after the comet was discovered was actually the comet beginning to disintegrate,” Zang said in an email. “When they initially break apart, it exposes all the ice in its interior to the Sun, causing them to turn to gas (which we saw as the green glow that made the comet bright) all at once.”\n\nAs the ice runs out, gas gradually stops being released, and the comet dims, he said.\n\n“It looks like we’re now pretty much at the point where the ice/gas is just about all gone, so all that’s left is the dust.”\n\nAstronomers suspect the comet came from the Oort Cloud, a reservoir of icy bodies thought to exist at the edge of our solar system far from the warm reach of the sun.\n\n“Every now and then, an Oort Cloud comet will get gravitationally ‘nudged’ out of this reservoir and will begin to fall in towards the Sun,” Battams said in an email. “We think this comet has been heading inwards for about 35,000 years, although it’s difficult to be too precise about those numbers.”\n\nEarthSky has reported that recent observations suggest the comet completes one orbit around the sun every 2.1 million years.\n\nAs comets approach the sun, our star’s heat causes them to release gas and dust, which provide their signature tails.\n\nBigger comets, which are heavier, don’t tend to disintegrate as they near the sun. But it’s more common for smaller comets because as they release their gases, the celestial objects spin rapidly until they fly apart, Zang said.\n\n“The extreme solar radiation was more than this comet could handle,” Battams said. “Scientists are still trying to work out the specifics of what drives fragmentation like this. It is almost certainly a combination of factors or processes, but fundamentally it’s all due to a comet with a very volatile surface/composition getting too close to the Sun. It is definitely not uncommon, and I’m honestly not at all surprised this one in particular appears to be doing so.”\n\nLast October, the “Halloween comet” disintegrated during its closest approach of the sun.\n\nThe object, also known as Comet C/2024 S1 (ATLAS), was discovered on September 27 and quickly earned its nickname following speculation that it might be visible in the night sky near the end of October. But as the comet neared the sun, it broke apart into chunks until it finally evaporated, according to NASA.\n\nC/2024 S1 was a sungrazer, a comet that passes within a distance of about 850,000 miles (1,367,942 kilometers) from the sun. Sungrazers often vaporize due to the intense, hot solar atmosphere.\n\nComet C/2025 F2 (SWAN) was expected to pass within 31 million miles (50 million kilometers) of the sun in May.\n\nHow to spot the fragment\n\nThe remnant will appear within the constellation Andromeda in the northeastern sky a couple of hours or so before sunrise, Zang said. Then, the dust cloud will reappear in the night sky toward the end of April. A new moon on the evening of April 27 will make the comet easier to see.\n\nThe remnant will be easier for those in the Southern Hemisphere to see in May, according to The Planetary Society.\n\nThe celestial object will appear near the constellation Taurus above the western horizon after sunset and appear higher in the sky each night in May.\n\nDiscovering a new comet\n\nThe SWAN instrument wasn’t designed to pick out comets in the night sky, but it has contributed to the discovery of 16 comets to date, Zang said.\n\n“It’s a unique instrument designed to map out hydrogen in our solar system by looking at a certain type of light that gets scattered by neutral hydrogen atoms,” Battams said in an email. “But comets happen to be a very rich source of hydrogen — primarily by water of water-ice being vaporized by the Sun — and so they often glow quite brightly in the SWAN images.”\n\nAnother observation of the comet was made on April 11 by the Virtual Telescope Project. Gianluca Masi/Virtual Telescope Project.\n\nZang first observed the comet on the morning of April 2 and has seen it twice since then. He took images of the part of the sky where the comet was said to be, based on coordinates shared by those who found it using the SWAN data, and spotted the celestial object.\n\nBattams said that Zang was the first to observe it from the ground after the amateur astronomers made the SWAN discovery, and his observations were crucial for allowing other astronomers to point their telescopes at the correct location.\n\nAstronomer Gianluca Masi also observed the comet twice using a telescope in Manciano, Italy. Masi runs The Virtual Telescope Project, which offers views from remotely controlled robotic telescopes online.\n\nCNN’s Taylor Nicoli contributed to this report."

            "content": "NASA’s Perseverance rover has made a mysterious discovery during its exploration of Jezero Crater: a dark-colored stone with unusual features that “may have originated from elsewhere.”\n\nThe unexpected discovery, which the Perseverance team has dubbed “Skull Hill,” was made last week while the intrepid rover continued its descent down the lower part of Witch Hazel Hill along the crater’s rim.\n\nAt one point, the rover stopped at the boundary between a pair of distinct rock outcrops of contrasting coloration that were first revealed in orbital imagery of the crater. The intriguing location, which the Perseverance team had nicknamed “Port Anson,” appears to be a geological “contact” area featuring several intriguing angular rocks, some of which are believed to have originated someplace other than their current resting place.\n\nSuch “float” rocks, as scientists call these out-of-place stones, are not uncommon on the Red Planet. However, even in an area rich with such features, Skull Hill stands out as a curious sample of stone that has left NASA’s scientific team with many questions.\n\nA Closer Look at “Skull Hill”\n\nA dark-toned rock formation possessing a rugged, angular surface and several unusual pit-like markings, Skull Hill was discovered on April 11 by the rover’s Mastcam-Z instrument. The curious looking stone contrasts sharply against the lighter terrain surrounding it, primarily due to its chalky grey color and unusual pits, which the Perseverance team believes are likely the result of wind erosion over long periods.\n\nAnother reason for the rock’s strange, pitted appearance could involve the presence of clasts that were once embedded in it, which weathered away over time. Although Skull Hill is certainly an outlier among the local surrounding Martian rock samples, similar dark-colored float rocks have been discovered in the Port Anson area in the past.\n\nOngoing investigation into these unusual stones could help to determine not only their origins, but also the transport mechanisms behind their movement from their original location on the Red Planet’s surface.\n\nHowever, adding to the mystery is another intriguing possibility the Perseverance team considered: that Skull Hill might not originate from anywhere on Mars at all.\n\nMeteorite or Magmatic Mystery?\n\nBased on the stone’s dark coloration and unusual shape, one possibility that was initially considered had been that Skull Hill might be a fragment from a meteorite that made its way to the Martian surface.\n\nAlthough the stone’s appearance does superficially resemble a meteorite, chemical analysis of the sample made possible by Perseverance’s SuperCam instrument indicates a composition that likely rules out a meteorite origin.\n\nBut if not a meteorite, then what could account for Skull Hill’s unusual appearance?\n\nThe best explanation so far seems to be that the mysterious stone is an igneous rock, which likely formed as molten lava or magma cooled long ago in the Red Planet’s history. Such volcanic stones are common both on Mars, and on Earth, and contain an abundance of elements like iron and magnesium which would contribute to their dark color.\n\nOther minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite—all of which are frequently found in igneous rocks—might also be present in Skull Hill.\n\nFurther investigations by Perseverance will likely help to shed additional light on the mystery.\n\n“Luckily for us, the rover has instruments that can measure the chemical composition of rocks on Mars,” said Margaret Deahn, Ph.D., a student at Purdue University who wrote about the recent discovery in a blog post at NASA’s website.\n\n“Understanding the composition of these darker-toned floats will help the team to interpret the origin of this unique rock,” Deahn added. By analyzing the composition of dark-toned float rocks like Skull Hill, the team hopes to trace their geologic story—whether shaped by volcanic activity, impact events, or something entirely unexpected.\n\nAdditional information about “Skull Hill” and Perseverance’s latest investigations can be found on NASA’s official blogs webpage.\n\nMicah Hanks is the Editor-in-Chief and Co-Founder of The Debrief.

The slower one was “eaten” by the faster one, hence the cannibalistic aspect.\n\nCT Insider adds that when these CMEs hit Earth’s magnetic field, they exploded into those colorful lights we all know and love as aurorae. Aurorae typically show up at higher magnitudes — like Alaska – making this recent display particularly exciting for people who got to see them in places like New Zealand.\n\nHeck, it was even a treat for people who glimpse aurorae often, as they were particularly brilliant and vibrant.\n\n“I was amazed and almost overwhelmed,” wrote aurora photographer, Austin McDonald, via email to Space.com. “Living in Finland, I see auroras pretty often…But last night was something special.\n\n“It came on so fast, and it wasn’t just overhead, it was to the south, north, east, west. … It felt like I was standing inside a 360-degree aurora sphere. It just made me feel incredibly small.”\n\nThe New York Post states that these aurorae were spotted over the United Kingdom and Ireland, among other areas."

            "content": "In a demonstration of nature’s raw power, a new island has emerged from the Red Sea. This natural phenomenon, triggered by volcanic activity, has left scientists and onlookers alike in awe. The formation of this island provides a rare glimpse into the dynamic forces that shape our planet, particularly in the volatile regions where tectonic plates meet.\n\nA Volcanic Eruption That Created a New World\n\nThe island’s formation began with an eruption of volcanic activity in the Red Sea, specifically in the Zubair archipelago, near Yemen. This eruption is part of a much larger and ongoing geological event taking place in the region, where the African and Arabian tectonic plates are slowly pulling apart. As these plates separate, new oceanic crust is regularly created, and this time, it resulted in the creation of a new landmass.\n\nThe Birth of an Island\n\nThe eruption that led to this island’s formation was first observed by fishermen in the area on December 19, 2023. They witnessed lava shooting 30 meters into the air, an extraordinary sight that soon caught the attention of satellite monitoring systems.\n\nNASA’s Earth Observing One satellite captured images of the event, and elevated sulfur dioxide levels in the air were recorded by NASA’s Aura satellite. By December 23, just four days later, the eruption had created a solidified mass of lava that broke through the ocean’s surface.\n\nThe new island, roughly 500 meters wide, began to take shape as the lava continued its cooling and solidifying process. The island’s future remains uncertain. Will it grow larger, or will it succumb to the harsh waves of the Red Sea?\n\nThe Red Sea Rift: A Natural Wonder\n\nThe phenomenon of new island formation in the Red Sea is not an isolated incident. The region sits on what is known as the Red Sea Rift, where the tectonic plates of Africa and Arabia are slowly moving apart.\n\nThis rift is a hotspot for geological activity, regularly generating new crust and occasionally resulting in the birth of new islands. The formation of this island serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing changes beneath the Earth’s surface.\n\nThe Red Sea: A Hotspot for Geological Activity\n\nAt this point, it is still unclear whether this new island will remain or disappear. While its creation is a spectacle of nature’s strength, it is not guaranteed to endure. The surrounding waters of the Red Sea are notorious for their wave action, which may eventually erode the island. Alternatively, continued volcanic activity could allow it to grow, potentially becoming a permanent feature of the Zubair archipelago.\n\nAs of now, the island is still in its infancy, but its presence raises interesting questions about the future of the Red Sea region. Could more islands form as the tectonic plates continue to shift? Will the region’s volcanic activity intensify in the coming years? These are just a few of the questions scientists will undoubtedly be investigating as they monitor the ongoing eruption and the island’s development."

            "description": "The Aral Sea may have vanished from maps, but scientists say the ground beneath it is still moving—proof that human activity can literally shift Earth’s interior.",
            "content": "A devastating environmental collapse that began in the 1960s is still leaving deep marks beneath the surface of the Earth. According to a new study published in Nature Geoscience, the Aral Sea—once the world’s fourth-largest lake—was so drastically altered by human intervention that the planet’s mantle is still shifting today, nearly 80 years later.\n\nNicknamed the “quiet Chernobyl” for its long-term ecological damage, the Aral Sea disaster began when the Soviet Union diverted rivers for agriculture, leading to a catastrophic loss of water. Now, scientists say the weight loss from the dried-out lake triggered a slow-motion rebound in Earth’s crust and mantle, one that continues—and will do so for decades to come.\n\nThe Collapse That Reached Beneath the Crust\n\nThe Aral Sea’s shrinkage was once seen only as an environmental tragedy. But today, it is also understood as a rare geophysical case study. Over 80 years, it lost more than 1.1 billion tons of water, the equivalent mass of 150 Great Pyramids of Giza. That immense weight loss, while seemingly local, had deep geological consequences.\n\nAs Earth’s surface adjusts to the sudden removal of that mass, the crust is slowly springing back upward. Geologist Simon Lamb, who did not participate in the study, explains that this rebound was initially expected. “Because the weight of the water in the lake would have depressed the underlying rock,” he wrote, “it was anticipated that this rock would rebound by some small fraction of the original water depth while the weight was being removed.”\n\nBut what surprised researchers is just how far that rebound extends—and how long it’s lasting. The process is no longer just a surface adjustment. It reveals how the mantle—the semi-fluid rock beneath the crust—is responding to changes on the Earth’s surface caused entirely by human actions.\n\nSatellite Data Proves the Earth Is Still Rising\n\nUsing satellite radar technology (InSAR) between 2016 and 2020, researchers mapped small but measurable changes in the Earth’s surface. They found a persistent bulge spreading outward in a 310-mile radius from the center of the former Aral Sea. This bulge is not just a leftover wrinkle in the crust—it’s part of an ongoing, dynamic reaction beneath the Earth’s surface.\n\nThe land is rising at a rate of 0.3 inches (7 mm) per year, with a total uplift of 1.6 inches (40 mm) already observed during the study period. According to the scientists, this bulge is being driven by mantle rocks flowing slowly to replace material that was previously displaced by the weight of the Aral Sea.\n\n“The Aral Sea, although never particularly deep, was wide enough in its heyday for its weight to be felt in the Earth at tens to hundreds of kilometres depth,” wrote Lamb. He added: “This is because the outermost strong layer of cold rock cannot carry the weight of such a wide body of water without sinking slightly into the underlying hotter and weaker rocks.”\n\nFrom Inland Sea to Deep-Time Warning\n\nThe dried basin of the Aral Sea is now a desert wasteland, dotted with rusted shipwrecks and toxic dust. But the scars go far deeper than the eye can see. What once looked like a regional ecological disaster is now recognized as a global geological event—one with implications for how human actions impact deep Earth systems.\n\nThe study’s authors argue that this case sets a precedent for other large-scale changes, like glacial melt and water reservoir depletion, which may also trigger mantle adjustments in the decades to come. The Aral Sea, once a sprawling lake that seemed confined to Central Asia, has become a planetary-level cautionary tale.\n\nThis example adds urgency to our understanding of how surface-level environmental damage—particularly on a massive scale—can ripple deep into the Earth, affecting even the internal mechanics of the planet."

            "content": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA’s Lucy spacecraft will swoop past a small asteroid this weekend as it makes its way to an even bigger prize: the unexplored swarms of asteroids out near Jupiter.\n\nIt will be the second asteroid encounter for Lucy, launched in 2021 on a quest that will take it to 11 space rocks. The close approaches should help scientists better understand our early solar system when planets were forming; asteroids are the ancient leftovers.\n\nThe upcoming flyby is a dress rehearsal for 2027 when Lucy reaches its first so-called Trojan asteroid near Jupiter.\n\nCranking up its three science instruments, the spacecraft on Sunday will observe the harmless asteroid known as Donaldjohanson. The encounter will take place 139 million miles (223 million kilometers) from Earth in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, so far away it will take 12 minutes for each bit of data to reach flight controllers in Colorado.\n\nThe paleontologist for whom the asteroid is named plans to be at spacecraft builder and operator Lockheed Martin’s Mission Control for all the action. He discovered the fossil Lucy in Ethiopia 50 years ago; the spacecraft is named after the famous human ancestor.\n\nNASA’s Lucy will venture as close as 596 miles (960 kilometers) to this asteroid, an estimated 2 ½ miles (4 kilometers) in length but much shorter in width. Scientists should have a better idea of its size and shape following the brief visit. The spacecraft will zoom by at more than 30,000 mph (48,000 kph).\n\nThe asteroid is among countless fragments believed to have resulted from a major collision 150 million years ago.\n\n“It’s not going to be a basic potato. We already know that,” said lead scientist Hal Levison of Southwest Research Institute.\n\nRather, Levison said the asteroid may resemble a bowling pin or even a snowman like Arrokoth, the Kuiper Belt object visited by NASA’s New Horizon spacecraft in 2019. The other possibility is that there are two elongated but separate asteroids far apart.\n\n“We don’t know what to expect. That’s what makes this so cool,” he said.\n\nThere will be no communications with Lucy during the flyby as the spacecraft turns its antenna away from Earth in order to track the asteroid. Levison expects to have most of the science data within a day.\n\nLucy’s next stop — “the main event,” as Levison calls it — will be the Trojan asteroids that share Jupiter’s orbit around the sun. Swarms of Trojans precede and follow the solar system’s largest planet as it circles the sun. Lucy will visit eight of them from 2027 through 2033, some of them in pairs of two.\n\nLucy’s first asteroid flyby was in 2023 when it swept past little Dinkinesh, also in the main asteroid belt. The spacecraft discovered a mini moon around it.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

            "content": "An illustration of a nova explosion erupting after a white dwarf siphons too much material from its larger stellar companion.\n\nGroundbreaking observations of a repeating explosion in space, the recurrent nova LMCN 1968-12a, reveal that it's the hottest burst of its kind ever recorded.\n\nLocated in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby satellite galaxy of the Milky Way , LMCN 1968-12a is the first recurrent nova outside our galaxy to have been studied in near-infrared light.\n\nBeyond its extreme temperatures, this nova is also notable for being an extremely violent eruption with unique chemical properties that differ significantly from those observed in our galaxy, the researchers explained in a paper published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .\n\nSeeing dead stars\n\nWhen a white dwarf, the leftover core of a collapsed star, is in a tight orbit around another star, it can pull material from that star, leading to some pretty dramatic astronomical events. One of these is called a nova, which means \"new\" in Latin.\n\nThis event results in a bright flash in the sky, as if a new star had appeared, and lasts a few weeks or months before fading. When the dust clears, the original stars remain (unlike in a supernova , which happens when a star is completely destroyed).\n\nIn the binary system, as the white dwarf steals gas from its younger companion, the accumulated material forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf. Matter swirls in the disk, and when it reaches the white dwarf's surface and piles up, the pressure and temperature rise so high that it ignites a rapid burning of hydrogen into heavier elements. This is known as a thermonuclear runaway reaction.\n\nRelated: Scientists find evidence of 'supernova graveyard' at the bottom of the sea — and possibly on the surface of the moon\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThis reaction produces a high-energy blast that expels a huge chunk of material from the white dwarf's surface — resulting in a nova. The nova is called \"recurrent\" when the white dwarf continues to pull more material from its companion, causing similar short-lived bursts of energy at regular intervals ranging from a few months to several years apart.\n\nNot many recurrent novas have been observed in our galaxy, and even fewer have been found outside the Milky Way. Studying novas helps astronomers understand the dynamics of binary systems and the influence of surrounding conditions on these eruptions.\n\nLMCN 1968-12a was the first recurrent nova to be found outside our galaxy. Discovered in 1968, the system consists of a white dwarf and a red subgiant star. It erupts every four years, and its eruptions have been observed regularly since 1990.\n\nThe most recent eruption occurred in August 2024. Following the initial observations, the Magellan Baade telescope and the Gemini South telescope — both in Chile — carried out follow-up observations of LMCN 1968-12a in near-infrared light nine days and 22 days after the outburst, respectively. The observations showed the light emitted by various elements that became highly energized during the eruption.\n\nA light spectrum analysis showing the unexpected chemicals detected in the nova explosion. (Image credit: International Gemini Observatory/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/T. Geballe/J. Pollard)\n\nReading the missing lines\n\nThe spectra from the Magellan telescope revealed a clear spike in ionized silicon that was 95 times brighter than the light emitted by the sun added up across all of its wavelengths. A similar dominance of silicon was seen in the spectra from Gemini, although the brightness was lower.\n\nThe brightness of silicon was unexpected, said study co-author Tom Geballe , an astronomer emeritus at NOIRLab, and the missing spikes were even more surprising.\n\n\"We would've expected to also see signatures of highly energized sulfur, phosphorus, calcium and aluminum,\" Geballe said in a statement .\n\nStudy co-author Sumner Starrfield , Regents professor of astrophysics at Arizona State University, added, \"This surprising absence, combined with the presence and great strength of the silicon signature, implied an unusually high gas temperature, which our modeling confirmed.\"\n\nAccording to the team's estimates, this is one of the hottest novas ever recorded, with the temperature of the expelled gas reaching 5.4 million degrees Fahrenheit (3 million degrees Celsius). The highly violent eruption, indicated by such extreme temperatures, suggests a connection to the conditions surrounding the nova.\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud has a lower metallicity than our galaxy, meaning it contains fewer elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. This results in a greater buildup of matter on the white dwarf's surface before ignition, leading to more violent nova explosions.\n\nBy contrast, in high-metallicity systems, heavy elements alter the process. Moreover, the ejected gas collides with the companion star's atmosphere, creating a shock that raises temperatures.\n\nStarrfield predicted that low-metallicity material would cause more-intense nova events, and the observations have come through. The study authors emphasized that using large telescopes like Gemini South to study different galaxies will enhance our understanding of these processes in various chemical environments.\n\nThis article was originally published on March 23, 2025."

            "description": "Discover how crocodiles survived two mass extinctions thanks to their flexible diets and habitats, according to research.",
            "content": "Most people imagine crocodiles as relics from the dinosaur era – unchanged, prehistoric predators lurking in murky waters. But their survival story is much more complex.\n\nNew research from the University of Central Oklahoma and the University of Utah shows that these animals aren’t just fossils with teeth. They’ve made it through two mass extinctions, thanks in part to one big advantage: adaptability.\n\nWhy crocodiles survived\n\nCrocodylians – today’s crocodiles, alligators, and gharials – are the last surviving members of a larger group called crocodylomorphs, which goes back 230 million years.\n\nThese ancient creatures included many now-extinct species that once lived in a range of environments.\n\nThe research is the first to closely examine the diets of these extinct animals to understand how some survived while others did not.\n\n“Lots of groups closely related to crocodylians were more diverse, more abundant, and exhibited different ecologies, yet they all disappeared except these few generalist crocodylians alive today,” said Keegan Melstrom, lead author and assistant professor at UCO.\n\n“Extinction and survivorship are two sides of the same coin. Through all mass extinctions, some groups manage to persist and diversify. What can we learn by studying the deeper evolutionary patterns imparted by these events?”\n\nToday, many scientists believe Earth is entering its sixth mass extinction, fueled by habitat loss, invasive species, and climate change. Studying past survivors, like crocodylians, may offer clues on how to protect today’s wildlife.\n\nCrocodylians vs. mammals\n\nFor years, mammals have been the go-to group for studying extinction and survival. Their flexible diets and ability to live in many habitats seemed to explain their resilience. But crocodylomorphs have long been overlooked in this conversation. This crocodylian study changes that.\n\n“There’s a danger of trying to draw conclusions from millions of years ago and directly apply it to conservation. We have to be cautious,” said co-author Randy Irmis.\n\n“If people study mammals and reptiles and find the same patterns with respect to extinction survival, then we might predict that species with a generalist diet may do better. That information helps us make predictions, but it’s unlikely we’ll ever be able to pick out which individual species will survive.”\n\nShrinking diversity of crocodile ancestors\n\nModern crocodylians are known for living in water and eating just about anything that crosses their path – fish, small mammals, even fellow crocodiles. But this lifestyle is only a narrow snapshot of their past.\n\nIn the Late Triassic Period, crocodylomorph ancestors lived mostly on land. They were small-to-medium-sized predators feeding on small animals. Other reptile groups were more dominant at the time, showing off a wide range of sizes and shapes.\n\nBut when the end-Triassic extinction struck, these dominant groups vanished. Only crocodylomorphs, especially those with flexible diets, pulled through.\n\n“After that, it goes bananas,” said Melstrom. “Aquatic hypercarnivores, terrestrial generalists, terrestrial hypercarnivores, terrestrial herbivores – crocodylomorphs evolved a massive number of ecological roles throughout the time of the dinosaurs.”\n\nFor a while, crocodylomorphs thrived in every corner of their ecosystems. But during the Late Cretaceous Period, their diversity began to shrink. By the time a meteor ended the age of dinosaurs 66 million years ago, only a few crocodylian lineages survived – most of them semi-aquatic generalists.\n\nThe evolution of crocodylians\n\nTo understand what these animals ate, the researchers studied the shape of fossilized teeth and skulls.\n\nSharp, pointed teeth suggested a meat-heavy diet, while flatter, grinding teeth pointed to a plant-based menu. Skull structure also offered clues about how the animals hunted and fed.\n\nThe crocodylian study was massive in scope. The researchers traveled to museum collections in seven countries across four continents.\n\nThe experts examined the skulls of 99 extinct crocodylomorph species and 20 living crocodylian species. To compare, they also analyzed dietary traits in 89 mammals and 47 lizards. This fossil record, stretching over 230 million years, revealed how crocodylians evolved into a variety of forms.\n\nSome were fast-moving land predators. Others grazed like herbivores. Many returned to the water. Today, that wide-ranging history is mostly hidden behind the toothy grin of a croc.\n\nWill crocodiles survive future changes?\n\nWhile modern crocodylians continue to thrive in rivers and swamps, many face serious threats. The gharial of the Himalayan foothills and the Cuban crocodile in the Zapata Swamp are critically endangered. Their survival may still hinge on one of their oldest traits – a flexible diet.\n\n“When we see living crocodiles and alligators, rather than thinking of ferocious beasts or expensive handbags, I hope people appreciate their amazing 200+ million years of evolution, and how they’ve survived so many tumultuous events in Earth history,” said Irmis.\n\n“Crocodylians are equipped to survive many future changes – if we’re willing to help preserve their habitats.”\n\nThe full crocodylian study was published in the journal Palaeontology.\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

On the morning of Friday, April 25, Venus, Saturn and the crescent moon will appear close together in the predawn sky, forming a triangular formation reminiscent of a smiley face. You can spot the celestial spectacle close to the eastern horizon just before sunrise, according to NASA. Both planets are bright and easily seen with the naked eye, but a good backyard telescope or stargazing binoculars can help you pick out details on the smirking crescent moon.\n\nMercury may also be visible below the twinkling trio for those with a clear view of the horizon, according to NASA. Unlike the larger planets, it will appear very low in the sky, so may not be visible everywhere.\n\nWhat is a triple conjunction?\n\nIn astronomy, a conjunction occurs when two or more celestial objects appear very close to each other in the night sky. When three objects are involved, it becomes a triple conjunction.\n\n\"Venus is higher above the eastern horizon with Saturn lower, and a thin, crescent Moon a bit lower and a little farther north,\" NASA Solar System Ambassador Brenda Culbertson told local Kansas TV station KSNT . \"The thin, crescent Moon looks like a smile.

            "content": "A prehistoric fish species that once swam alongside the dinosaurs might still be clinging to life in a muddy stretch of river in southern Kazakhstan. The Syr Darya sturgeon, unseen since the 1960s, is now at the center of a high-stakes mission led by researchers who believe the species may have escaped extinction.\n\nA Fossil from the Jurassic Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nThe Syr Darya sturgeon is the smallest of the 26 sturgeon species, reaching only 22 centimeters in length. With its long flattened snout, sensory barbels, and five rows of sharp bony plates along its body, the species shares key anatomical features with its larger cousins, such as the massive beluga sturgeon that can reach over 7 meters in length.\n\nFor 162 million years, sturgeons have survived monumental environmental upheavals. They lived through the breakup of continents, survived mass extinctions, and outlasted the meteorite impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. But despite this extraordinary evolutionary resilience, they now face a threat more formidable than any natural catastrophe: humans.\n\nEnvironmental Collapse on the Syr Darya\n\nBernie Kuhajda, an aquatic ecosystem biologist with the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute, traveled to the Syr Darya River in December, drawn by faint hopes and old memories. He is one of the few scientists who has ever seen the Syr Darya sturgeon—though only as preserved specimens stored in jars in museums across London, Moscow, and Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe region’s landscape, lined with dormant grasses and floodplain mud, is not picturesque. Yet it is precisely this forgotten stretch of river where Kuhajda believes the fish might still exist. “I’ve seen them, yes, but dead, in a jar,” he recalled when contacted by the wildlife nonprofit Re:Wild, which supports expeditions to locate “lost species” — animals not seen in at least ten years but not confirmed extinct.\n\nThe sturgeon’s disappearance coincided with the construction of Soviet-era dams that dramatically altered the Syr Darya’s flow. These barriers blocked access to upstream spawning grounds, permanently disrupted the river’s hydrology, and contributed to the collapse of the once-thriving ecosystem flowing into the Aral Sea.\n\nAll twenty-six existing sturgeon species are on the IUCN Red List of Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered or Extinct in the Wild. In Kazakhstan, the Syr Darya sturgeon sought by biologist Bernie Kuhajda (right) may already be extinct. Photo by David Guttenfelder\n\nA Legacy Endangered by Human Hands\n\nGlobally, the situation for sturgeons is dire. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 17 out of 25 known species are critically endangered, with one already extinct in the wild. Since 1970, global sturgeon populations have plummeted by 94%.\n\nTheir reproductive needs make them especially vulnerable. Sturgeons migrate long distances to spawn, and their larvae drift downstream after hatching. The construction of dams, widespread dredging, and river diversions for irrigation have destroyed these natural migration corridors.\n\nPollution from agriculture and mining has further degraded water quality, introducing toxic algae and sediment that harm both eggs and young fish. The Syr Darya sturgeon is not prized for its caviar like other species, but that hasn’t protected it from extinction pressures.\n\n“It took just two hundred years to destroy the entire river habitat of the sturgeons,” said Kuhajda. Today, even species that once thrived in free-flowing waters are trapped by human-made obstacles, both physical and ecological.\n\nRestoring a sturgeon population is a long-term task. These lake sturgeons from the St. Lawrence River in New York State can live for over 100 years, and only start reproducing between the ages of 15 and 33. Photo by David Guttenfelder\n\nA Final Hope for a Forgotten Fish\n\nDespite the grim outlook, Kuhajda and his colleague Dave Neely are pressing on. If they find a surviving population, they plan to follow a proven conservation protocol: capture mature individuals, fertilize their eggs in hatcheries, and rear juveniles for reintroduction. Hatcheries and juvenile transport programs have already been established in regions where spawning routes are blocked.\n\nKuhajda’s optimism was fueled during a roadside stop at a local fish seller’s stall. After showing images of preserved Syr Darya specimens, a fisherman claimed to have caught a similar fish years ago. This encounter added urgency to the search, reinforcing hopes that the species might still swim beneath the river’s murky surface.\n\nWith custom-made nets in hand, the researchers now comb the silty bottom of the Syr Darya. For a fish that survived 160 million years, its continued existence may now depend entirely on what they find."

            "content": "A bizarre hailstorm of icy “mushballs” — slushy mixtures of ammonia and water — has been confirmed on Jupiter, where intense lightning strikes illuminate these frozen slushballs as they rain from towering storms.\n\nUsing the first 3D visualizations of Jupiter’s troposphere, researchers revealed most weather is surprisingly shallow, yet deep convective systems punch through to unmix ammonia and water, dragging them far below cloud tops. This overturns the idea of a well‑mixed gas giant, with mushballs acting like subterranean conveyor belts that trap and transport chemicals, reshaping our understanding of giant‑planet atmospheres.\n\nMushball Slushstorms Unveiled\n\nPicture a giant Slushee™ made of ammonia and water, wrapped in a hard shell of ice. Now imagine these icy slushballs — called “mushballs” — falling through Jupiter’s atmosphere like hailstones, lit up by powerful flashes of lightning.\n\nAccording to planetary scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, this dramatic weather isn’t just science fiction—it’s actually happening on Jupiter. These mushball hailstorms, complete with lightning, may also occur on other gas giants in our solar system, such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—and possibly on gas planets throughout the galaxy.\n\nThe concept of mushballs was first proposed in 2020 to explain puzzling variations in the levels of ammonia gas observed in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere. These irregularities were detected by NASA’s Juno spacecraft and confirmed by ground-based radio telescopes.\n\nAt the time, UC Berkeley graduate student Chris Moeckel and his advisor, Professor Emerita Imke de Pater, were skeptical. The theory required very specific and extreme atmospheric conditions to work.\n\nFrom Skepticism to 3D Confirmation\n\n“Imke and I both were like, ‘There’s no way in the world this is true,’” said Moeckel, who received his UC Berkeley Ph.D. last year and is now a researcher at UC Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory. “So many things have to come together to actually explain this, it seems so exotic. I basically spent three years trying to prove this wrong. And I couldn’t prove it wrong.”\n\nThe confirmation, reported recently in the journal Science Advances, emerged together with the first 3D visualization of Jupiter’s upper atmosphere, which Moeckel and de Pater recently created and describe in a paper that is now undergoing peer review and is posted on the preprint server arXiv.\n\nThe 3D picture of Jupiter’s troposphere shows that the majority of the weather systems on Jupiter are shallow, reaching only 10 to 20 kilometers below the visible cloud deck or “surface” of the planet, which has a radius of 70,000 km. Most of the colorful, swirling patterns in the bands that encircle the planet are shallow.\n\nSome weather, however, emerges much deeper in the troposphere, redistributing ammonia and water and essentially unmixing what was long thought to be a uniform atmosphere. The three types of weather events responsible are hurricane-like vortices, hotspots coupled to ammonia-rich plumes that wrap around the planet in a wave-like structure, and large storms that generate mushballs and lightning.\n\nShallow Bands vs. Deep Storms\n\n“Every time you look at Jupiter, it’s mostly just surface level,” Moeckel said. “It’s shallow, but a few things — vortices and these big storms — can punch through.”\n\n“Juno really shows that ammonia is depleted at all latitudes down to about 150 kilometers, which is really odd,” said de Pater, who discovered 10 years ago that ammonia was depleted down to about 50 km. “That’s what Chris is trying to explain with his storm systems going much deeper than we expected.”\n\nGas giants like Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants like Neptune and Uranus are a major focus of current space missions and large telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, in part because they can help us understand the formation history of our solar system and ground truth observations of distant exoplanets, many of which are large and gaseous. Since astronomers can see only the upper atmospheres of faraway exoplanets, knowing how to interpret chemical signatures in these observations can help scientists infer details of exoplanet interiors, even for Earth-like planets.\n\nAtmospheric Mixing and Misleading Cloud Tops\n\n“We’re basically showing that the top of the atmosphere is actually a pretty bad representative of what is inside the planet,” Moeckel said.\n\nThat’s because storms like those that create mushballs unmix the atmosphere so that the chemical composition of the cloud tops does not necessarily reflect the composition deeper in the atmosphere. Jupiter is unlikely to be unique.\n\n“You can just extend that to Uranus, Neptune — certainly to exoplanets as well,” de Pater said.\n\nThe atmosphere on Jupiter is radically different from that on Earth. It’s primarily made of hydrogen and helium gas with trace amounts of gaseous molecules, like ammonia and water, which are heavier than the bulk atmosphere. Earth’s atmosphere is mainly nitrogen and oxygen. Jupiter also has storms, like the Great Red Spot, that last for centuries. And while ammonia gas and water vapor rise, freeze into droplets, like snow, and rain down continually, there is no solid surface to hit. At what point do the raindrops stop falling?\n\nSurface-less Rain and Vertical Mixing\n\n“On Earth, you have a surface, and rain will eventually hit this surface,” Moeckel said. “The question is: What happens if you take the surface away? How far do the raindrops fall into the planet? This is what we have on the giant planets.”\n\nThat question has piqued the interest of planetary scientists for decades, because processes like rain and storms are thought to be the main vertical mixers of planetary atmospheres. For decades, the simple assumption of a well-mixed atmosphere guided inferences about the interior makeup of gas giant planets like Jupiter.\n\nObservations by radio telescopes, much of it conducted by de Pater and colleagues, show that this simple assumption is false.\n\n“The turbulent cloud tops would lead you to believe that the atmosphere is well mixed,” said Moeckel, invoking the analogy of a boiling pot of water. “If you look at the top, you see it boiling, and you would assume that the whole pot is boiling. But these findings show that even though the top looks like it’s boiling, below is a layer that really is very steady and sluggish.”\n\nThe Microphysics Behind Mushballs\n\nOn Jupiter, the majority of water rain and ammonia snow appears to cycle high up in the cold atmosphere and evaporate as it falls, Moeckel said. Yet, even before Juno’s arrival at Jupiter, de Pater and her colleagues reported an upper atmosphere lacking in ammonia. They were able to explain these observations, however, through dynamic and standard weather modeling, which predicted a rainout of ammonia in thunderstorms down to the water layer, where water vapor condenses into a liquid.\n\nBut radio observations by Juno traced the regions of poor mixing to much greater depths, down to about 150 km, with many areas puzzlingly depleted of ammonia and no known mechanism that could explain the observations. This led to proposals that water and ammonia ice must form hailstones that fall out of the atmosphere and remove the ammonia. But it was a mystery how hailstones could form that were heavy enough to fall hundreds of kilometers into the atmosphere.\n\nTo explain why ammonia is missing from parts of Jupiter’s atmosphere, planetary scientist Tristan Guillot proposed a theory involving violent storms and slushy hailstones called mushballs. In this idea, strong updrafts during storms can lift tiny ice particles high above the clouds — more than 60 kilometers up. At those altitudes, the ice mixes with ammonia vapor, which acts like antifreeze and melts the ice into a slushy liquid. As the particles continue to rise and fall, they grow larger — like hailstones on Earth — eventually becoming mushballs the size of softballs.\n\nMushball Formation and Deep Descent\n\nThese mushballs can trap large amounts of water and ammonia with a 3 to 1 ratio. Because of their size and weight, they fall deep into the atmosphere — well below where the storm started — carrying the ammonia with them. This helps explain why ammonia appears to be missing from the upper atmosphere: it’s being dragged down and hidden deep inside the planet, where it leaves faint signatures to be observed with radio telescopes.\n\nHowever, the process depends on a number of specific conditions. The storms need to have very strong updrafts, around 100 meters per second, and the slushy particles must quickly mix with ammonia and grow large enough to survive the fall.\n\n“The mushball journey essentially starts about 50 to 60 kilometers below the cloud deck as water droplets. The water droplets get rapidly lofted all the way to the top of the cloud deck, where they freeze out and then fall over a hundred kilometers into the planet, where they start to evaporate and deposit material down there,” Moeckel said. “And so you have, essentially, this weird system that gets triggered far below the cloud deck, goes all the way to the top of the atmosphere and then sinks deep into the planet.”\n\nUnique signatures in the Juno radio data for one storm cloud convinced him and his colleagues that this is, indeed, what happens.\n\nRadio Evidence and Expert Confirmation\n\n“There was a small spot under the cloud that either looked like cooling, that is, melting ice, or an ammonia enhancement, that is, melting and release of ammonia,” Moeckel said. “It was the fact that either explanation was only possible with mushballs that eventually convinced me.”\n\nThe radio signature could not have been caused by water raindrops or ammonia snow, according to paper co-author Huazhi Ge, an expert in cloud dynamics on giant planets and a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\n\n“The Science Advances paper shows, observationally, that this process apparently is true, against my best desire to find a simpler answer,” Moeckel said.\n\n3D Tomography & Open Data Push\n\nScientists around the world observe Jupiter regularly with ground-based telescopes, timed to coincide with Juno’s closest approach to the planet every six weeks. In February 2017 and April 2019 — the periods covered by the two papers — the researchers used data from both the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico to complement Juno observations in an attempt to create a 3D picture of the troposphere. The HST, at visible wavelengths, provided measurements of reflected light off the cloud tops, while the VLA, a radio telescope, probed tens of kilometers below the clouds to provide global context. Juno’s Microwave Radiometer explored the deep atmosphere of Jupiter over a limited region of the atmosphere.\n\n“I essentially developed a tomography method that takes the radio observations and turns them into a three-dimensional rendering of that part of the atmosphere that is seen by Juno,” Moeckel said.\n\nThe 3D picture of that one swath of Jupiter confirmed that most of the weather is happening in the upper 10 kilometers.\n\n“The water condensation layer plays a crucial role in controlling the dynamics and the weather on Jupiter,” Moeckel said. “Only the most powerful storms and waves can break through that layer.\n\nMoeckel noted that his analysis of Jupiter’s atmosphere was delayed by the lack of publicly available calibrated data products from the Juno mission. Given the current level of data released, he was forced to independently reconstruct the mission team’s data processing methods — tools, data and discussions that, if shared earlier, could have significantly accelerated independent research and broadened scientific participation. He has since made these resources publicly available to support future research efforts.\n\nReference: “Tempests in the troposphere: Mapping the impact of giant storms on Jupiter’s deep atmosphere” by Chris Moeckel, Huazhi Ge and Imke de Pater, 28 March 2025, Science Advances.\n\nDOI: 10.1126/sciadv.ado9779\n\nThe work was funded in part by a Solar System Observations (SSO) award from NASA (80NSSC18K1003)."

            "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nSeismologist Deborah Kilb was wading through California earthquake records from the past four decades when she noticed something odd — a series of deep earthquakes that had occurred under the Sierra Nevada at a depth where Earth’s crust would typically be too hot and high pressure for seismic activity.\n\n“In Northern California usually the (earthquake) data goes down to about 10 kilometers (6 miles). In Southern California, they’ll go down a little bit deeper into 18 kilometers (11 miles),” said Kilb, a researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, referring to the depths at which earthquakes usually occur in those regions.\n\nBut the earthquakes she found taking place near the central region of the mountain range were up to twice as deep — and appear to be ongoing.\n\n“The fact that we see some seismicity that’s below 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) — like 20 kilometers to 40 kilometers (25 miles) — is very odd,” Kilb said. “It’s not something you would typically see in crustal earthquakes.”\n\nKilb flagged the data to Vera Schulte-Pelkum, a research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences and an associate research professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. Schulte-Pelkum was already studying the Sierra Nevada’s peculiar rock footprint, which had shown deep rock deformations within the same area.\n\nUsing the newfound data, the researchers imaged the Sierra Nevada through a technique known as receiver function analysis, which uses seismic waves to map Earth’s internal structure. The scientists found that in the central region of the mountain range, Earth’s crust is currently peeling away, a process scientifically known as lithospheric foundering. Kilb and Schulte-Pelkum reported the findings in December in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\n\nThe hypothesis lined up with previous speculation that the area had undergone lithospheric foundering, which happens when Earth’s outermost layer sinks into the lower layer of the mantle. Now, the study authors believe that the process is ongoing and is currently progressing to the north of the mountain range, according to the study.\n\n“We compared notes and realized that my strange rock fabric (the arrangement of rocks) signals and her strange deep earthquakes were in the same area,” Schulte-Pelkum said. “So then we decided to look at it more closely, and found this whole story.”\n\nWhat’s happening under the Sierra Nevada could offer rare insight into how the continents formed, Schulte-Pelkum said. The finding could also help scientists identify more areas where this process is happening as well as provide a better understanding of earthquakes and how our planet operates, she added.\n\nHow the continents formed\n\nEarth’s uppermost layer, the lithosphere, is made up of the rigid crust and the top part of the mantle, which is in a denser, but more fluid state. This layer also contains Earth’s oceanic crust — a thinner and denser layer below the oceans — and the continental crust that sits above this layer. But how these sublayers manage to exist in this ideal state, with the continents on top, is something of a mystery, Schulte-Pelkum said.\n\n“The continents just happened to be sticking up above the current sea level, luckily for us, because … they’re made of less dense minerals on average,” Schulte-Pelkum said. “To make it sit higher (in the first place), you have to get rid of some of the dense stuff.”\n\nLithospheric foundering is the process of the denser materials being pulled to the bottom, while the less dense material emerges at the top, resulting in land creation. “It’s dumping some of this denser stuff into this gooey, solid mantle layer underneath and sort of basically detaching it so it stops pulling on the less dense stuff above,” she explained.\n\nWithin the imaging of Earth below the Sierra Nevada, the researchers found a distinct layer within the mantle about 40 to 70 kilometers (25 to 43 miles) deep. This layer had specific imprints that gradually changed due north, the data showed.\n\nIf one were to have a block of clay that had spots of different colored clay throughout, and squeezed the clay between their hands, the spots would start to turn into stripes — this is similar to how the rock deformations appear, Schulte-Pelkum said.\n\nIn the southern Sierra, the dense rocks had the strongest inherent stripes and were shown to have already sheared away from the crust, whereas in the central region this process appears to be ongoing. In the northern Sierra, there are currently no signs of deformation. This distinct layer within the mantle would also explain the deep earthquakes Kilb found, as the crust in the central region is unusually thick from being pulled down and is also colder than the hot mantle material typically found at those depths.\n\n“Rock takes a really long time to warm up or cool down. So if you move some stuff, you know, by pulling it down or pushing it up, it takes a while for it to adjust its temperature,” Schulte-Pelkum said.\n\nEvidence for this process has been hard to come by. It is not visible from above ground, and it’s an extremely slow process. Scientists theorize that the south Sierra finished the process of lithospheric foundering about 4 million to 3 million years ago, according to the study.\n\nIt appears that these natural events happen occasionally around the world, Schulte-Pelkum said. “Geologically speaking, this is a pretty quick process with long periods of stability in between. … This (lithosphere foundering) probably started happening a long time ago when we started building continents, and (the continents) have gotten bigger over time. So it’s just sort of this punctuated, localized thing,” she added.\n\nOngoing debate\n\nThe Sierra Nevada has been a topic of debate for decades in the geology community due to an anomaly found within the mantle located underneath the Great Valley.\n\nWhile some scientists believe lithospheric foundering caused this feature, other scientists think it may be caused by subduction, which is when an oceanic plate sinks beneath a less dense plate, such as continental crust, and changes the landscape, said Mitchell McMillan, a research geologist and postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech, who was not involved with the study.\n\n“There are really two competing hypotheses to explain all these data, and you don’t really get that very often in geology. … So this paper is going to add to that whole discussion in a really neat way,” he said.\n\nFurther study within this area could also help scientists better understand how the Earth evolves on long timescales. If the lithospheric foundering continues underneath the mountain range, one can speculate that the land will continue to stretch vertically, changing the way the landscape looks now, McMillan said. But that could take anywhere from several hundred thousand to a few million years, he added.\n\nIn general, large mountain belts, or anywhere there is a batholith, is where you expect to find these events, McMillan said. The Andes, a long mountain range in South America, is an example of another place where scientists speculate lithosphere foundering once occurred and could still be happening today, he added.\n\n“I think this study in particular (highlights) the importance of tying together these different datasets,” McMillan said.\n\nBy better understanding this process, scientists can learn more about the functions of the planet and what happens beneath its surface, including the occurrence of earthquakes that have been linked to this process, McMillan said. Separately, the planet Venus, which does not have plate tectonics like Earth, has evidence of these lithospheric foundering events, and by understanding the process on Earth, we can start to apply it to Venus, he said.\n\n“It’s really fascinating to think about how you could be … hiking in the Sierra or in the foothills, or even anywhere else on a continent. And, you know, there’s stuff going on really deep underneath you that we’re not aware of,” Schulte-Pelkum said.\n\n“We sort of owe our existence on land to these processes happening. If the Earth hadn’t made continents, then we’d be very different creatures. … We evolved because the planet evolved the way it did. So just sort of understanding the whole system that you’re part of, I think, has value — beyond just less monetary damage and less human impact during, say, an earthquake,” she added."

The company has been saying \"late spring.\" Today, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel said they were told June. Several officials have suggested to Ars that the next launch will, in reality, occur no earlier than October. So when will we see New Glenn again?\n\nAs always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.\n\nPhantom Space delays Daytona launch, again. In a story that accepts what Phantom Space Founder Jim Cantrell says at face value, Payload Space reports that the company is \"an up-and-coming launch provider and satellite manufacturer\" and has \"steadily built a three-pronged business model to take on the industry’s powerhouses.\" It's a surprisingly laudatory story for a company that has yet to accomplish much in space.\n\nPutting the brakes on Daytona ... What caught my eye is the section on the Daytona rocket, a small-lift vehicle the company is developing. \"The company expects to begin flying Daytona late next year or early 2027, and already has a Daytona II and III in the works,\" the publication reports. Why is this notable? Because in an article published less than two years ago, Cantrell said Phantom was hoping to launch an orbital test flight in 2024. In other words, the rocket is further from launch today than it was in 2023. I guess we'll see what happens. (submitted by BH)\n\nIt appears the Minotaur IV rocket still exists. A Northrop Grumman Minotaur IV rocket successfully launched multiple classified payloads for the US National Reconnaissance Office on Wednesday, marking a return to Vandenberg Space Force Base for the solid-fueled launch vehicle after more than a decade, Space News reports. The mission, designated NROL-174, lifted off at 3:33 pm Eastern from Space Launch Complex 8 at Vandenberg, California. The launch was successful."

            "content": "Last year, Professor Richard Lieu proposed that there could be gravity happening even without mass. This proposal, outside the conventional understanding of physics, was to explain the effects of dark matter and dark energy, two hypothetical features that are at the cornerstone of the standard model of cosmology. Despite their importance, we have not found them; some people suggest that maybe they do not exist, and the error is in our misunderstanding of what actually does exist.\n\nLieu now has a follow-up proposal that seems even more dramatic. Dropping the possibility of negative masses and negative densities, the professor suggests the existence of transient temporal singularities: mini Big-Bang-like events that can flood the universe with matter and energy, disappearing just as quickly as they form.\n\n“This new paper proposes an improved version of the earlier model, which is also radically different,” Lieu, a physics professor at The University of Alabama in Huntsville, said in a statement. “The new model can account for both structure formation and stability, and the key observational properties of the expansion of the universe at large, by enlisting density singularities in time that uniformly affect all space to replace conventional dark matter and dark energy.”\n\nThe presence of these singularities would act like dark matter acts, adding an invisible amount of matter, five times the amount of regular matter that we know off. They would also exercise a negative pressure, just like dark energy does, pushing the universe into an accelerated expansion.\n\n“In the current theory, the conjecture is for matter and energy to appear and disappear in sudden bursts and, interestingly enough, there is no violation of conservation laws. These singularities are unobservable because they occur rarely in time and are unresolvedly fast, and that could be the reason why dark matter and dark energy have not been found. The origin of these temporal singularities is unknown – safe to say that the same is true of the moment of the Big Bang itself.”\n\nDark matter and dark energy are far from a perfect theory so it is good that they are challenged. Still, there are points of Lieu’s idea that are difficult to square with observations, like the existence of galaxies with less dark matter or more than the average. Also, we need testable predictions. If we can’t see them because they appear and disappear, is there another way to test their existence?\n\nThe study is published in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity."

            "content": "The Ambisonics algorithm generates immersive virtual soundscapes by utilizing a dome-shaped array of loudspeakers.\n\nSurround-sound systems can enhance a multimedia experience, but imagine a speaker setup capable of fully recreating a three-dimensional sound environment.\n\nEnter the AudioDome — not just a speaker array, but a dome-shaped structure designed to deliver immersive, 360-degree sound. When a listener sits at the center, the system can accurately reproduce the position and movement of sound sources from any direction.\n\nIn a study published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, researchers from Western University in London, Ontario, explored the capabilities of ambisonic sound reproduction using their custom-built AudioDome array.\n\nAmbisonic rendering is a way to simulate the precise locations of sounds in 3D, using an array of loudspeakers. The ambisonics algorithm has allowed researchers to create rich virtual “soundscapes,” with each sound appearing to come from precisely the location it occurred in the recording.\n\n“The ambisonics technology promises highly focal sound source reproduction which is enormously valuable to researchers wishing to maintain tight experimental control while also studying human auditory spatial perception in the type of complex, dynamic, three-dimensional soundscapes that the auditory system evolved to handle,” said researcher Nima Zargarnezhad.\n\nValidating Sound Perception in the AudioDome\n\nHowever, whether the ambisonics algorithm that the AudioDome uses to simulate soundscapes is appropriate for studying human perception is unknown. It depends on how precisely and focally it can simulate sound location, and how well it can reproduce the energy composition of sounds. Since Zargarnezhad’s team is interested in performing human experiments using the setup, they wanted to validate the effectiveness of the AudioDome’s ambisonics technology to simulate real life.\n\n“We already knew that some reconstruction errors were theoretically predicted and confirmed with simulations, but we did not know how and to what extent they would affect human perception of sound location and identity,” Zargarnezhad said.\n\nHuman-Like Spatial Acuity in Reproduced Sound\n\nOur ability to distinguish between stimuli in different locations, known as spatial acuity, is high in front of our faces but decreases around the sides of our head. The researchers’ experiments obtained very similar results from listeners in the AudioDome, proving that the loudspeaker array can reproduce sound locations at a spatial scale beyond the human limits of perception.\n\nThey also found that the accuracy and precision of a sound’s simulated location doesn’t depend on how far it is from an actual speaker location, which suggests that the spatial resolution of the ambisonics algorithm is appropriate for studying human perception nearly everywhere in three-dimensional space. However, they also observed that the ambisonics algorithm accurately reproduced sound energy up to about 4 kilohertz in frequency, sufficient to reproduce speech although it would sound somewhat degraded, as though heard over a telephone. They showed that the erroneous reproduction of higher frequencies fakes localization cues related to the perception of sound sources’ elevation, and sound sources with high frequency components are perceived from an unexpected altitude.\n\n“We conclude that the ambisonics algorithm can accurately reproduce the identity and location of many common sounds, including speech, at a spatial resolution that is at the level of human spatial acuity, if not better,” said Zargarnezhad. “This is sufficient to ensure the reproduced soundscapes are accurately simulating the real world.”\n\nReference: “Focality of sound source placement by higher (ninth) order ambisonics and perceptual effects of spectral reproduction errors” by Nima Zargarnezhad, Bruno Mesquita, Ewan A Macpherson and Ingrid Johnsrude, 15 April 2025, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.\n\nDOI: 10.1121/10.0036226"

            "content": "A groundbreaking discovery has rocked the field of neutrino astronomy—scientists have detected an ultra-high-energy neutrino using the KM3NeT telescope, with an energy level 16,000 times greater than the most powerful collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nThese elusive “ghost particles” provide a rare glimpse into the universe’s most extreme events, potentially originating from supermassive black holes or cataclysmic supernovae. The detection of this neutrino, possibly a cosmogenic one, could unlock new secrets about cosmic ray acceleration and the fundamental forces shaping our cosmos. However, more detections are needed to pinpoint its true origin and confirm its significance.\n\nChasing Ghost Particles\n\nOn February 13, 2023, an international team of scientists, including astronomers from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, detected a neutrino with record-setting energy using the KM3NeT telescope. This deep-sea observatory, spanning a kilometer in size, captured a signal 16,000 times more energetic than the most powerful particle collisions ever produced at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider.\n\nHow KM3NeT Captures Neutrinos\n\nNeutrinos are among the most elusive particles in the universe. They have almost no mass, carry no electric charge, and rarely interact with matter. “They are special cosmic messengers that reveal the secrets of the most energetic phenomena in the universe,” said Rosa Coniglione, then deputy spokesperson for KM3NeT.\n\nBecause neutrinos pass through most matter undetected, KM3NeT relies on seawater as its detection medium. Soon, the observatory will span several cubic kilometers, dramatically increasing its sensitivity. When a high-energy neutrino interacts with an atomic nucleus in the water, it can produce a muon—a heavier cousin of the electron that carries a negative charge. The muon travels so fast that it generates a cone of light, known as Cherenkov radiation, similar to the sonic boom produced by a supersonic jet.\n\nKM3NeT is designed to detect this light. The telescope consists of 230 vertical strings, each holding 18 spherical optical modules, resembling pearls on a necklace. Inside each module, 31 photomultipliers amplify even the faintest flashes of light from all directions. These instruments allow scientists to track the elusive neutrinos and uncover their origins, shedding light on some of the most powerful cosmic events in the universe.\n\nA New Era for Neutrino Astronomy\n\nKM3NeT is now detecting neutrinos from extreme astrophysical events, exploring previously uncharted energy ranges. “This first detection of a neutrino in the hundreds of PeV range opens a new chapter in neutrino astronomy,” says Paschal Coyle, KM3NeT spokesperson at the time of the detection and a researcher at IN2P3/CNRS in France. One petaelectronvolt (PeV) corresponds to 1015 or one quadrillion electronvolts.\n\nWhere Did the Record-Breaking Neutrino Come From?\n\nThe central question is where the high-energy particles that hit the Earth and react in its ocean or atmosphere come from.\n\n“By adding observations from other telescopes, we seek to connect the acceleration of cosmic rays, the production of neutrinos, and the role of supermassive black holes in shaping these energetic phenomena,” says Yuri Kovalev of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy.\n\nIn addition to the environment of supermassive black holes, supernova explosions are also among the candidates for powerful cosmic particle accelerators. The high-energy neutrino that has now been measured could come directly from such an accelerator, or it could be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino.\n\nCosmogenic neutrinos could be produced when other cosmic particles react with the weak light of the cosmic microwave background, creating extremely energetic neutrinos. However, since only a single event has been measured here at hundreds of PeV, the origin remains uncertain. To learn more, researchers need to detect more such events.\n\nHigh-Energy Particles from Space Are Nothing New\n\nA somewhat smaller neutrino telescope of the same design, Antares, has also measured high-energy neutrinos from space. And there are a number of other creative experiments that have captured the particle bombardment from space. Such as the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina, which also measures Cherenkov radiation. In this case, however, the initiators among the cosmic particles are protons that hit the Earth’s atmosphere and trigger cascades of secondary particles in it. The muons that are created in the process are not detected in seawater, but in over 1600 water tanks distributed throughout the Argentinean pampas.\n\nExplore Further:\n\nReference: “Observation of an ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrino with KM3NeT” by The KM3NeT Collaboration, 12 February 2025, Nature.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41586-024-08543-1\n\nA Global Collaboration to Uncover Cosmic Mysteries\n\nThe KM3NeT Collaboration is a large international effort involving more than 360 scientists, engineers, technicians, and students from 68 institutions across 22 countries. Together, they are working to detect and study neutrinos—tiny, elusive particles that can reveal powerful cosmic events.\n\nTwo Deep-Sea Detectors, One Mission\n\nKM3NeT operates two deep-sea neutrino detectors: ARCA (Astroparticle Research with Cosmics in the Abyss), located off the coast of Sicily, and ORCA (Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss), near Toulon, France. ARCA is designed to study high-energy neutrinos and consists of 230 vertical detection units, each about 700 meters tall and spaced 100 meters apart. ORCA, optimized for studying neutrino properties, has 115 units, each 200 meters tall with 20-meter spacing.\n\nEach detection unit holds 18 spherical optical modules, and each module contains 31 photomultipliers capable of detecting faint flashes of light produced by neutrino interactions. Data from both detectors are transmitted via submarine cables to shore stations: the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Sud in Portopalo di Capo Passero, Italy, and the Laboratoire Sous-marin Provence Méditerranée in La Seyne-sur-Mer, France.\n\nGerman Contributions to the Discovery\n\nSeveral institutions in Germany played key roles in the study that led to the discovery of the record-breaking neutrino. These include:\n\nFriedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg , with contributors M. Chadolias, Y. Darras, A. Domi, T. Eberl, T. Gal, N. Geißelbrecht, R. Gracia, K. Graf, C. Haack, L.

            "content": "Every plant leaf, eagle feather, and speck of pond scum spell out existence with the same four DNA letters. Ribosomes read that code, snap together twenty familiar amino acids, and pay each cellular bill with the energy token ATP.\n\nThat sameness keeps biologists chasing one big puzzle: if the instructions are nearly identical everywhere, who wrote the first edition?\n\nThe answer points to LUCA – the Last Universal Common Ancestor – an organism that sat at the split between Bacteria and Archaea.\n\nOne genetic code, one single ancestor\n\nLiving systems are not fond of coincidence. A single genetic alphabet, the same protein‑making machinery, and a universal energy currency add up to more than luck.\n\n“The evolutionary history of genes is complicated by their exchange between lineages,” explained Dr. Edmund Moody, lead author from the University of Bristol. His team sifted thousands of genomes to see how far back the shared toolkit stretches.\n\n“We have to use complex evolutionary models to reconcile the evolutionary history of genes with the genealogy of species.”\n\nBy letting the data, rather than strict cutoffs, decide which features belonged to LUCA, the researchers landed on roughly 2,600 genes – about as many as a run‑of‑the‑mill modern bacterium carries.\n\nCo-author Dr. Tom Williams noted, “One of the real advantages here is applying the gene‑tree species‑tree reconciliation approach to such a diverse dataset representing the primary domains of life, Archaea and Bacteria. This allows us to say with some confidence – and assess that level of confidence – in how LUCA lived.”\n\nLUCA’s developmental toolkit\n\nPrevious estimates swung from a lean 80‑gene outline to libraries topping 1,500 families. The updated theory paints LUCA as anything but a genetic ghost.\n\nInside those 2,600 blueprints are membrane pumps, DNA‑repair crews, and all the ingredients for simple lipids. Better still, the cache includes the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, a tidy chemical loop that welds carbon dioxide to hydrogen, spits out acetate, and releases usable energy in the process.\n\nSuch provisions point to a self‑reliant cell thriving without outside help. That picture challenges older ideas that early life was a stripped‑down passenger riding geology’s coattails toward complexity.\n\nInstead, LUCA seems to have been capable, adaptable, and ready to try new tricks the moment the planet cooled enough to keep liquid water in place.\n\nChemistry of hydrothermal vents\n\nTracking gene changes throughout Earth’s history, the study dates LUCA to about 4.2 billion years ago, only a few hundred million years after Earth itself pulled together.\n\n“We did not expect LUCA to be so old, within just hundreds of millions of years of Earth formation. However, our results fit with modern views on the habitability of early Earth,” said Dr. Sandra Álvarez‑Carretero.\n\nBack then, asteroid impacts and belching volcanoes regularly upended the crust. Yet seafloor hydrothermal vents likely offered warm, metal‑rich oases.\n\nIron, nickel, and sulfur minerals could have driven the very reactions scripted in LUCA’s genome.\n\nThe Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, still used by some present‑day microbes, fits neatly into that setting, turning vent chemistry into food and fuel.\n\nLUCA’s peace was short-lived\n\n“Our study showed that LUCA was a complex organism, not too different from modern prokaryotes. What is really interesting is that it clearly possessed an early immune system, showing that even by 4.2 billion years ago, our ancestor was already engaged in an arms race with viruses,” said Professor Davide Pisani.\n\nGenes resembling today’s CRISPR defenses suggest viral predators appeared almost as soon as cells did.\n\nThis constant sparring matters. Viral raids can shuffle genes between hosts faster than random mutation alone.\n\nThe pressure to dodge infection forces microbes to innovate, potentially speeding up the invention of new enzymes, pathways, and even entire metabolic lifestyles that later lineages would inherit.\n\nMicrobes sharing space with LUCA\n\nIt’s clear that LUCA was exploiting and changing its environment, but it is unlikely to have lived alone.\n\n“Its waste would have been food for other microbes, like methanogens, that would have helped to create a recycling ecosystem,” observed Tim Lenton from the University of Exeter.\n\nIn modern hydrothermal vents, acetate‑producers and methane‑makers trade leftovers, smoothing local chemistry and stabilizing energy flows.\n\nSimilar give‑and‑take could explain how early Earth cycled carbon and hydrogen long before photosynthesis took the stage.\n\nBy knitting together waste and resource, hydrothermal vent communities may have tempered extreme swings in temperature and acidity, opening fresh niches for the next wave of evolutionary experiments.\n\nWhy does LUCA matter?\n\n“The findings and methods employed in this work will also inform future studies that look in more detail into the subsequent evolution of prokaryotes in light of Earth history, including the lesser‑studied Archaea with their methanogenic representatives,” said Professor Anja Spang, co-author from the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research.\n\nProfessor Philip Donoghue highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of the work, saying it brought together data and techniques from across multiple fields.\n\nThis collaborative approach, he explained, made it possible to uncover insights into early Earth and the origins of life that no single discipline could have revealed on its own.\n\nHe also pointed out how swiftly ecosystems seem to have taken root on the early planet – an observation that opens the door to the possibility that life might be thriving on other Earth-like worlds in the universe.\n\n“This suggests that life may be flourishing on Earth‑like biospheres elsewhere in the universe,” Donoghue concluded.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nTo sum it all up, each genome pulled from ocean mud or desert crust adds a puzzle piece to LUCA’s portrait.\n\nAs sequencing tech grows faster and cheaper, scientists will keep hunting for ancient gene families, refining the ancestral blueprint, and scoping out early viral fossils hidden in microbial DNA.\n\nNew drilling missions aimed at untouched seafloor vents could reveal communities whose lifestyles echo those first biochemical gambles, tightening links between geology and genetics.\n\nThe storyline is still unfolding, but one takeaway already stands firm: life did not tiptoe onto the stage. It sprinted, armed with a full toolkit, ready to spar with viruses, and eager to reshape its surroundings – leaving every organism alive today carrying a hint of that four‑billion‑year‑old spark.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

The moment you open the box and see a left glove, you instantly know the other box has the right one.\n\nWith entangled particles, it’s like that, but much weirder. The twist is, unlike gloves that had a clear identity from the start, entangled particles don’t “decide” their state until someone measures them. And once one does, the other reacts instantly, no matter how far away it is.\n\nEinstein was never fully onboard with quantum entanglement because it seems to break the rule that nothing can travel faster than light.\n\nBut time and again, experiments have shown it’s real. No hidden signals. No delay. Just instant correlation.\n\nThe origins of entanglement\n\nEinstein’s collaboration with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen produced a classic puzzle that challenged existing ideas.\n\nTheir EPR paper helped spark deeper inquiries into how one particle can instantly affect another across vast distances, a phenomenon that puzzled even seasoned physicists.\n\nYears later, the idea reached practical horizons with quantum teleportation, which was conceptualized by Charles Bennett, Gilles Brassard, and Asher Peres.\n\nThis opened the door to quantum communication protocols that rely on bizarre correlations only possible in the quantum world.\n\nTiny photon spaces are revealing\n\nThe push to miniaturize devices is not just about saving space. Scaling down light-based components can strengthen the interaction between photons and nearby materials, which may lead to applications that larger-scale systems cannot achieve.\n\nPhotons in nanoscale environments showcase new combinations of properties. Instead of seeing separate spin and orbital components, scientists are dealing with total angular momentum, which merges these features into one quantity.\n\nStrange photon actions in small spaces\n\nMost people imagine light beams spreading out freely, but these experiments confine photons into structures tinier than a thousandth the thickness of a human hair.\n\nThat restriction forces angular components of light to overlap in unexpected ways, altering how each photon can carry information.\n\nThese observations may hold promise for new kinds of quantum devices.\n\nResearchers propose that total angular momentum entanglement might enable more compact hardware for quantum computing or communication links than previously thought possible.\n\nDifferent kind of quantum entanglement\n\nSeveral forms of entanglement in photons involve separate characteristics such as direction, frequency, or polarization. In contrast, total angular momentum combines many properties into a single description.\n\nEvidence for this new structure only surfaced when researchers tested how photon pairs behave once they pass through carefully designed nanoscale channels.\n\nThe outcomes hinted at correlations that do not resemble conventional entanglement structures in larger settings.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nThose studying photon-based technologies aim to construct more efficient equipment that harnesses quantum effects for faster computations or stealthy message exchanges.\n\nSmaller components can pack more operations onto a single chip, much like the ongoing trend in electronics.\n\nWhile some quantum methods focus on established particle attributes, this work suggests that total angular momentum could be an untapped resource.\n\nThe miniature systems explored by Technion scientists might offer fresh ways to encode and process data without taking up a lot of space.\n\nPhoton control and next steps\n\nEntangled photons, even in conventional systems, are notoriously sensitive to environmental disturbances.\n\nConfining light in tiny spaces can amplify those effects, so the engineering behind these setups must address potential losses or interference.\n\nResearchers also want to confirm whether total angular momentum entanglement behaves reliably in real-world conditions.\n\nInvestigations into materials and device architectures are underway, guided by the new data from these nanoscale experiments.\n\nEinstein’s skepticism about instant influence did not stop the scientific community from uncovering new frontiers in quantum theory.\n\nThe 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics recognized key contributions that shaped how we measure and interpret entanglement.\n\nToday, the focus has turned toward next-generation experiments that push these correlations into ever-smaller spaces.\n\nBy compressing photons into structures below their typical wavelength, scientists hope to uncover possibilities beyond familiar optical behaviors.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nEach step in quantum research sparks questions about how nature encodes information.\n\nThe notion of merging spin and orbit into a single total angular momentum points to a shift in the thinking about light, especially when devices must stay small.\n\nFurther studies may translate these findings into commercial products.\n\nMany experts foresee a path where photons replace electrons in computing tasks, leading to faster speeds and less heat dissipation. This new entanglement feature could become an essential piece of that puzzle.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Nature.\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

            "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nResearchers say they have uncovered evidence that early Earth was home to more hydrogen than previously thought, calling into question widely held beliefs about the origins of water and the evolution of our planet.\n\nScientists from the University of Oxford analyzed a rare type of meteorite known as an enstatite chondrite. The space rock dates to around 4.6 billion years ago and is believed to be similar in composition to early Earth, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Icarus.\n\nThe researchers found that the majority of the hydrogen contained within the meteorite was intrinsic, rather than being present due to contamination, suggesting that early Earth would have been home to sufficient hydrogen to have allowed the formation of water molecules.\n\nThis finding calls into question the widely held belief that hydrogen arrived on Earth in asteroids that bombarded what was previously a dry, rocky planet incapable of supporting life.\n\n“We assumed that Earth has water today because of quite a lucky scenario where it had been hit by these asteroids,” lead study author Tom Barrett, a doctoral student in the department of Earth sciences at the University of Oxford, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n“But what we’ve demonstrated in this study is that actually the material which formed Earth in the first instance actually did contain a lot of hydrogen and oxygen,” he added. “The discovery of hydrogen in this meteorite means that Earth potentially could have been hydrated or wet from its initial formation.”\n\nAs for why the levels of hydrogen identified in the study previously hadn’t been detected, Barrett explained the chemical element is hard to measure, particularly at such low concentrations. The detection was only possible thanks to a technique known as X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure, or XANES, spectroscopy, he said.\n\nThe enstatite chondrite is a rare type of meteorite that's believed to be similar in composition to early Earth. NASA\n\n“To do that you need a particle accelerator,” he said. “This is like an enormous, really expensive facility, which we’ve been very fortunate to have used to this study. But it’s not exactly the kind of experiment that you can do in the garage.”\n\nThe study potentially upends our understanding of early Earth, but the discovery of hydrogen in the meteorite doesn’t mean that life would have necessarily evolved sooner, Barrett said. This is because the habitability of a planet may depend more on the way it evolves than the material it is formed from, he said.\n\nHydrogen on early Earth\n\nA team of scientists at the French National Centre for Scientific Research had previously analyzed the meteorite, known as LAR 12252, which had been collected in Antarctica. The August 2020 study found that the space rock’s chondrules, or minuscule spherical objects, and organic material contained within it had traces of hydrogen. The research, however, only accounted for a portion of the hydrogen within the meteorite.\n\nThe researchers behind the new study believed more hydrogen could be attached to sulphur within the meteorite. The team unexpectedly detected hydrogen sulphide within the fine matrix immediately surrounding the chondrules — “on average almost 10 times more” hydrogen sulphide than found in the spherical objects, according to the study.\n\n“We were incredibly excited when the analysis told us the sample contained hydrogen sulphide — just not where we expected!” Barrett said in a statement. “Because the likelihood of this hydrogen sulphide originating from terrestrial contamination is very low, this research provides vital evidence to support the theory that water on Earth is native — that it is a natural outcome of what our planet is made of.”\n\nThe role of asteroid and comet impacts\n\nNext, Barrett plans to analyze more meteorites in an effort to ascertain exactly how much hydrogen would have been present on Earth, and how much may have been delivered from external sources.\n\nWorking out how Earth came to look the way it does today is a fundamental question for planetary scientists, said study coauthor James Bryson, an associate professor in the department of Earth sciences at the University of Oxford.\n\n“We now think that the material that built our planet — which we can study using these rare meteorites — was far richer in hydrogen than we thought previously,” he said.\n\n“This finding supports the idea that the formation of water on Earth was a natural process, rather than a fluke of hydrated asteroids bombarding our planet after it formed.”\n\nMatt Genge, a planetary scientist at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that while the study is an “interesting result,” the evidence is not sufficient to overturn the longstanding theory of the origins of water.\n\nThe meteorite in question had been in Antarctica likely for hundreds of thousands of years, he said, and it is impossible to completely rule out the chance that the hydrogen may have formed during that time.\n\n“Just the fact that there is a possibility makes the argument less strong,” Genge said.\n\nBryson acknowledged that the meteorite was indeed likely on Earth for many years before it was collected but stands by the study results.\n\n“We believe we have taken every effort we can in our analysis workflow to mitigate the impact of terrestrial water on our results, and we do think that some of the total amount of H (hydrogen) in the meteorite is due to Earth’s water (maybe about 15%),” Bryson said via email in response to Genge’s statement.\n\n“We also think that some H (hydrogen) was still delivered from asteroids and comets, however we now think this is a small proportion of the total H (hydrogen) found throughout our planet. So Matt’s assessment of this meteorite is justified, but we strived to minimise his concern.”"

However, for years, researchers have run into a problem when trying to quantify it: They haven't been able to find about half of that \"normal\" matter in the stars, galaxies and other space structures we can see.\n\nBut now, a large, international team of researchers has found that the diffuse hydrogen gas surrounding most galaxies is significantly more extensive than scientists previously thought — so extensive, in fact, that it could account for most of the universe's missing matter, the team says.\n\n\"The measurements are certainly consistent with finding all of the [missing] gas,\" study co-author Simone Ferraro , an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement .

            "content": "In northeastern China, paleontologists have uncovered two previously unknown species of feathered theropod dinosaurs dating back 125 million years. One of these fossils includes direct evidence of mammal predation—an unprecedented find that sheds new light on the behaviors and ecological roles of small carnivorous dinosaurs in the early Cretaceous period.\n\nExceptional Fossils From The Jehol Biota\n\nThe discoveries come from the Jehol Biota, a fossil-rich ecosystem in what is now Lingyuan. Known for its exceptional preservation, the site has yielded yet another set of remarkable specimens: Sinosauropteryx lingyuanensis and Huadanosaurus sinensis.\n\n\n\nBoth species were analyzed in a new study published in the journal National Science Review by researchers from the Natural History Museum of China and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nNew Genus and a Predator’s Last Meal\n\nAmong the most extraordinary aspects of the discovery is that Huadanosaurus sinensis represents both a new species and a new genus of small, feathered coelurosaurian theropods. Classified as compsognathid-like carnivores, these dinosaurs were compact, agile hunters.\n\n\n\nWhat makes Huadanosaurus unique is that its fossilized remains contain the skeletons of two ancient mammals—a complete eutriconodont and fragments of a eutherian.\n\nThis marks the first direct evidence of dinosaur-mammal predation ever found within the Jehol Biota.\n\n\n\nAccording to Qiu Rui, associate researcher at the Natural History Museum of China and co-lead author of the study, “Huadanosaurus had robust jaws and powerful neck muscles, suggesting it could swiftly kill prey through its strong biting force, enabling it to hunt mammals efficiently.”\n\nCredit: National Science Review\n\nDiversity in Hunting Strategies\n\nThe second species, Sinosauropteryx lingyuanensis, belongs to a previously established genus but is now confirmed as a new species due to several distinct anatomical features.\n\n\n\nThese include “a large oval concavity between the anterior margin of the antorbital fossa and the maxilla; large lacrimal recess on the lacrimal, U-shaped bifurcation at the posteroventral margin of the dentary, small and crescent-shaped external mandibular fenestra, and fan-shaped neural spine on the axis.”\n\nThe study’s large-scale comparison of 504 theropod species suggests that these sinosauropterygids form “a unique branch at the base of Coelurosauria,” according to Wang Xiaolin, researcher at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) and co-author of the study.\n\nThe Land Cracked, and Dinosaurs Adapted\n\nThe fossil record from this region is not only biologically rich but geologically dynamic. Tectonic activity during the Early Cretaceous led to the breakup of the North China Craton (NCC), creating rift basins that dramatically altered the environment. These disruptions intensified competition and forced evolutionary adaptations in many species.\n\n“In most Mesozoic ecosystems, a single dinosaur lineage occupied one niche,” said Zhou Zhonghe, another IVPP researcher and co-author of the study. “But here in Liaoning, sinosauropterygids evolved three hunting strategies, while distantly related groups like dromaeosaurs and tyrannosaurs overlapped in similar roles.”\n\nThis convergence of environmental transformation and biological adaptation likely contributed to the rapid diversification of predators in the region."

            "description": "As you experience or encounter new things, your brain must encode this information via the right neural networks at the right time.",
            "content": "Every day, people are constantly learning and forming new memories. When you pick up a new hobby, try a recipe a friend recommended or read the latest world news, your brain stores many of these memories for years or decades.\n\nBut how does your brain achieve this incredible feat?\n\nIn our newly published research in the journal Science, we have identified some of the “rules” the brain uses to learn.\n\nLearning in the brain\n\nThe human brain is made up of billions of nerve cells. These neurons conduct electrical pulses that carry information, much like how computers use binary code to carry data.\n\nThese electrical pulses are communicated with other neurons through connections between them called synapses. Individual neurons have branching extensions known as dendrites that can receive thousands of electrical inputs from other cells. Dendrites transmit these inputs to the main body of the neuron, where it then integrates all these signals to generate its own electrical pulses.\n\nIt is the collective activity of these electrical pulses across specific groups of neurons that form the representations of different information and experiences within the brain.\n\nFor decades, neuroscientists have thought that the brain learns by changing how neurons are connected to one another. As new information and experiences alter how neurons communicate with each other and change their collective activity patterns, some synaptic connections are made stronger while others are made weaker. This process of synaptic plasticity is what produces representations of new information and experiences within your brain.\n\nIn order for your brain to produce the correct representations during learning, however, the right synaptic connections must undergo the right changes at the right time. The “rules” that your brain uses to select which synapses to change during learning – what neuroscientists call the credit assignment problem – have remained largely unclear.\n\nDefining the rules\n\nWe decided to monitor the activity of individual synaptic connections within the brain during learning to see whether we could identify activity patterns that determine which connections would get stronger or weaker.\n\nTo do this, we genetically encoded biosensors in the neurons of mice that would light up in response to synaptic and neural activity. We monitored this activity in real time as the mice learned a task that involved pressing a lever to a certain position after a sound cue in order to receive water.\n\nWe were surprised to find that the synapses on a neuron don’t all follow the same rule. For example, scientists have often thought that neurons follow what are called Hebbian rules, where neurons that consistently fire together, wire together. Instead, we saw that synapses on different locations of dendrites of the same neuron followed different rules to determine whether connections got stronger or weaker. Some synapses adhered to the traditional Hebbian rule where neurons that consistently fire together strengthen their connections. Other synapses did something different and completely independent of the neuron’s activity.\n\nOur findings suggest that neurons, by simultaneously using two different sets of rules for learning across different groups of synapses, rather than a single uniform rule, can more precisely tune the different types of inputs they receive to appropriately represent new information in the brain.\n\nIn other words, by following different rules in the process of learning, neurons can multitask and perform multiple functions in parallel.\n\nFuture applications\n\nThis discovery provides a clearer understanding of how the connections between neurons change during learning. Given that most brain disorders, including degenerative and psychiatric conditions, involve some form of malfunctioning synapses, this has potentially important implications for human health and society.\n\nFor example, depression may develop from an excessive weakening of the synaptic connections within certain areas of the brain that make it harder to experience pleasure. By understanding how synaptic plasticity normally operates, scientists may be able to better understand what goes wrong in depression and then develop therapies to more effectively treat it.\n\nThese findings may also have implications for artificial intelligence. The artificial neural networks underlying AI have largely been inspired by how the brain works. However, the learning rules researchers use to update the connections within the networks and train the models are usually uniform and also not biologically plausible. Our research may provide insights into how to develop more biologically realistic AI models that are more efficient, have better performance, or both.\n\nThere is still a long way to go before we can use this information to develop new therapies for human brain disorders. While we found that synaptic connections on different groups of dendrites use different learning rules, we don’t know exactly why or how. In addition, while the ability of neurons to simultaneously use multiple learning methods increases their capacity to encode information, what other properties this may give them isn’t yet clear.\n\nFuture research will hopefully answer these questions and further our understanding of how the brain learns."

            "content": "What if everything we know—the stars, the galaxies, the expanding fabric of space-time—isn’t floating in a limitless void, but instead exists inside a black hole?\n\nIt may sound like a work of fiction; however, this theory is gaining increased traction thanks to fresh data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). If these findings hold, they might reshape our entire understanding of the universe.\n\nObserving the universe\n\nTo be able to collect credible data, JWST is mounted with an abundance of technology and equipment, allowing observers to peer into the vast reaches of outer space. The telescope is equipped with a huge golden mirror, enabling it to catch as much light, from as far away as possible.\n\nUnlike the Hubble Telescope, JWST is designed to detect infrared light. This feature is handy, as light from some of the furthest galaxies gets stretched into the infrared part of the spectrum, meaning it can view objects that are more than 13 billion years old—almost as old as the universe itself. There are plenty more intricate, complex features, but in short, the JWST is a giant, super-sensitive infrared camera floating around in space.\n\nGalactic rotation\n\nThe so-called “cosmic Russian doll theory” is driven by a striking observation made by the JWST. In an observation of 263 early galaxies, scientists found that many of them—about 80%—seem to rotate in the same direction. This discovery has puzzled scientists, as our current cosmological models state that the rotations of galaxies should be randomly distributed, with a 50-50 split.\n\nDespite the small sample size, this observation shatters existing frameworks, resulting in exciting breakthroughs. One idea explored by physicists like Nikodem Poplawski of the University of New Haven proposes that black holes do not just swallow matter into oblivion but may also give birth to new universes.\n\nBlack hole cosmology\n\nThis is where black hole cosmology, also known as “Schwarzschild cosmology,” enters the fray.\n\nIn this theory, within every black hole lies its own universe, and yes, that could include our own. The core idea entails that as matter collapses into a black hole, it does not simply condense down into an infinitely dense point (a singularity), as previously believed.\n\nRather, Poplawski posits that “the matter instead reaches a state of finite, extremely large density, stops collapsing, undergoes a bounce like compressed spring, and starts rapidly expanding.” Sound familiar?\n\nThe statement sounds like an alternative version of the Big Bang, which many scientists believe to be the birth of the universe.\n\nThe cherry on top to help prove this theory lies in the rotation of the observed galaxies. One of the few concrete things researchers understand about black holes is that they spin. If our parent black hole spun in a particular direction, the very fabric of our universe might have inherited that angular momentum, thus explaining the unusual galaxy rotation patterns JWST observed.\n\nCosmic theories with space to grow\n\nHowever, these concepts remain firmly in theoretical territory. Current technology has not evolved to allow for further research.\n\nIn other words, we cannot just send a probe past the event horizon of a black hole, as it will be destroyed. But JWST’s sharp vision is providing new clues that were impossible even a few years ago.

            "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — A bright object, initially appearing to be a meteorite, lit up the skies over Mexico’s capital around 3 a.m. Wednesday, stretching over plains, volcanoes and small towns.\n\nVideos of a ball of fire shooting over the Latin American country and dissolving in a burst of light over Mexico City struck awe in many — and quickly became the fuel for memes circulating on social media.\n\n“No, the meteorite that exploded last night isn’t an excuse to talk to your ex,” someone wrote on X, over a GIF of dinosaurs walking through a meteorite shower.\n\nSoon, photos of the fireball edited with cartoon characters and political jokes flooded the internet.\n\nScientists across Mexico were quick to note that the object rocketing across the skies was not a meteorite; it was a bolide.\n\nBolides, defined by NASA as fireballs, are “exceptionally bright meteors that are spectacular enough to be seen over a very wide area.”\n\nMario Rodríguez, a doctor in space science with the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said it could also be described as a meteoroid, or a fragment of a meteor.\n\nBolides like the one that coasted over Mexican skies early Wednesday catch fire as they descend to Earth.\n\n“Due to the great pressure on the object, they begin to flash with a stretching tail and emit light,” said Rodríguez, one of a group of scientists studying the videos that shocked many Mexicans. He said unlike meteorites, which impact Earth, a bolide disintegrates in the atmosphere.\n\nThis particular meteoroid, he said, was around 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length and posed no threat to the public.\n\n____\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"

The other four series -- Thunder vs. Grizzlies, Celtics vs. Magic, Cavaliers vs. Heat and Rockets vs. Warriors -- will have Game 1s on Sunday.\n\nThe Western Conference is full of intriguing first-round matchups this season. The seventh-seeded and battled-tested Warriors are favored over the second-seeded but relatively inexperienced Rockets. The Lakers saw the playoff debut of Luka Dončić, who scored 37 points on Saturday against the Wolves, but L.A. was burned inside. The 4-5 matchup between the Nuggets and Clippers could go either way with Nikola Jokić on one side and Kawhi Leonard on the other. Game 1 went to overtime in Denver with the Nuggets prevailing.\n\nIn the East, our experts expect it to be a chalky first round. On paper, the Cavaliers and Celtics should be able to take care of business against the Heat and Magic, respectively. The Knicks lost the season series to the Pistons, but New York is heavily favored to win this best-of-seven matchup and went on a key fourth-quarter run to take Game 1. Bucks-Pacers reignites a rivalry in the 4-5 matchup, but Milwaukee is without Damian Lillard to start the series.\n\nBut, as we learn each and every year, anything can happen in the playoffs.\n\n2025 NBA playoff bracket\n\nEast first-round matchups\n\nNo. 1 Cavaliers vs. No. 8 Heat\n\nNo. 2 Celtics vs. No. 7 Magic\n\nNo. 3 Knicks vs. No. 6 Pistons\n\nNo. 4 Pacers vs. No. 5 Bucks\n\nWest first-round matchups\n\nNo. 1 Thunder vs. No. 8 Grizzlies\n\nNo. 2 Rockets vs. No. 7 Warriors\n\nNo. 3 Lakers vs. No. 6 Timberwolves\n\nNo. 4 Nuggets vs. No. 5 Clippers\n\n2025 NBA playoffs: First-round schedule, scores\n\nAll times Eastern\n\nSaturday, April 19\n\nGame 1: Pacers 117, Bucks 98\n\nGame 1: Nuggets 112, Clippers 110 (OT)\n\nGame 1: Knicks 123, Pistons 112\n\nGame 1: Timberwolves 117, Lakers 95\n\nSunday, April 20\n\nGame 1: Thunder vs. Grizzlies, 1 p.m., ABC/fubo\n\nGame 1: Celtics vs. Magic, 3:30 p.m., ABC/fubo\n\nGame 1: Cavaliers vs. Heat, 7 p.m., TNT/fubo\n\nGame 1: Rockets vs. Warriors, 9:30 p.m., TNT\n\nMonday, April 21\n\nGame 2: Knicks vs. Pistons, 7:30 p.m., TNT/Max\n\nGame 2: Nuggets vs. Clippers, 10 p.m., TNT/Max\n\nTuesday, April 22\n\nGame 2: Pacers vs. Bucks, 7 p.m., NBA TV/fubo\n\nGame 2: Thunder vs. Grizzlies, 7:30 p.m., TNT/Max\n\nGame 2: Lakers vs. Timberwolves, 10 p.m., TNT/Max\n\nWednesday, April 23\n\nGame 2: Celtics vs. Magic, 7 p.m., TNT/Max\n\nGame 2: Cavaliers vs. Heat, 7:30 p.m., NBA TV/fubo\n\nGame 2: Rockets vs. Warriors, 9:30 p.m., TNT/Max\n\nThursday, April 24\n\nGame 3: Pistons vs. Knicks, 7 p.m., TNT/fubo\n\nGame 3: Grizzlies vs. Thunder, 9:30 p.m., TNT\n\nGame 3: Clippers vs. Nuggets, 10 p.m., TV TBD\n\nFriday, April 25\n\nGame 3: Magic vs. Celtics, 7 p.m., ESPN/fubo\n\nGame 3: Bucks vs. Pacers, 8 p.m., ESPNU/NBA TV/fubo\n\nGame 3: Timberwolves vs. Lakers, 9:30 p.m., ESPN/fubo\n\nSaturday, April 26\n\nGame 3: Heat vs. Cavaliers, 1 p.m., ABC/fubo\n\nGame 4: Grizzlies vs. Thunder, 3:30 p.m., TNT/Max\n\nGame 4: Clippers vs. Nuggets, 6 p.m., TNT/Max\n\nGame 3: Warriors vs. Rockets, 8:30 p.m., TV TBD\n\nSunday, April 27\n\nGame 4: Pistons vs. Knicks, 1 p.m., ABC/fubo\n\nGame 4: Timberwolves vs. Lakers, 3:30 p.m., ABC/fubo\n\nGame 4: Magic vs. Celtics, 7 p.m., TNT/Max\n\nGame 4: Bucks vs. Pacers, 9:30 p.m., TNT/Max\n\nMonday, April 28\n\nGame 4: Heat vs. Cavaliers, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 5: Thunder vs. Grizzlies, Time/TV TBD\n\nGame 4: Warriors vs. Rockets, 10 p.m., TNT/Max\n\nTuesday, April 29\n\n*Game 5: Celtics vs. Magic, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 5: Knicks vs. Pistons, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 5: Pacers vs. Bucks, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 5: Nuggets vs. Clippers, Time/TV TBD\n\nWednesday, April 30\n\n*Game 5: Cavaliers vs. Heat, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 5: Rockets vs. Warriors, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 5: Lakers vs. Timberwolves, Time/TV TBD\n\nThursday, May 1\n\n*Game 6: Magic vs. Celtics, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 6: Pistons vs. Knicks, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 6: Grizzlies vs. Thunder, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 6: Clippers vs. Nuggets, Time/TV TBD\n\nFriday, May 2\n\n*Game 6: Heat vs. Cavaliers, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 6: Bucks vs. Pacers, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 6: Warriors vs. Rockets, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 6: Timberwolves vs. Lakers, Time/TV TBD\n\nSaturday, May 3\n\n*Game 7: Celtics vs. Magic, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 7: Knicks vs. Pistons, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 7: Thunder vs. Grizzlies, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 7: Nuggets vs. Clippers, Time/TV TBD\n\nSunday, May 4\n\n*Game 7: Cavaliers vs. Heat, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 7: Pacers vs. Bucks, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 7: Rockets vs. Warriors, Time/TV TBD\n\n*Game 7: Lakers vs. Timberwolves, Time/TV TBD\n\n2025 NBA Play-In Tournament schedule, scores\n\nAll times Eastern\n\nTuesday, April 15\n\nMagic 120, Hawks 95\n\nWarriors 121, Grizzlies 116\n\nWednesday, April 16\n\nHeat 109, Bulls 90\n\nMavericks 120, Kings 106\n\nFriday, April 18\n\nHeat 123, Hawks 114 (OT)\n\nGrizzlies 120, Mavericks 106\n\n2025 NBA playoffs: Key dates"

And he says that makes him look at his job differently.\n\nAsked why he’s so eager to make trades during the draft, Roseman said it comes from having a different background and different mindset than most NFL executives.\n\n“That’s an example of being an outsider, and looking at the league when I was studying it, before I got into the league, and then coming into the league and understanding that there were opportunities to get aggressive,” Roseman said. “With that also comes risk. All those moves don’t always work out, and it’s probably more conservative just to stand pat, stay where you are, whether it’s with players on your team or during the draft, and see what comes to you. When you trade up in a draft, you’ve got to deal with the consequences of who ends up being there with the spot you move out of. Sometimes you say, ‘I could have sat there and got this player.’ So you have to deal with that, too. For me, being aggressive has always been part of my DNA, and I feel fortunate that I have the people around me who support that.”\n\nFew people with Roseman’s background have become NFL general managers, but no one can argue with Roseman’s results."

            "description": "Nico Iamaleava was Tennessee's star QB last season. He's already left in search of a better NIL deal in what some believe could become a trend in college football.",
            "content": "The University of Tennessee’s annual spring football game last week was supposed to be a preview of what to expect on the field.\n\nThe Volunteers were coming off a berth in last season’s College Football Playoff and returned the quarterback who led them there: Nico Iamaleava.\n\nBy kickoff, however, Iamaleava wasn’t welcome on the team anymore. And the reason why could be a preview of what is to come across major college sports.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Iamaleava was attempting to renegotiate the roughly $2 million he received annually in name, image and likeness payments to around $4 million when news of the discussions erupted into public view. And when Iamaleava did not show up for practice last Friday — a tactic described by some as a holdout — Volunteers coach Josh Heupel said he viewed the relationship as irreparably severed.\n\n“No one is bigger than the ‘Power T,’” Heupel said, referencing the school’s logo.\n\nIamaleava has since entered the transfer portal and is expected to join UCLA, The Athletic reported Wednesday, although his market value could have taken a hit. ESPN reported Thursday that “what UCLA was prepared to offer him wasn’t remotely close” to his $4 million target.\n\nThough the breakdown between Iamaleava and Tennessee was a product of elements unique to that relationship, it also stood out to experts as emblematic of broader changes that have virtually demolished the NCAA’s vow of amateurism, and in the process created a more fractious dynamic between college athletes and the schools they represent.\n\n“We are in a state of flux in college athletics right now,” Gabe Feldman, the director of Tulane’s sports law program and the school’s associate provost for NCAA compliance, wrote by email. “Even if the House settlement is approved, we are likely seeing the beginning of a new era of change and chaos, not the end.”\n\nThat power dynamic changed in 2021, when a unanimous Supreme Court decision ruled the NCAA had violated antitrust laws by blocking how much aid athletes could receive. And that summer, the NCAA allowed athletes to receive compensation for the use of their name, image and likeness for the first time.\n\nEven before his reported holdout, Iamaleava had already embodied the changing landscape of college athletics. He was one of the first players to cash in on the NCAA’s new rules allowing NIL in 2022, when he signed a deal with a collective connected to Tennessee worth a reported $8 million while still in high school near Los Angeles. When the NCAA began looking into potential recruiting infractions, Tennessee’s state attorney general sued the NCAA over its ban on using NIL inducements during recruiting — and won.\n\nTennessee’s attorney general celebrated that court victory in mid-March. Yet less than one month later, the quarterback whose recruitment was linked to the heart of the suit was headed out of Knoxville, this time as a different type of NIL trendsetter.\n\n“The case highlights the tension between the original intent of NIL (allowing athletes to monetize their personal brand) and what it has morphed into — essentially a pay-for-play system with compensation negotiations that increasingly resemble professional sports,” Darren Heitner, a prominent attorney who advises athletes and their representatives on NIL, said by email.\n\n“It is the byproduct of ignoring a free market that has developed without any protections for what for all intents and purposes are employers, because stakeholders refuse to recognize college athletes as employees.”\n\nNIL arrangements typically involve the athlete, their representative and the entity putting up the money, Heitner said, and such discussions often take place between an athlete’s representative and a collective, a third-party organization often made up of deep-pocketed university boosters that broker deals to avoid schools paying athletes — whom schools contend are not employees — themselves.\n\nRenegotiations have taken place behind the scenes before, Heitner said. Yet the Tennessee saga crossed into new territory, with the attorney saying that “the public nature and apparent leverage tactics used in this case represent a concerning escalation.”\n\n“What makes this particularly troubling is that we’re seeing what amounts to a contractual holdout, similar to professional sports, but without the legal protections and established processes that exist in professional leagues,” Heitner said. “This case crosses a threshold in that it so blatantly exposes how the current system can be manipulated, sometimes to the detriment of the athletes themselves when they do not have qualified and reputable people in their corner.”\n\nTennessee’s decision to stand firm was cheered by some — “If [players] want to play holdout, they might as well play get out,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal told reporters — while also criticized by former college championship coach Urban Meyer, who opined on a podcast that the school’s stand had left its depth chart “screwed.”\n\nTo Feldman, what amounted to a contract holdout in college sports “felt like an inevitability” in an era where college football players have long since begun skipping bowl games to protect their NFL draft prospects, he wrote by email. Holdouts over contract negotiations are already common in the NFL, and that is in a league with a collective bargaining agreement between the league and its players union, Feldman noted. Meanwhile, the NCAA’s power to govern has been significantly weakened in recent years after players and schools have successfully challenged old rules over eligibility and what players can and cannot accept.\n\n“College sports was one of the most strictly regulated environments in the country and is now one of the least regulated, so it’s not a surprise to see new conflicts arise between athletes and students,” Feldman said.\n\nThat weakened governance has led to gaps. Unlike the NBA and NFL, where players unions require would-be agents to pass background checks, rules exams and meet minimum standards for education to become certified, the NCAA has few guardrails to certify agents. That can lead to representatives who prioritize short-term gain, using poor strategy over positioning a player’s long-term best interests, Heitner said. And though some universities and their collectives have begun using contract templates, the language in NIL contracts can still vary widely, he said.\n\n“This inconsistency creates an environment where misunderstandings and disputes like the Iamaleava situation become more likely,” Heitner said.\n\nHow money is diverted inside college sports is expected to be changed even further once the House settlement, named for Grant House, a former Arizona State swimmer who is a lead plaintiff in the case against the NCAA, is approved. Under the proposed terms, schools will be allowed to share as much as $20 million in annual revenue directly with their athletes. The deal should “provide new oversight for college athletics,” Feldman said, “but there are still bumpy and uncharted waters ahead.” Still to be determined is where the House settlement will affect collectives’ and athletes’ negotiation power.\n\nThe standoff between Iamaleava and Tennessee was just one flashpoint between a school and a top athlete. But it only underscored the kinds of existential concerns Feldman has heard college athletics leaders discuss for years.\n\n“It has been clear that significant changes were coming to college athletics,” Feldman wrote. “Now that we are on the precipice of the biggest transformation in the history of college sports, most are unsure of how this new era will play out and whether college sports will remain essentially the same going forward or will be unrecognizable because of these changes.”"

            "description": "We can all go to bed now",
            "content": "The Dallas Mavericks season is over after the Memphis Grizzlies dominated them in the final Play-In game, beating the Mavericks 120-106 Friday night in Memphis.\n\nThe Grizzlies will be the West’s eighth seed and face the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Mavericks will go home.\n\nAnthony Davis led all scorers with 40 points, while chipping in nine rebounds, but it wasn’t nearly enough. Davis also left the game midway through the fourth quarter with a leg injury. Davis was battling through various ailments all night — throughout the game he was seen holding both his left and right legs, and also his midsection.\n\nMemphis jumped on Dallas early and it was never really all that close. The Grizzlies feasted in transition, turning the Mavericks over early and running constantly to get ahead of the Mavericks double-big lineup. It was nearly impossible for the Mavericks bigs to guard the rim because Memphis was in transition in the blink of an eye after a turnover or missed shot. The Grizzlies led 39-24 after the first quarter.\n\nFunny enough that was really all the Grizzlies needed. The rest of the quarters were closely contested, but due to how hard Memphis blitzed Dallas early, they were just maintaining a 15-20 lead seemingly the entire night.\n\nThe only glimmer of hope for Dallas was an 8-0 run to end the second quarter, which kept the lead at a respectable 17 instead of something much worse. That run extended to a 17-2 run at the start of the third quarter. Once the Mavericks were able to play in the half-court, they were able to stymie the Grizzlies momentum. Dallas had a chance to cut the lead to four midway through the third, but missed a three. Memphis regained its poise and closed the third quarter up 18. That was the death blow, especially once Davis left the game halfway through the fourth quarter.\n\nWe can all finally move on from this miserable turd of a season\n\nIt’s over. It’s all over. The 2024-2025 Mavericks will not play another game this season, capping off perhaps the worst-feeling season in the history of pro sports. Mercifully, Dallas fans can try to not think about the Mavericks.\n\nI know that sounds weird, but everyone needs a break. The players, the fans, the team employees, media, broadcasters, marketers, video producers — all of us. The Luka Doncic trade was so catastrophically stupid that it detonated an entire organization over night, and while for the most part the two main people responsible have hidden from the public eye, the rest of us are left either picking up the pieces or having to shield the team from that awful decision, whether anyone likes it or not.\n\nYou know who really needs a break? Nico Harrison and Mavericks owner Patrick Dumont. Those two need permanent breaks from the game of basketball. Maybe a lifetime ban.\n\nI can’t remember a season as awful as this. So many fans I know personally just don’t want to watch the team anymore. It sucks. While the season is over and that represents some reprieve, Doncic and the Lakers begin their playoff run this weekend. None of this will get any easier.\n\nThis game was a good summation of the post-trade Mavericks: they never really gave up, they mostly played hard, but they still stunk. Memphis is a team that can really only get it going in transition and playing fast, so the Mavericks did not protect the ball and let the Grizzlies run wild on the fastbreak. From there it was never really all that close, although credit the Mavericks for not totally rolling over. Again, they play hard and they never quit on coach Jason Kidd. But the roster has been nuked to holy hell and there’s no going back.\n\nAnthony Davis gutting it out and putting up 40, but also having to leave the game in the fourth quarter was an almost too on-the-nose foreshadowing of what the next era of Mavericks basketball is going to look like for the next three to four years, unless Dumont finally pulls the ripcord on Harrison’s reign.\n\nI don’t really have much else for y’all. I am tired, and this season has done irreparable harm to my desires to keep being a media person that covers the Mavericks. We’ll keep plugging away for now. See y’all on the other side."

            "content": "Ashton Jeanty has long been connected to the Raiders, and that remains the case as the countdown to the draft continues. It would come as no surprise if the Boise State back wound up beginning his career in Vegas.\n\n[RELATED: Raiders Add Jeanty In PFR’s Mock Draft]\n\nMany around the league are of the view the Raiders have “fallen in love” with Jeanty during the pre-draft process, CBS Sports’ Jonathan Jones writes. Vegas is among the teams which have hosted the Heisman runner-up, a sign of interest on the part of Pete Carroll, John Spytek and Co. One AFC executive went as far as telling Jones it is a “foregone conclusion” the Raiders will select Jeanty sixth overall.\n\nReplacing Josh Jacobs proved to be a challenge for Vegas last season. Zamir White – added during the fourth round of the 2022 draft – flashed potential as a starter late in Jacobs’ final Raiders campaign. That was not repeated in 2024, however, as White averaged only 2.8 yards per carry when on the field. He was limited to eight games last season, and a depth role should be in store for 2025, the final year of his rookie pact.\n\nVegas saw veteran Alexander Mattison depart in free agency, while the team brought in Raheem Mostert. The latter was released by the Dolphins in a move which did not come as much of a surprise. Mostert, 33, handled over 200 carries in 2023 but that figure plummeted to 85 last year. Expectations will be tempered after he signed a one-year deal worth just $1.6MM to join the Raiders.\n\nJeanty’s production and rushing efficiency improved during each of his three seasons at Boise State, and he amassed 2,739 scrimmage yards to go along with 30 total touchdowns in 2024. The junior handled 750 carries in college, so questions related to his mileage will no doubt be raised. Nevertheless, Jeanty has long been regarded as the top option in a very strong 2025 RB class.\n\nThe Cowboys – set to pick 12th overall – have also hosted Jeanty on a pre-draft visit, with the same being true of the Bears (who own pick No. 10). Chicago is seen as being high on the All-American, but it remains to be seen if selecting him will be possible. If the Raiders follow through with their expected decision, the Bears and all other RB-needy teams will turn their attention elsewhere during the draft."

            "content": "Since the signings of Jameis Winston and Russell Wilson in free agency, the possibility of the Giants waiting until after the No. 3 pick to add a quarterback has gained steam. Signs continue to point in that direction with less than one week remaining until the opening round.\n\nNew York’s final days of pre-draft visits has included work with a number of quarterback prospects, but taking any not named Cam Ward (long regarded as a lock to go No. 1) would be seen by many as a reach. Turning aside interest for the third overall selection would leave the Giants in position to select whichever member of the Travis Hunter-Abdul Carter pair remains after the Browns make their pick. Carter heads to New York in PFR’s first-round mock.\n\nDianna Russini of The Athletic notes the Giants appear to have a clear plan in place across the organization with respect to addressing the quarterback spot. That effort is unlikely to include the third overall pick, something corroborated by Jonathan Jones of CBS Sports. The latter notes taking a signal-caller at the top of the second round (New York owns pick No. 34) or trading up into the late Day 1 order remains on the table.\n\nA scenario in which the Giants draft Hunter and then pull off a trade-up maneuver to add his former Colorado teammate Shedeur Sanders has been floated as a possibility. Sanders’ stock appears to be falling compared to other second-tier quarterbacks, something which could make it easier for an interested team to acquire him outside of the top 10. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin has emerged as a Sanders supporter, though, meaning the No. 21 slot could represent his floor.\n\nRegardless of how Sanders’ draft process plays out, Jaxson Dart is a name to watch with respect to the Giants. Head coach Brian Daboll is a fan of the Ole Miss product, Fox Sports’ Jordan Schultz reports. Dart has frequently been mentioned as a potential first-rounder and a candidate to be the second QB to hear his name called. Schultz adds to the expectation Dart will come off the board during the draft’s opening night, a scenario which would require general manager Joe Schoen to make a move up from 34.\n\nQuestions loom about both Daboll and Schoen regarding their job security, and drafting a passer capable of operating as a long-term starter represents an obvious target entering a key 2025 campaign. Playing time will not be immediately available for a rookie added next week if things go to plan with the team’s veterans, but the pursuit of one of the class’ top options would come as no surprise."

            "content": "Trevor Story longed for the chance to be a healthy contributor for the Boston Red Sox.\n\nHe’s doing that so far this season and had his best offensive game of the season. The Red Sox shortstop slugged a pair of three-run home runs that sparked Boston’s offense in a 10-3 victory to open the four-game series against the Chicago White Sox.\n\nStory took advantage with runners in scoring position and set the tone for the Red Sox to cash in all night at Fenway Park.\n\n“It’s big, man,” Story told NESN’s Jahmai Webster. “Any time you come up with runners on base, you want to come through for the boys. Really just trying to keep it simple. Get a pitch I can handle. Took care of the mistakes tonight. I like that.”\n\n“Two good swings,” Alex Cora told reporters, as seen on NESN’s postgame coverage. “He’s such a good athlete that we’ve taken away the thought process. He has a plan going in, but we give him the license to swing. Sometimes, it doesn’t look good, metrics-wise. People are critical about it, but I’m not. I want him to be an athlete in position to attack and execute. He’s been doing that.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory can be another X-factor in the lineup with plenty of talent as the contributing bat that can take Boston to the next level. Cora hopes Friday is a reminder of the home run and stolen base threat Story presents with the Red Sox.\n\n“When he’s healthy, he’s 30-30,” Cora said.\n\n“That’s the way we want to do it,” Story added. “Get on the starter early, see if we can get into that bullpen. We put together great at-bats all game. That got us momentum. Lot of great swings by the guys tonight. That’s the type of offense we know we can be.”\n\nHere are more notes from Friday’s White Sox-Red Sox game:\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n— Story tallied a game with six RBI for the fourth time in his career, per NESN’s postgame coverage. The Boston shortstop did it once before in a Red Sox uniform on May 19, 2022, when he hit three home runs and drove in seven against the Seattle Mariners at Fenway Park.\n\n— Carlos Narvaez hit his first MLB home run with a solo shot in the eighth inning.\n\n— The Red Sox played their 50th game in their yellow “City Connect” jerseys and sport a 36-14 record in those uniforms, as seen on NESN’s postgame coverage.\n\n— Hunter Dobbins impressed in his second MLB start with six innings of one-run ball for another big-league win with the Red Sox.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n— The Red Sox and White Sox continue their four-game series Saturday afternoon. Boston’s Garrett Crochet gets another start against his former team while Chicago counters with Mass. native Shane Smith. First pitch is set for 4:10 p.m. ET.

However, Grand Rapids’ penalty kill stood tall, keeping Rockford off the board early. Both teams traded another penalty, but came up empty-handed, exiting the first frame knotted at zero.\n\nJust 4:50 into the second period, the IceHogs struck first when a giveaway at center ice allowed Rockford to skate into the Griffins’ zone 2-on-1 and Gavin Hayes took advantage. Then, at 9:07, Zach Sanford extended the IceHogs’ lead to two when he sent a pass out in front of Sebastian Cossa that deflected in over the line. With 5:39 left in the second, Dominik Shine took exception to a hit, suffering a double-minor penalty. Yet, Grand Rapids’ penalty kill unit outlasted the elongated call. The Griffins came inches from cutting into the lead with 1:46 to go when Sheldon Dries stole the puck for a breakaway chance, but Drew Commesso blocked it away.\n\nA huge scuffle at the conclusion of the second period resulted in 13 different penalties between the two teams, including ejections for Shai Buium and Anton Johnasson. The IceHogs ended up with a power-play opportunity to open the third frame. The Griffins killed off the penalty, but Rockford scored its third goal of the contest at 7:53 when Cavan Fitzgerald sent a rebound into the back of the net. With 7:47 remaining, Grand Rapids earned a power play and just 18 seconds later, Lombardi snapped a shot past the blocker of Commesso from above the left circle, putting the Griffins on the board late.

            "description": "The Braves looked dead in the water — until they weren’t. That’s baseball for you!",
            "content": "The Atlanta Braves looked down in the doldrums for the vast majority of this contest. That was until the lineup came alive with five runs in the eighth inning to pull off a major comeback in a 6-4 win over the Minnesota Twins.\n\nThe first two innings of this game felt like a typical April 2025 Braves game. The Braves smoked a couple of baseballs to start their hitting portion of the game but ultimately it was all for naught and as Alex Verdugo and Austin Riley both hit lasers directly into gloves. The Twins, meanwhile, saw their missiles from Carlos Correa and Ryan Jeffers in the second inning both find green. The double from Ryan Jeffers plated Carlos Correa from second base and the Twins were the first team to put something in the run column.\n\nJeffers was brought home, himself, by MLB debutant Luke Keaschall, who hit a blooper out into shallow right field for his first hit and first RBI in one fell swoop. Once the smoke was clear in that frame, the Twins were up 2-0 and it was looking this was about to be another one of those nights at the ballpark.\n\nSure enough, we were well and truly on track for another one of those nights because we got the Bryce Elder Special in the third inning. With two outs in the frame, Elder threw a change-up that was 85-mph and right in the heart of the zone. Trevor Larnach has been scuffling but once again, Elder gave the opposing hitter something to feast on with a big tasty meatball. Once it landed, it was 3-0 Twins and they weren’t done after that, either.\n\nThe fourth inning rolled around and Elder once again found himself in trouble as he gave up a double to Luke Keaschall that put runners on second and third with nobody out. Eventually, Keaschall made it home to score his first career run after Edouard Julien brought him in with a sacrifice fly. So now it was 4-0 Twins and at this point, the Braves didn’t have a hit as, naturally, the Braves were unable to figure out Chris Paddack in the early portion of this contest.\n\nThat first hit finally came in the form of the infield single, as Ozzie Albies finally gave the fans in attendance in Cobb County something to applaud from this lineup on the evening. Sean Murphy followed that up with a single of his own to move Ozzie into scoring position but (say it with me, now) the Braves failed to get a hit with a runner in scoring position once again. They went 0-for-9 in those scenarios during that woeful series finale against the Blue Jays and this was certainly an inauspicious start in that regard as this now made them 0-for-2 on the night in that situation.\n\nIt wasn’t until the fifth inning that we saw the Braves show some actual, tangible life at the plate against Chris Paddack. It came with one out in the frame, which is when it was Paddack’s turn to leave a change-up right in the heart of the zone to get crushed. The beneficiary was Jarred Kelenic, who drove one all the way out into the home bullpen in right center for a solo shot that got the Braves on the board. Atlanta was unable to get anything else going for the rest of that frame, so it remained 4-1 heading into the sixth inning.\n\nBryce Elder was done after five innings and this ended up being another one of those cases where the best thing you could say about Elder is that he covered five innings. Other than that, it was another one of those starts that featured him getting lit up with an inevitable hanger and giving up solid contact otherwise. If you had questions about why Elder was starting this game instead of AJ Smith-Shawver (who himself wasn’t exactly spectacular during his start in Triple-A Gwinnett tonight), I understand and you definitely wouldn’t be alone in that regard. Either way, the Braves had some work to do once Elder was gone and Aaron Bummer at least did a good job of delivering the first 1-2-3 inning of the night for Braves pitchers in this one.\n\nPerhaps feeling like they didn’t want to press their luck any further, the Twins decided that they were happy with five innings of just one run allowed and five strikeouts over 88 pitches from Chris Paddack and called upon their formidable bullpen to finish off the rest of the contest. Louis Varland was the first man out of Minnesota’s ‘pen and outside of walking Ozzie Albies with one out, the sixth came and went with little as far as incident was concerned. The same happened during the seventh inning — Danny Coulombe entered the game and gave up a single to Michael Harris II but that was the extent of the damage that the Braves did in that frame as well.\n\nFollowing Aaron Bummer’s exit from the game in the seventh, Enyel De Los Santos came on and held the Twins at four runs through the eighth inning as well. At this point, the onus was on Atlanta’s lineup to figure out something against Minnesota’s bullpen. That’s a lot easier said than done considering that Griffin Jax was yet another tough customer that this bullpen has to offer. However, the Braves got something going with one out when Marcell Ozuna walked and then Matt Olson followed that up with a single to right. Ozzie Albies then hit a grounder that the Twins didn’t exactly field in the most efficient way and that allowed Ozzie to make it to first and Ozuna to make it home. Suddenly, both the tying and go-ahead runs were on the basepaths with Sean Murphy at the plate. Murphy walked, which meant that the Braves had a golden opportunity with the bases loaded and one out.\n\nMichael Harris II got the first crack at it against new pitcher Cole Sands and he didn’t disappoint, as he scalded one towards first base. This time, the ball did not end up directly inside the mitt of a defender’s glove — instead, it bounced off of Edouard Julien’s glove and into the outfield for a game-tying RBI single. After spending most of this game wandering in the wilderness in front of a dead crowd, the Braves had tied it up and the crowd was jumping.\n\nDrake Baldwin entered the game as a pinch hitter for Nick Allen and suddenly it turned into another golden opportunity after Michael Harris II stole second with basically no resistance. That ended up being crucial, as Baldwin shot one right up the middle for a go-ahead two-RBI single and what had been an incredibly dull night for this team suddenly transformed into one of those vintage eighth-inning comebacks that we had grown used to seeing in recent times. The Braves were not only alive in this game, they were alive and well with the lead in hand — and actually had some insurance as well once Raisel Iglesias entered the game for the ninth inning.\n\nRaisel Iglesias proceeded to sit down the Twins in order and in what felt like the blink of an eye, a dull loss turned into an exhilarating win for the Braves. This was a prime example of just how quickly any given game can change and fortunately, this was one of those instances where fortune ended up favoring the Braves in this one.\n\nWe’ll see if the Braves will be able to keep the good vibes going in the right direction as Chris Sale will look to make it happen and finally find his groove, starting at 7:15 p.m. ET."

After enjoying a moment with his brother Leon Edwards in the cage, Fabian turned his attention to his next opponent Josh Silveira, who was also victorious earlier in the night.\n\n“I feel good but the job’s not done,” Edwards said about his win. “One down, two more to go. I can’t get too happy. PFL you should have brought in elbows a long time ago.”\n\nIn the co-main event, 2024 PFL champion Gadzhi Rabadanov continued his reign of terror in the lightweight division after demolishing ex-UFC fighter Marc Diakiese in just 32 seconds.\n\nThe fight barely got started when Diakiese threw a kick that Rabadanov caught before tripping up his opponent and bringing the fight to the ground. From there, Rabadanov unloaded punches in succession and Diakiese didn’t know what hit him before he just fell limp from the damaging shots.\n\nIt was a stunning sequence with Rabadanov securing yet another knockout win while moving forward in the PFL tournament where he now faces Jay Jay Wilson in the second round.\n\nDalton Rosta dominated and eventually finished PFL veteran Sadibou Sy in a statement performance as he moved forward in the middleweight tournament. While Sy is well known for his striking acumen, it was Rosta who clipped him with a hard punch in the second round that eventually ended with the fighters on the floor.\n\nConstantly attacking with punches and submission attempts, Rosta finally saw an opening to latch onto a D’arce choke. Once he tightened his grip there was no escape and Sy fell unconscious from the choke, which stopped the fight.\n\nWilson punched his ticket to the semifinals in the lightweight tournament after a punishing performance against Mads Burnell. While he was cruising towards a unanimous decision win, Wilson just kept chipping away until he got Burnell trapped underneath him and he started dropping bombs.\n\nWith each punch landed, Burnell faded just a little bit more and Wilson wasn’t slowing down until the referee pulled him off. It was an impressive performance as Wilson just overwhelmed Burnell and then finally earned the finish late in the third and final round.\n\nIn the opening bout on the main card, Alfie Davis surprised multi-time PFL veteran Clay Collard with a perfectly timed spinning back elbow that cracked him in the head. Collard was immediately wobbled but he still managed to keep coming despite being dropped momentarily.\n\nTHE REPLAY!

In a corresponding move, infielder Nicky Lopez has been designated for assignment.\n\nLopez, 30, signed with the Halos just before Opening Day. He had signed a minor league deal with the Cubs in the winter but opted out of that pact when he wasn’t going to break camp with the Cubbies.\n\nFor the Angels, they were looking to cover up for a number of infield injuries. Neto underwent shoulder surgery in November and was going to miss the early portions of the 2025 season. Third baseman Anthony Rendon required hip surgery in February and is going to be out of action for a while. To help fill in the infield depth, the club brought in Lopez, Yoán Moncada, Tim Anderson, Kevin Newman and J.D. Davis. Moncada has also been hurt and is currently on the IL due to a thumb sprain.\n\nDespite all of the injuries, Lopez hasn’t really received any playing time. He has six plate appearances across five games, not reaching base in any of them. Anderson had taken over the shortstop position. He didn’t hit much but his glovework received decent grades in his small sample of work. With Neto’s return, he’ll be downgraded into a bench role anyhow. Luis Rengifo is holding down third while Kyren Paris is having a breakout, taking over the second base position while hitting .326/.426/.717.\n\nLopez already seemed somewhat superfluous on the roster, with Neto’s return squeezing him out even further. The Angels will now technically have a week of DFA limbo time to figure out what’s next, but Lopez has enough service time to reject an outright assignment, so he seems likely to be a free agent within a week’s time.\n\nGenerally speaking, he’s been a light-hitting glove-first infielder in his career. He has a .247/.311/.313 batting line in 2,352 big league plate appearances, with that line translating to a 73 wRC+. Reviews on his shortstop glovework are mixed as he has -11 Defensive Runs Saved but 33 Outs Above Average. He also has lots of experience at the other infield positions with good marks there, and some brief left field work as well.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Troy Taormina, Imagn Images"

Redshirt sophomore Ryan Browne will transfer back to Purdue from North Carolina, a source told Boiler Upload.\n\nBrowne was one of the bigger portal departures of the off-season for the Boilermakers, when he entered on the heels of the coaching change in West Lafayette. The redshirt sophomore spent two years at Purdue and produced some dazzling moments last season, where he had 532 passing yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions, as well as 155 yards on the ground.\n\nHis career-best performance came against Illinois, as he threw for 297 yards and three touchdowns, while also rushing for 118 yards in a 50-49 overtime loss to the then No. 23 ranked Illini in Champaign. Browne also got the start against Oregon the following week, which saw the Boilermakers get shut out for the first of three times last season. When Hudson Card returned from injury against Northwestern, Browne was relegated to the backup role for the rest of the regular season.\n\nBrowne entered the portal after spending the spring with Bill Belichick and North Carolina, who just landed South Alabama transfer quarterback Gio Lopez earlier this week.\n\nBrowne now re-enters a quarterback room without a leader after spring practice, as Malachi Singleton, Evans Chuba and Bennett Meredith battled throughout the spring, but none of the four were able to cement themselves atop the depth chart for offensive coordinator Josh Henson. Browne will have the opportunity to do so as he returns to West Lafayette for his second stint with the Boilermakers.\n\nWith the addition, or welcoming back of Browne, Purdue stays true to the prototype it wants out of its signal callers. Browne offers a true dual threat option under center for offensive coordinator Josh Henson and quarterbacks coach Darin Hinshaw.\n\nBrowne becomes the 35th portal addition of the off-season for the Boilermakers and the third in the spring window, joining Bowling Green defensive tackle Marcus Moore Jr. and Tennessee State linebacker Sanders Ellis."

            "content": "I was just 15-20 minutes into writing this when the Rays placed Richie Palacios back on the injured list and selected the contract of prospect Chandler Simpson, widely regarded as the fastest player in the sport. Simpson swiped 104 bags in 110 minor league games last year. He was caught only 13 times. He's 8-for-11 in steals to begin the current season. He's struck out in fewer than 10% of his professional plate appearances. Simpson has virtually no power, but he's an oddity in today's game and a throwback to the leadoff hitters of yesteryear. If he can carry those wheels and that preternatural contact ability over to the majors, he's going to garner a lot of national attention, simply because he's a departure from the MLB archetype in an era of baseball that's increasingly focused on power, elevating the ball, exit velocity, etc.\n\nMaybe Simpson will be a star for the Rays. Maybe he'll follow the Billy Hamilton career path. We can't know yet. He hasn't played a single big league game. But even without the promotion of a notable prospect, the Rays' future was already starting to look quite bright.\n\nWe're early in the 2025 season, of course, so lots of things can be chalked up to small sample sizes. And the Rays do have plenty of early small-sample success stories. It hasn't yet translated into winning ball, evidenced by their 8-11 record, but Tampa Bay has a +11 run differential and has spent a good portion (in some cases all) of the season playing without some key stars. Shane McClanahan is wrapping up his rehab from Tommy John surgery. Josh Lowe has been out almost all year with a strained oblique. Ha-Seong Kim was signed knowing that he'd be out into at least May following shoulder surgery. The version of the Rays that president of baseball operations Erik Neander and manager Kevin Cash trot out in June and July should be expected to look quite a bit different than the April version.\n\nThere are still some intriguing names on the roster right now, however, many of whom are flying too far under the radar. It's easy to get too caught up in early-season data, as it tends to balance out over a larger sample. But with many of the Rays' young and/or returning contributors, the breakout campaigns they're teasing date back to the second half of the 2024 season. Tampa Bay operated as a seller last summer, trading away veterans Zach Eflin, Jason Adam, Isaac Paredes, Randy Arozarena, Aaron Civale and Phil Maton, among others.\n\nThat opened the door for a wave of younger players to begin receiving more playing time, and if you trace things back to that point, some of these eye-opening March/April stats start to look a little more legitimate. It's still only about 40% of a season -- less than that in some cases -- but as is always the case with a Rays team that ebbs and flows through periods of contending and rebuilding on the fly, there are some very intriguing components of a core taking shape.\n\nLet's run through a few particular standouts."

There were several naysayers, but Becky Hammon became the most notable by declaring Brunson as “too small” to carry a franchise to great heights.\n\nHistorically, she was only partially correct. Steph Curry is taller than Brunson by a couple of inches but hardly a giant. Height didn’t stop him from winning four titles. Allen Iverson is Brunson’s size and took the Sixers to the NBA Finals nearly 25 years ago, basically as a one-man offense.\n\nShorty Brunson? He bucked the stereotypes with a 2024 statistical playoff stretch rivaling Michael Jordan’s best, dragging the injury-detonated Knicks beyond reasonable expectations but still falling one win short of clearing that nettlesome second-round hurdle.\n\n3 Jalen Brunson addresses reporters during a press conference on 15. Charles Wenzelberg\n\nThe response from the Knicks’ front office was to double down on Brunson — perhaps triple down is more appropriate. They sprinted to sign his team-friendly extension. They named him captain, even opening MSG in August for a ceremony. They changed the roster to fit around the point guard, either acquiring or re-signing pieces who allowed Brunson to command the ball and flourish."

            "content": "San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York made headlines earlier this month when he called Brock Purdy a top-10 NFL quarterback. The timing raised eyebrows, as the team is currently engaged in contract negotiations with Purdy. Some speculated that York's comments could bolster the quarterback's case at the bargaining table.\n\nMatt Maiocco of NBC Sports Bay Area joined KNBR on Friday and was asked whether York's remarks may have negatively affected the 49ers in negotiations.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Maiocco replied. \"I think that Brock Purdy's performance is what his side is using for these negotiations.\"\n\nMaiocco pointed out that York's top-10 quarterback comment was partially based on Purdy's fit within Kyle Shanahan's system and the talent surrounding him in San Francisco.\n\nAn optimistic York also said, \"I have every hope and every expectation that Brock is going to be a Forty-Niner for a long, long time.\"\n\nPublicly declaring Purdy a top-10 quarterback likely won't significantly influence his market value. Most expect Purdy's new deal to exceed $51 million annually, a figure the 49ers have been preparing for. This offseason, the team parted ways with several key contributors to reduce future spending and make room for what's expected to be the largest contract in franchise history.\n\nMaiocco noted that Jalen Hurts of the Philadelphia Eagles currently ranks as the 10th highest-paid quarterback, with an annual salary of $51 million, suggesting that number could possibly serve as a benchmark for Purdy's deal.\n\nOf course, Purdy's camp may see things differently. After all, Hurts signed his deal in 2023.\n\n\"Since then, the salary cap has risen dramatically,\" Maiocco explained. \"And so, I'm sure Brock Purdy's side is looking at it like, 'Okay, that was $51 million, but that was when the cap was there, so therefore, that represents that percentage of the salary cap, and that percentage of the salary cap now is this high.' So it's, it's a back and forth.\"\n\nIn 2023, the NFL salary cap was $224.8 million per team, meaning Hurts' $51 million salary represented roughly 22.7% of that total. Applying that same percentage to the current $279.2 million cap would result in an annual salary just north of $63 million, surpassing the NFL-leading salary of Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott.\n\nWhile it's unlikely the 49ers go that high, the comparison remains intriguing as both sides continue working toward a long-term deal. Maiocco expressed doubt that the final number will reach $60 million per year, but could it come in as low as $50 million?\n\n\"I kind of doubt that, too,\" Maiocco said. \"I think it's got to be somewhere there, but that's still a lot of room. That's a $9 million span of where that thing could fit in.\"\n\nMaiocco added, \"When you have a player like that, that checks all the boxes and that everybody loves, and he's been underpaid, I think something will get done. I'd be really surprised if it doesn't. And I would think that, organized team activities, when they're getting on the field, all that, that would be probably the time that both sides would come together and say, 'Let's stop fooling around here, and let's just get something done.'\"\n\nYou can listen to Maiocco's entire interview below."

I love Los Angeles and LAFC, but this move is in the best interest of my family, even as it will ultimately take us away from a team, city, organization and fan base that I am proud to represent.\n\nThe San Diego native has an 87W-43L-26D record with LAFC across all competitions and has reached six finals.\n\nCherundolo was named as Bob Bradley's successor in January 2022, leading the Black & Gold to that year's MLS Cup-Supporters' Shield double. He also won the 2024 US Open Cup title and reached the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup final.\n\n\"For the remainder of 2025, our goals have not changed.

We believe we have the people to make that happen, and there will be no better way to close this chapter than with another trophy for LAFC.”\n\n“Steve has been a tremendous leader for LAFC and has proven to be one of the top coaches in our league,” co-president & general manager John Thorrington said. “What he has achieved during his tenure speaks for itself, and we are extremely thankful to him for his continued dedication and hard work. We support his decision to focus on his family with this move at the end of the season.\n\nThe club's second-ever manager, Cherundolo was a 2022 MLS Sigi Schmid Coach of the Year finalist after guiding the Black & Gold to the seventh (and most recent) MLS Cup-Supporters' Shield double in league history.\n\nA statement from the Club. LAFC Head Coach Steve Cherundolo announced today that he will step down from his position at the completion of the 2025 MLS season.\n\nA former US men’s national team and Bundesliga defender, Cherundolo previously led USL Championship side Las Vegas Lights and held various roles in Germany.\n\n“It has been a pleasure working with and building a strong relationship with Steve over these last few years, and I thank him for everything he has given to the club,” lead managing owner Bennett Rosenthal said.\n\n“Steve has built upon the foundation of the Black & Gold standard, and we wish him success with us for the rest of this season and in his future endeavors. We appreciate and respect Steve’s desire to move with his family at the end of this season. On behalf of myself, Brandon Beck, Larry Berg and our other owners, I can assure you that Steve will always be a part of our LAFC family.”\n\nLAFC currently sit seventh in the Western Conference with a 4W-4L-0D record (12 points) and exited the 2025 CCC earlier this month after their quarterfinal loss to Inter Miami CF. They will also participate in this year's Leagues Cup tournament."

The Haslams also own the Browns.\n\n\"This is a unique moment in time with Messi where we can fill the building and ensure that the first experience that Northeast Ohio has with the Columbus Crew is in a packed house,\" said Josh Glessing, the Haslam Sports Group's chief of strategy development who is also the Crew's president of business operations.\n\nIt will be the 11th match in MLS that Messi has played in an NFL stadium since he arrived in Miami in 2023 after captaining Argentina to the 2022 World Cup title. It is the second time that a club has moved it to a larger facility. The previous matches - nine regular season and one playoff -- averaged 61,507 fans.\n\nLast year, Sporting Kansas City drew 72,610 when they played Inter Miami at Arrowhead Stadium instead of their home field, which has a capacity of 18,467.\n\nAtlanta United, Charlotte FC, the Chicago Fire and New England Revolution play in NFL facilities. Last Sunday's scoreless draw at Chicago's Soldier Field had a crowd of 62,358, a single-game record for the Fire.\n\nThe Crew expect to set a single-game record, surpassing the 31,550 it drew for a 1996 match at Ohio Stadium against the New York-New Jersey MetroStars.\n\n\"For Inter Miami to travel around Major League Soccer and for us to be able to take that game into big stadiums and sell them out speaks to the impact he has on Major League Soccer and on the sport. But there's also an exciting legacy impact that I don't think a lot of people have realized yet,\" MLS executive vice president Camilo Durana said.\n\nThe Columbus Crew are expecting a club-record crowd when it welcomes Inter Miami and Lionel Messi to Cleveland's Huntington Bank Field. Nick Cammett/Diamond Images via Getty Images)\n\nNot everyone is happy with the move, however. Crew supporters' group, the Nordecke, announced Thursday that it would not be providing equipment or its traditional chant-leading capos for the game, having initially voiced their disappointment with the decision to play in Cleveland when it was announced in December.\n\nCleveland and Northeast Ohio do have a soccer history of their own. The Force of the defunct Major Indoor Soccer League was one of the top-drawing teams during the league's heyday in the 1980s.\n\nRecently, the region has been fertile ground for youth and club teams. The University of Akron won the Division I NCAA men's soccer title in 2010, was a finalist in 2018, and has reached the College Cup final four six times.\n\nThe Zips have sent many players to MLS, including Crew midfielder Darlington Nagbe.\n\nCleveland was in the running for an NWSL expansion team. After those efforts fell short, a local group this week announced its plans to field a club in WPSL Pro, a Division II and feeder league for NWSL.\n\nHuntington Bank Field has hosted U.S. men's and women's national team matches, including two Concacaf Gold Cup doubleheaders.\n\nColumbus is one of the original members of Major League Soccer but has found itself in competition with fans in Ohio since FC Cincinnati began play in 2016 and joined MLS three years later.\n\n\"We think it's got a real half-life with the Crew in Columbus. If we can do this right, we can create new fans in Cleveland,\" Glessing said. \"We hope that these people are going to travel to Columbus in the future to engage with the Crew there because they've been exposed to something new for the first time.\"\n\nBesides Messi's fanfare, it is a matchup between MLS's only two unbeaten teams. The Crew (5-0-3) lead the Eastern Conference with 18 points while Inter Miami (4-0-3) has played one fewer match and sits in fourth place with 15 points.\n\nMessi has three goals and two assists in four MLS matches this season. Crew midfielder Sean Zawadzki, who grew up in Olmsted Falls, is excited for the opportunity to play in front of hometown fans.\n\n\"To me, it means a lot,\" Zawadzki said. \"It's a place I've grown up going to, supporting the Browns and other teams in Cleveland. So to be there, closer to family and friends, obviously is a big part for me. So I'm just really looking forward to the game.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press and ESPN's Lizzy Becherano was used in this report."

Forgive any insanity here within.\n\nSo, the Cubs had an early lead that they built into a large lead in the later innings, primarily on the strength of an Ian Happ grand slam. But then they lost that large lead, primarily on the strength of a Eugenio Suarez grand slam. (Painfully predictable, as Suarez has obliterated the Cubs for his career, and is ONLY hitting against the Cubs so far this season.) Then things got worse, as the Diamondbacks took the lead and tacked on. Suddenly they were the team with the healthy-sized lead.\n\nBut then the Cubs IMMEDIATELY came back, putting up a monster inning of their own, with homers from Carson Kelly, Kyle Tucker, and Seiya Suzuki. My head was spinning like a DBacks outfielder.\n\nI kinda can’t believe the Cubs held on from there to win it.\n\nThe Ankin Law “Making it Personal” Player of the Game could go to a number of guys, from Carson Kelly and his two dingers to Ian Happ and his granny to Kyle Tucker and the homer that proved to be the game-winner. Of course, given how high-scoring this thing got, you could argue that a pitcher who went almost five innings and allowed just one run deserves the award!\n\nColin Rea was mostly fantastic today, executing pitches at a level you wouldn’t normally associate with Rea. Good velocity, crisp movement, good location. He hit a bit of a wall there in the 5th as the lineup turned over to the third time through, but that’ll happen sometimes (and really, it was only two hits). But on the whole, it was the second straight outing from Rea that you watch and think … should this guy stay in the rotation no matter what? Really impressive work, especially against a Diamondbacks lineup that FEASTS on righties.\n\nAlthough folks might say “the bullpen” was bad again today, there were actually several excellent performances, and really just two WTF performances. One of those, from Jordan Wicks, featured two ground-ball singles, which, you know, sometimes whatever. The other, from Porter Hodge, was the real ugly one. Gonna have to go back and watch again to see what was happening.\n\nFor now, though, I’m just gonna MARVEL at that win. Wow. How did they do that?\n\nFull box score."

Do the Leafs still have the edge over the Sens? Ottawa has owned the regular-season series versus Toronto over the past two seasons, after all.\n\nThe Leafs are barely favored to advance to the second round for just the second time in the Auston Matthews era, with four of seven editors picking Ontario's capital over Canada's capital. What is unanimous is that this series is going deep, as five have the matchup going the distance to seven games.\n\nIcon Sportswire / Icon Sportswire / Getty\n\nThe two Florida teams have combined to win the Eastern Conference for the past five seasons. The stakes are high as the Lightning look to make the second round for the first time since reaching the Stanley Cup Final in 2022, while the Panthers eye a third consecutive Final appearance.\n\nThe margins are razor-thin. Tampa Bay is a slight favorite over the defending Cup champs, with four editors picking the Lightning, and the series is expected to go deep. This one's gonna be a bloodbath and a must-see matchup.\n\nPatrick Smith / Getty Images Sport / Getty\n\nFifteen years ago, a punchy eighth-seeded Montreal Canadiens shocked the Presidents' Trophy-winning Washington Capitals en route to the conference finals. Can they do it again? Most say no, but it wasn't unanimous. One editor believes the Habs can find that postseason magic for another big upset.\n\nRich Graessle / National Hockey League / Getty\n\nA healthy Jack Hughes would significantly change the outlook of this series, but that's not the world we live in. The Devils are banged up, and the Hurricanes consistently win at least one round in the postseason. Carolina isn't a division winner, but it's easily the biggest favorite in the East among the editors.\n\nJonathan Kozub / National Hockey League / Getty\n\nThe Jets are a near-unanimous pick, though it won't be an easy series. Everyone has the series going at least six games, with one editor picking the Presidents' Trophy winners to bow out in Round 1. Dylan Holloway and Nikolaj Ehlers are two key players on the shelf who could have big impacts if they return during the first round.\n\nJordan Binnington got the last laugh at the 4 Nations Face-Off, but it might be Connor Hellebuyck's time for revenge.\n\nMichael Martin / National Hockey League / Getty\n\nInjuries might dampen what was shaping up to be an all-time first-round battle. Miro Heiskanen isn't expected to be ready for the start of the series, and Jason Robertson was hurt in Dallas' last game of the regular season. If both are out for the Stars, it could be a difficult path to victory against an Avalanche squad that, against all odds, appears to be getting captain Gabriel Landeskog back.\n\nIcon Sportswire / Icon Sportswire / Getty\n\nThis might be the most lopsided first-round matchup, with two editors picking the Golden Knights to sweep the Wild and everyone picking Vegas to advance. Minnesota has struggled down the stretch and needed a last-minute Joel Eriksson Ek goal against the Anaheim Ducks just to clinch a playoff spot. A Wild series victory against a Golden Knights team that's in prime position for another Cup run would be a stunner.\n\nCodie McLachlan / Getty Images Sport / Getty\n\nIs it finally time for the Kings to knock off the Oilers? In a mild surprise, six of seven editors have Los Angeles advancing past the defending Western Conference champs. It's bold to pick against Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, but there are many reasons to favor the Kings in this one.\n\nDarcy Kuemper could be a finalist for the Vezina Trophy, while Stuart Skinner has had a rocky campaign. Edmonton's best defensive defenseman, Mattias Ekholm, is out with an injury. The Oilers have brushed aside L.A. for three years in a row. That run is in serious jeopardy.\n\nIcon Sportswire / Icon Sportswire / Getty\n\nSix of seven editors believe a Florida team will win the Eastern Conference for the sixth consecutive season. Which one it will be is split right down the middle, with three picks for each of the Panthers and Lightning.\n\nThe Hurricanes are heavily favored to come out of the Metropolitan side of the bracket, with Carolina representing the division for six of seven editors. Only one has the Canes finally breaking through to make the Cup Final, however.\n\nTyler McFarland/Clarkson Creative / Getty Images Sport / Getty\n\nNo editors have the defending Western-winning Oilers even getting back to the conference final, with only one editor picking Edmonton to make it out of Round 1.\n\nThe Golden Knights are a favorite to make it to the final four and represent the Pacific Division, though the Central teams are the preferred pick to make the Cup Final. The Avalanche are the most common pick to win the West, with the Jets and Stars also being backed for a deep run.\n\nMatthew Stockman / Getty Images Sport / Getty\n\nIt's the West's world, and we're just living in it. Every editor picked a Western Conference winner to also go on to win the Stanley Cup.\n\nColorado, the preferred selection, and Vegas would claim their second titles with their current core players. The Stars haven't won since 1999 and have lost in the final twice since their triumph, most recently in 2020. And of course, the Winnipeg Jets have never claimed Lord Stanley's mug, neither in its original iteration nor in the Atlanta Thrashers/current Jets franchise history.\n\nAshley Potts / National Hockey League / Getty\n\nA year after winning his first Hart Trophy, MacKinnon is the marginal favorite to win the Conn Smythe among the editors. A Makar win would be a historic second playoff MVP for the star defenseman, as only Bobby Orr has accomplished the feat among NHL rearguards.\n\nEichel and Stone also get some love for the Golden Knights, while Johnston is favored for a postseason run that would elevate him into a top star in the game. A Conn Smythe win for Hellebuyck would put his season among the greatest by a goaltender, especially in the modern era."

            "content": "BOSTON (AP) — The Boston Marathon and Mayor Michelle Wu insisted on Friday that international runners and other foreign visitors remain welcome in the city and said there is no evidence that travel for this year’s race has fallen off in the face of increased border scrutiny.\n\n“Regardless of what’s happening at other levels, and particularly now at the federal level, in Boston we welcome everyone,” Wu said at a public safety media briefing not far from the finish line. “We seek to be a home for everyone.”\n\nA cherished event for runners and spectators alike, staged on the state holiday of Patriots’ Day commemorating the battles of Lexington and Concord that sparked the American Revolution 250 years ago, the Boston Marathon is the world’s oldest and most prestigious annual 26.2-mile race.\n\nIt has taken on even greater significance — and popularity — since 2013, when two pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line, killing three people and wounding hundreds more. (Allen Davis, the assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston office, said at the briefing that there were “no credible or specific threats” to Monday’s race.)\n\nThis year’s marathon has more than 30,000 entrants from 128 countries. Boston Athletic Association President Jack Fleming said the 129th edition of the race was full — thousands more are turned away — and there’s been no indication that those registered are staying home.\n\n“We have a lot of demand this year, as we do every year,” he said.\n\nBut as U.S. officials track plummeting tourism numbers, with many would-be visitors angered by President Donald Trumps’ tariffs and rhetoric and alarmed by stories about tourists being arrested at the border, reports say at least some potential marathon attendees have decided to skip the race.\n\nCanadians have been especially put off by Trump’s talk of making the country the 51st U.S. state. Paula Roberts-Banks, a writer and photographer from Rosseau, Ontario, who has run Boston 12 times, wrote in Canadian Running magazine that she earned a coveted bib for this year’s race but decided not to run because she has “soured” on the U.S.\n\n“I simply don’t want to go there,” she said. “It feels like a breakup.”\n\nBritish runner Calli Hauger-Thackery, a 2024 Olympian who is entered in the women’s professional field, said she has never experienced a problem coming to the U.S. but she worries now that that might change.\n\n“It does scare me traveling a little bit, at the moment,” she said, adding that she is married to an American and has a visa. “I hope it’s enough for them to not flag me or anything coming in and out of the States.”\n\nMost of the 31,941 entrants in Monday’s race were required to qualify at another marathon, and many of them view running Boston as a lifelong athletic goal. Still, about 10% of the field typically does not toe the starting line in Hopkinton for reasons that range from injuries to weather to the 2010 eruption of a volcano in Iceland that halted flights and prevented hundreds of Europeans from traveling to Boston.\n\nIn last year’s field of 29,333 entrants, there were 2,838 who failed to start. Race officials say they will not know how many no-shows there are this year until Monday; even then, they won’t know why.\n\n“We do not have data as to why people may or may not be coming to Boston,” Fleming said. “At the BAA, our goal is to create a marathon experience that is very welcoming and joyous. Every year, we focus on that goal and we are confident that we have done everything in our power to achieve that this year.”\n\nWu said she hoped visitors would look past the geopolitical climate and “participate in this very, very important global tradition that should transcend politics and should transcend the issues of the day.”\n\nAnd that’s just what Australian Patrick Tiernan plans to do.\n\n“There are some unfortunate situations going on in the U.S. right now, but I don’t think that should have to taint what’s happening here, and the history of this race,” said the two-time Olympian, who was an NCAA cross country champion at Villanova. “I think everybody’s very excited to be here and excited to compete on Monday.”\n\n___\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports"

With a score of 324.894, Nebraska punched its ticket to compete for the NCAA trophy. Oklahoma came in second with a 323.460 and Penn State rounded out the qualifiers for 321.992. Asher Cohen nabbed the first spot on still rings with a 14.20. Yanni Chronopoulos took third, and Chris Hiser took the fourth spot on rings.

Hiser completed the rotation, completing a fourth-place routine with a 13.933. Hiser’s score gave Nebraska a team score of 54.598 and the push to the third place spot at 267.728 overall headed into the final rotation.\n\nSixth Rotation - Vault\n\nJames vaulted first, tying his career high of 14.20 for a fourth-place finish.

That’s why it was such a big deal on Thursday when Rodgers joined The Pat McAfee Show, speaking about his free agency situation for the first time since the new league year began. Friday, Steelers insider Gerry Dulac joined The Rich Eisen Show and spoke about the contract offer the Steelers have on the table for Rodgers.\n\n“Their offer hasn’t changed,” Dulac said. “It’s been on the table. It’s a one-year deal. I can’t tell you exactly what the number is, but it’s not anything that’s gonna blow somebody away. They’re basically waiting for him to make the decision. And they’re willing to wait. But anything he said yesterday was not any surprise to the Steelers.”\n\n💻 @gerrydulac While the @steelers continue their waiting for Aaron Rodgers — what is their plan at QB for the coming years?#NFL #NFLDraft #HereWeGo pic.twitter.com/R86Df34I6Y — Rich Eisen Show (@RichEisenShow) April 18, 2025\n\nMoney doesn’t seem to be an issue for Rodgers. He’s earned a ton of it throughout his career, as a player who’s won four NFL MVP awards. Rodgers even stated as much during his interview yesterday, saying he would play for $10 million.\n\nThat amount feels reasonable for Rodgers. He didn’t have a bad year in 2024, but compared to the rest of his career, it does rank as one of his worst statistical seasons. That and the fact that he’s going to turn 42 during the 2025 season makes it easy to see why a team wouldn’t want to make a big financial commitment to him.\n\nRight now, the Steelers seem like the only team ready to make any sort of commitment to him. There have been rumors regarding Rodgers and the Minnesota Vikings throughout the offseason. Rodgers mentioned those during his interview, but nothing he said pointed toward him signing with them this offseason. However, he did speak favorably of his meeting with the Steelers, as well as his workout with their new star receiver, DK Metcalf.\n\nThe Steelers had a cheap quarterback room last year. Based on Dulac’s comments, as well as Rodgers’ on Thursday, it seems like they’re following the same plan of action. Rodgers would be another cheap veteran signing, and the Steelers hope it will work out better this year than it did with Russell Wilson if it happens."

            "content": "CORVALLIS — Gavin Turley has been sitting on the doorstep of Oregon State baseball history for weeks. But, really, it’s been in the back of his mind for years.\n\nWhen he was 7 years old, Turley would slip on his pint-sized little league uniform before sunrise, sidle into his parent’s bedroom and poke his father.\n\n“Let’s go hit!” he’d say, jostling Jason Turley awake at 4:45 a.m.\n\nLater that year, while playing two levels up against 9-year olds, Turley stepped to the plate with a playoff spot on the line, pointed toward the outfield fence — calling his shot like Babe Ruth — and hit a walk-off homer to win the game. Turley went on to set the Arizona high school single-season home run record and become the highest-ranked prep recruit to arrive at Oregon State.\n\nBy the time he landed in Corvallis, Turley instantly lived up to the hype, belting home runs in his first college at-bat and his first Goss Stadium at-bat.\n\nSo when he blasted a pair of homers Thursday night at Cal State Northridge, giving him 44 for his career and nudging him to within one of the Beavers’ all-time record of 45, it wasn’t so much a surprise as it was a coronation. The moment he stepped foot on campus, Turley seemed destined to become Oregon State’s Home Run King.\n\n“I’ve hit home runs since a young age,” Turley said. “So, yeah, it’s always kind of been in the back of my mind. It’s always been a huge goal.”\n\nThe goal moved from back of mind to the forefront last year, when Turley watched Travis Bazzana hit 28 during a ridiculous, record-setting season. While fans and Major League Baseball scouts marveled at the supernatural talent and theatrics of the future No. 1 overall MLB draft pick, Turley scrutinized his teammate’s approach to hitting and the way he prepared for baseball’s mental and physical grind. It was reasoned, mostly emotionless, and laser-focused on day-to-day development.\n\n“Watching that kid every day was a huge part of my career and how I’ve gone about my work,” Turley said. “Because it’s very analytical, very non-emotional. And I think when you keep it that way, you can make adjustments on the fly. He did that very well, and I took note of that.”\n\nHe also took note of Bazzana’s final home run totals and figuratively shrugged. Turley hit 33 during his first two college seasons, including 19 in Bazzana’s shadow last season. That left Turley just 12 shy of the record, well within his reach.\n\n“As soon as Bazz set the record last year,” Turley said, “I was like, ‘Oh! Well, I’m not far behind.’ I knew I was in range to beat it.”\n\n2025 chase start slowly\n\nBut Turley’s home run chase did not flourish immediately this season. After eight games, he boasted just one homer. After 23 games, he only had three.\n\nTurley is no stranger to slumps — he fought through a nightmare skid as a freshman — but this drought wasn’t entirely unexpected. It came, in part, because Turley had debuted a new hitting approach, which was focused on using all parts of the field. During his first two seasons, Turley tried to yank every pitch — no matter where it crossed the plate — to the left side. It hurt his batting average and contact rate, boosted his strikeout rate, and made him a predictable hitter.\n\nIt was all-too-common to see Turley chase breaking balls in the dirt and whiff. And when he did take the ball the other way, it usually resulted in soft contact and easy outs.\n\nDuring an exit interview following the 2024 season, coach Mitch Canham and his staff showed Turley his full-season analytics report, and the results were startling.\n\n“I knew that I hardly used the right side of the field,” Turley said. “But the analytics report really made it apparent. Down the right field line, I was slugging, like, .091. In the right-center center gap, I was slugging .250. And then everyone else on the left side, I was slugging, like, 1.400. So I remember that really stood out. I was just pull-hooking, pull-yanking the ball almost every single swing.”\n\nOregon State's Gavin Turley (1), Aiva Arquette (middle) and AJ Singer celebrate Turley's three-run home run in the Beavers' 6-0 win over the Indiana Hoosiers Sunday in Surprise, Arizona. (Photo by Jerry Espinoza/Oregon State athletics)Jerry Espinoza/Oregon State athletics\n\nTurley arrived in Corvallis with two goals: To carry the Beavers to another national championship and to take another step toward becoming a Major Leaguer. Well, the message from the coaches was clear — if he wanted to achieve those goals, he needed to evolve.\n\n“It’s just sharing what we know, what opponents know, and what it’s going to take if he wants to play a long time in the Big Leagues,” Canham said. “I don’t like hiding anything from the guys.”\n\nSo Turley dedicated his offseason to refining his approach. He made a slight adjustment to his swing mechanics, focusing on keeping his frontside back and preventing his hands from releasing too early. But most of the work came between his ears.\n\n“I think the swing’s always been there,” he said. “It’s more of a trust thing within my swing to hit it behind the ball and put my eyes behind the ball.”\n\nHe tested his new approach during the Cape Cod Summer League and saw gradual improvement, then stuck with his process in the fall. When the Beavers played a double-header against Gonzaga in Bend in October, Turley used his pregame batting practice to flaunt his evolution.\n\nIt didn’t matter that a horde of scouts were in the stands and most players were looking for inside fastballs to put on a show. Turley wanted pitches that would show off his growth.\n\n“Everyone’s there, including all the scouts, and most guys are like, ‘Throw me middle-in so I can hit homers,’” Canham said. “But Gav goes, ‘Hey, throw me middle-away.’ And he’s hitting oppo bombs. Low liners. Hard-hit grounders. More oppo bombs. That’s maturity right there. Especially when there’s a whole bunch of scouts. And it was that way on the first day of competition in the fall.”\n\nAdded Turley: “Every scout in the country knows that I can hit the ball pull-side 450 feet whenever I want. I’ve proven that. Now it’s about showing them that I am a complete hitter, that I can go the other way, that I have a swing that can do that and I can see the ball a little bit deeper. The thought process was: ‘Hey, what am I lacking? Let’s make that a strength.’”\n\nA complete package\n\nAnd it has, most certainly, evolved into a strength.\n\nForty-seven percent of Turley’s hits this season have soared to right or right-center field, including 46% of his home runs. Heading into April, Turley boasted an on-base percentage of 1.410 on balls hit to the right side. And when the sixth-ranked Beavers slugged a school-record eight home runs in a win at Nebraska last month, Turley blasted three, equaling the OSU single-game record.\n\nTwo of them were hit to center and one was hit to right.\n\n“I think it’s about time he (hits a) pull-side home run,” OSU second baseman AJ Singer said, joking, after the Nebraska series. “He’s been working oppo all year. He’s showing off, basically.”\n\nReally, Turley has been showing off all season. The 6-foot-1 junior outfielder enters Friday night’s game at Cal State Northridge hitting .356 with 11 homers, six doubles, 41 RBIs and 25 walks. He leads the team in batting average, hits and homers, and is second in RBIs. And Turley’s strikeout rate, which has always drawn criticism, has dipped from 32.8% to 28.3% to 21.0% over the last three years.\n\nWhen’s the last time you saw him flail at an unhittable breaking ball in the dirt? The kid who arrived into Corvallis with raw power has transformed himself into a professional-looking hitter.\n\n“His raw power and bat speed is unmatched, especially from his frame,” Canham said. “I’ve never been around guys that can do what he does with his frame. The way that Gav can get the barrel going … he’s extremely physical and fit and he can really get it moving. He’s going to be a big leaguer one day, no doubt.”\n\nBut that will have to wait. In the here and now, Turley has a championship to chase and a home run record to topple.\n\nSince that early-season home run drought, he has blasted eight in the last 12 games, inching closer to Oregon State history. And while it’s something Turley long ago aspired to achieve, he’s had trouble wrapping his head around the idea that it’s almost a reality.\n\nTurley fell in love with Corvallis when he visited as a teenager and he’s long expressed his affinity for the program and its stroried tradition.\n\nAs he tried to describe earlier this month what it would mean to become OSU’s Home Run King, Turley couldn’t help but get choked up as he stammered his way through three years of thoughts and feelings.\n\n“It’s really hard to put into word without getting emotional,” he said. “It’s something that’s always been there since my freshman year, like, my pace or whatever. But, most importantly, my mindset is that I have to be OK with where I’m at today. It’s very, very hard to balance everything, for sure, but just being in the position to even be the No. 2 record holder at Oregon State is a ginormous blessing and success in itself. So if I beat it, I beat it. If I don’t, I’m still beyond happy with where I’m at and what I’ve been able to do so far.\n\n“It’s been an absolute dream. I always try to leave a legacy wherever I go and the record would definitely be a part of my legacy.”\n\n— Joe Freeman | jfreeman@oregonian.com | 503-294-5183 | @BlazerFreeman | @freemanjoe.bsky.social | Subscribe to The Oregonian/OregonLive newsletters and podcasts for the latest news and top stories."

            "description": "Wants another postseason chance with Malkin, Letang, 'we've got to find a way to get back there'",
            "content": "CRANBERRY, Pa. -- Sidney Crosby walked into an empty locker room Friday.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins captain came to grab some things, say a few goodbyes and head into another long offseason.\n\nA few years ago, it would have been an odd scene. Missing the Stanley Cup Playoffs rarely was considered during a streak of 16 straight appearances from 2007-22.\n\nNow, the Penguins will sit out a third straight postseason. Crosby wants it to end.\n\n\"It's difficult when you're cleaning out your locker and stall and you're just thinking [about] how fun it is to play in the playoffs,\" Crosby said. \"How important that is and how much work everyone puts into trying to make that happen. It's not a fun feeling when other teams are playing and you're going home.\"\n\nAt age 37, Crosby continues to do his part, leading Pittsburgh with 91 points (33 goals, 58 assists) in 80 games. He averaged at least 1.00 points per game for a 20th season, passing Wayne Gretzky (19) for the most in NHL history, and reached 90 points in a third straight season for the first time.\n\nBut there's urgency.\n\nThe Penguins haven't won a postseason series since 2018. Crosby, who will turn 38 on Aug. 7, is the youngest of a core trio including center Evgeni Malkin and defenseman Kris Letang.\n\nMalkin will be 39 years old on July 31 and will be going into the final season of a four-year, $24.4 million contract ($6.1 million average annual value) signed July 12, 2022. He had 50 points (16 goals, 34 assists) in 68 games.\n\nLetang will turn 38 on April 24. He had surgery this week to close a small hole in the wall of his heart and finished the season with 30 points (nine goals, 21 assists) in 74 games, his lowest total since 2013-14 when he had 22 points (11 goals, 11 assists) in 37 games.\n\nCrosby, Malkin and Letang have won the Stanley Cup three times (2009, 2016, 2017).\n\nThey've pushed for a fourth. Time won't stop. At some point, they won't be around.\n\n\"Missing the playoffs the last few years, I think there's always going to be thoughts and opinions,\" Crosby said. \"We've got to prove it. I think that we've got to find a way to get back there. ... When you lose, you're going to hear that. That's part of it. That's part of what [stings] about losing. But yeah, it's up to us to find a way to get back there.\"\n\nCrosby knows how it feels to lift the Cup. Erik Karlsson hasn't gotten to that point yet.\n\nThe 34-year-old defenseman was acquired from the San Jose Sharks in a three-team trade involving the Montreal Canadiens on Aug. 6, 2023. At the time, he said Pittsburgh provided his best chance of winning the Stanley Cup for the first time.\n\nIn two seasons, Karlsson has led Penguins defensemen with 109 points (22 goals, 87 assists) in 164 games but has missed the playoffs twice. His desire for a championship hasn't changed.\n\n\"It's still at the same level,\" Karlsson said. “Obviously I love being here and I've enjoyed my time here on a personal level. There's zero complaints, obviously.\"\n\nKarlsson, who has two seasons left on an eight-year, $92 million contract ($11.5 million AAV), would like to remain in Pittsburgh. He also knows it might not be his decision.\n\n\"I've been in this situation before and been through this before,\" Karlsson said. \"I realize the magnitude of it. At the end of the day, it's a business. Whatever happens is going to happen. But all I can say is I've enjoyed everything here. I enjoy [it] on a personal level. Me and my family really want it to work here.\"\n\nChange has been constant since Kyle Dubas was hired as general manager and president of hockey operations June 1, 2023.\n\nThe prospect pool was retooled. Rutger McGroarty, acquired in a trade from the Winnipeg Jets on Aug. 22, and Ville Koivunen, acquired in a trade that sent Jake Guentzel to the Carolina Hurricanes on March 7, 2024, provided evidence after the rookie forwards were recalled from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League on March 28.\n\nIn the next three years at the NHL Draft, Pittsburgh has 30 picks, including four in the first round and 18 in the first three.\n\n\"The opportunity to leverage those prospects and draft capital that [Dubas has] acquired to potentially help our team in the near future is a real possibility,\" coach Mike Sullivan said. \"So I know that those are Kyle's intentions. Obviously, would we like to return this team to contention when that window still exists, when we still have, in particular, our captain that's still playing at such an elite level? I know those are Kyle's intentions. They're certainly his aspirations.\"\n\nSullivan plans to oversee it in what would be his 11th season with Pittsburgh.\n\n\"My intentions are to be the head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins,\" he said.\n\nIn some ways, next season should look familiar. Sullivan was hired Dec. 12, 2015. Crosby was a rookie in 2005-06 before Malkin and Letang joined the following season.\n\n\"I guess it is on the back of your mind that these guys who have been here, and they carry the torch, that time is undefeated,\" said forward Bryan Rust, who had an NHL career-high 31 goals in his 11th season. \"I think all good things come to an end. But don't think we're quite there yet. So we've got time, and obviously we want to make the most of it, especially with these franchise guys who have been here for so long.\"\n\nEven they can't rest though. Not with the intention of being part of that next run.\n\n\"You know what? Regardless of your age, you have to prove yourself,\" Crosby said. \"If there's a lot of healthy competition, I think that's better for us. That means that there's tough decisions that have to be made. So if you have a good team, I think that's what you're looking at.\""

            "description": "The first round of the 2025 NBA playoffs gets started on Saturday",
            "content": "The NBA has a bit of a reputation for chalky playoffs. Recent history suggests otherwise. It was only two years ago, for instance, the second round featured one team holding every seed between No. 1 and No. 8. Last year's conference finals featured only one top-two seed. This is the NBA's parity era. That means condensed standings in the regular season and upsets in the playoffs.\n\nIt's our job now to figure out where those upsets are going to come. Now that (most) first-round matchups are set, the CBS Sports NBA staff went matchup-by-matchup to make our picks to advance to the final eight. Some of these matchups are pretty straightforward. You'll be shocked to hear that we expect the defending champion Boston Celtics to advance against the Orlando Magic. Others, especially in the packed middle of the standings, are far more complicated.\n\nBelow are our staff picks for the first round. Some of us will look brilliant. Others, foolish. If recent NBA history is any indication, expect a bit more of the latter than the former. While there are a few juggernauts at the top of the bracket, it's anyone's guess as to who will emerge as their greatest threats as the playoffs progress.\n\nNo. 1 Cleveland Cavaliers vs. No. 8 Miami Heat\n\nSeries odds: Celtics -8000, Magic +2200 (via FanDuel)\n\n\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Cavaliers vs. Heat Cavaliers Cavaliers Cavaliers Cavaliers Cavaliers Cavaliers\n\nBotkin: Cavs in 4. Don't even think about doing some crazy, Miami. Be happy with your historic 10th seed to 8th seed climb. Jimmy Butler ain't walking through that door. He has real business to attend to in the Bay. Cavs roll.\n\nHerbert: Cavaliers in 4. Shoutout to Miami for becoming the first team to finish 10th in its conference and make the playoffs. Unfortunately, it now has to deal with Cleveland, an opponent that has much more firepower (and the fifth-best halfcourt defense in the league, per Cleaning The Glass).\n\nMaloney: Cavs in 5. The Heat making the playoffs out of the No. 10 spot was impressive, and they've only been swept once since Erik Spoelstra took over in 2008. They'll figure out a way to get one game, but not any more than that against a Cavs team that cruised to the No. 1 seed.\n\nQuinn: Cavaliers in 5. Erik Spoelstra has coached in 33 playoff series. He's only been swept once. He gets enough respect to win a game here, but this is a mismatch. The Jimmy Butler-less Heat aren't the playoff spoiler they've been in the past. They should be little more than a warm-up for the No. 1 seed.\n\nWard-Henninger: Cavaliers in 5. You always hesitate to pick against Miami, but this isn't the postseason-nightmare Heat we're used to seeing now that Jimmy Butler is in Golden State. That being said, they'll still be a tough out, but Cleveland just has weapons upon weapons upon weapons on both ends of the floor to wear down an inferior opponent.\n\nWimbish: Cavaliers in 4. The Heat put together two impressive performances in the play-in to get here. But the Cavaliers are a different animal entirely. Cleveland has depth, is going to make life difficult for Tyler Herro and can look to several guys to get them points. Miami's lack of depth is going to stand out in this series.\n\nNo. 2 Boston Celtics vs. No. 7 Orlando Magic\n\nSeries odds: Celtics -8000, Magic +2200\n\n\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Celtics vs. Magic Celtics Celtics Celtics Celtics Celtics Celtics\n\nBotkin: Celtics in 5. Sweeps are hard in the NBA, and the Magic may make a couple of these games close with their defense and a random decent offensive showing. But this is a mismatch. Celtics cruise.\n\nHerbert: Celtics in 4. The Celtics dropped one game in the first round against the Heat last year. They dropped two the year before against the Hawks. It's time, I think, for them to start the playoffs by just stomping on somebody. (Also, the Magic are going to have an incredibly tough time scoring against Boston.)\n\nMaloney: Celtics in 4. The Magic have the worst offensive rating (108.9) of any playoff team, and simply do not have the firepower to post a serious threat to the defending champions.\n\nQuinn: Celtics in 5. The Magic defend the 3-point line well enough to steal a game, but without Jalen Suggs, they pose no threat whatsoever to the defending champs.\n\nWard-Henninger: Celtics in 4. Even if the Celtics have one anomalously poor shooting night, the Magic simply can't score enough to keep up with them. With multiple physical defenders to throw at Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero throughout the series, Orlando's poor offense might be even more destitute. I'd like to think the Magic could steal a game, but that's probably not very realistic.\n\nWimbish: Celtics in 4. Orlando just doesn't have enough shooting. The Magic win with their defense, we saw that as they suffocated a shorthanded Hawks team in the play-in. But against a team that averages 48.2 3-point attempts a game, it's going to be difficult to keep up with that.\n\nSeries odds: Knicks -420, Pistons +330\n\n\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Knicks vs. Pistons Knicks Knicks Knicks Knicks Knicks Knicks\n\nBotkin: Knicks in 7. Detroit is going to make life hell for the Knicks. This is more than a nice story; this team defends like crazy and Cade Cunningham is impossible to keep out of the paint. But the Knicks have more reliable secondary offensive options, and I think that wins it for them in a very tight series.\n\nHerbert: Knicks in 6. Cade Cunningham has given New York (and everybody else) problems this season. He's going to target Karl-Anthony Towns in pick-and-rolls, and, in that situation, I don't love any of the coverages the Knicks can choose from. On the other hand, the Pistons are (mostly) inexperienced, and I don't trust them to defend an elite offense like this without fouling. They have less high-end talent, too.\n\nMaloney: Knicks in 6. This could be a trendy upset pick for some, but as well as the Pistons have played in the second half of the season, the fact of the matter is they don't have as many good players as the Knicks, or as much experience.\n\nQuinn: Knicks in 7. This is a sneakily dangerous series for the Knicks. Ausar Thompson is going to make life miserable for Jalen Brunson. In the end, though, there are just too many Pistons the Knicks can help off defensively, so Detroit will struggle to score enough to win.\n\nWard-Henninger: Knicks in 6. The Pistons are a great story, but I just trust the Knicks' experience -- particularly that of Jalen Brunson -- over a team led by a talented point guard in his first postseason. One of Cade Cunningham's few flaws is that he's a little loose with the ball, and the Knicks have the defensive strength, length and speed to make his life hell for the entire series.\n\nWimbish: Knicks in 6. Make no mistake, the Knicks shouldn't take Detroit lightly. This isn't the team from a season ago that set an NBA losing-streak record. But I'm leaning on the experience and craftiness of Jalen Brunson, and Karl-Anthony Towns to overpower a young Pistons team that is likely a year or two away from serious contention.\n\nSeries odds: Pacers -176, Bucks +148\n\n\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Pacers vs. Bucks Pacers Pacers Pacers Pacers Pacers Pacers\n\nBotkin: Pacers in 6. Great news that Damian Lillard has been cleared to return. But he's still out for Game 1 and nobody knows when, exactly, he'll return, or whether he'll be able to just hit the ground running at full speed, so to speak. Giannis is enough to make this a competitive series if the Bucks are making a fair amount of their 3s, but in the end, it's been the Pacers who've been one of the best teams in the league for the last three-plus months. With or without Lillard, the Bucks lose this series. They'll just make it a little closer with him.\n\nHerbert: Pacers in 6. With or without Damian Lillard, Milwaukee doesn't have the personnel to slow Indiana down. I'm more confident in Indiana's role players than Milwaukee's, and I'm not sure what to expect of Lillard after more than a month off. This pick makes me a bit nervous because I can envision Giannis Antetokounmpo repeatedly getting the Indiana bigs in foul trouble, but I can also envision the Pacers' speed wearing down Milwaukee over the course of the series.\n\nMaloney: Pacers in 7. Damian Lillard's impending return makes this series far more interesting, but he's going to miss at least Game 1 and it's still unclear when he'll be back on the court. And as well as Giannis Antetokounmpo has been playing lately, it's just too hard to trust the Bucks' supporting cast in a playoff setting.\n\nQuinn: Pacers in 6. Milwaukee is just at too much of a talent disadvantage to compensate here with Damian Lillard out for at least Game 1. But even if the Bucks get him back mid-series, he just gives Indiana's offense a target to attack on other end. The Pacers have been great for three solid months now and should advance to the second round.\n\nWard-Henninger: Pacers in 7. It's hard to predict this series not knowing how much -- if anything -- the Bucks will get from Damian Lillard, but even without him the Pacers, like most teams, simply have no answer for Giannis Antetokounmpo. Ultimately Indiana just has more weapons than Milwaukee if Dame is even moderately compromised, and I trust them in a Game 7 at home with Tyrese Haliburton at the helm.\n\nWimbish: Pacers in 7. Without Damian Lillard -- at least to start the series -- this is going to be a tall task for Milwaukee. The Pacers are entering this series with the eighth-best defense since the All-Star break, and Tyrese Haliburton is looking like the All-Star version of himself from last season. That being said, I don't see a world where Giannis Antetokounmpo doesn't try and push this to a seven-game series.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo won't be distracted by testy Bucks-Pacers history, explains why even losing is 'win-win' Colin Ward-Henninger\n\nNo. 1 Thunder vs. No. 8 Grizzlies\n\nSeries odds: Thunder -4000, Grizzlies: +1500\n\n\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Thunder vs. Grizzlies Thunder Thunder Thunder Thunder Thunder Thunder\n\nBotkin: Thunder in 5: The Grizzlies are a very good and dangerous team, even if we've spun that fact inside our \"they're in disarray!\" news cycle, and they are going to play this series with the pedal to the floor. But we're also not giving nearly enough credit to the gap between OKC and the rest of the West. Someone is going to have to pull off a major upset to beat the Thunder. It won't be Memphis.\n\nHerbert: Thunder in 4. Oklahoma City had little trouble with this matchup in the regular season, and Memphis is far from full strength now. The Grizzlies may challenge the Thunder's transition defense and interior defense (both of which have been elite), but I expect OKC to pass those tests.\n\nMaloney: Thunder in 4. The Grizzlies were already short-handed and now Ja Morant is going to be less than 100% due a sprained ankle. It's hard to see how they pose any threat to a Thunder team that just completed one of the best regular seasons ever.\n\nQuinn: Thunder in 4. Friday's play-in win had more to do with the Mavericks than the Grizzlies. Memphis is still depleted with Jaylen Wells and Brandon Clarke hurt. The Thunder are healthy and just had one of the greatest regular seasons in NBA history. This one's a no-brainer.\n\nWard-Henninger: Thunder in 5. The Grizzlies have shown some grit to bounce back from what looked like a disastrous conclusion to the regular season, but they're running into an absolute buzzsaw in OKC. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is poised to carve up Memphis' porous defense, while the Thunder's endless cadre of bulky wings will be a horror for Ja Morant. Give them one in Memphis, but that's about it.\n\nWimbish: Thunder in 4. Memphis beat a dysfunctional Mavericks team that probably shouldn't have even been in the play-in at all. It was a great performance from Ja Morant who is dealing with an ankle injury, but not having Jaylen Wells and Brandon Clarke is going to really hurt the Grizzlies against a Thunder team that is fresh off a historical regular season.\n\nNo. 2 Rockets vs. No. 7 Warriors\n\nSeries odds: Rockets +138, Warriors -166\n\n\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Warriors vs. Rockets Warriors Warriors Warriors Warriors Warriors Warriors\n\nBotkin: Warriors in 7. Forget about the Rockets being \"young\" -- this is a nasty team in all the right ways. They are way more athletic than the Warriors and defensively armed to make Stephen Curry's life miserable at least for long stretches, if not entire games. Point will not come easily for the Warriors, but ultimately, they have two guys in Curry and Jimmy Butler who can create offense out of nothing for the handful of possessions that I believe will swing this series. Disclaimer: Houston has guys who can create, too. People are talking about them like they can't score. They're almost a top-10 offense. Jalen Green can be the best scorer on the floor in any game. Same for Alperen Sengun against Golden State's small lineups. This has dogfight written all over it.\n\nHerbert: Warriors in 6. The case for the Rockets is simple: They are bigger and more athletic than the Warriors, and Stephen Curry has never faced a playoff opponent this equipped to defend him. I'm going with the Warriors, though, for equally straightforward reasons: Their defense has been even better than the Rockets' since the Jimmy Butler trade, and their offense has been far superior.\n\nMaloney: Warriors in 6. The Rockets' length, athleticism and tenacious defense is going to make this a very frustrating series at times for Steph Curry and Co., but where are the baskets going to come from, especially in the clutch?\n\nQuinn: Warriors in 7. This series reminds me quite a bit of Golden State's seven-game victory over Sacramento two years ago. It's going to be a brutal, physical series, and Houston's athleticism will pose real problems, but I'm not picking a team this young against Stephen Curry.\n\nWard-Henninger: Warriors in 6. This is one of those predictions that could potentially look really bad. The Rockets are young, hungry and athletic, and we could be sitting here in two weeks talking about how slow and old they made the Warriors look. Instead, I'm going to go with what I've seen from Golden State over the past two months and posit that Houston simply won't be able to score enough to keep up with them. Either way, it's going to be an absolute slugfest.\n\nWimbish: Warriors in 7. You can say I'm underestimating the Rockets, and that may be so. But the years and years of championship experience that the Warriors have on their roster in Stephen Curry and Draymond Green matter. Not to mention Jimmy Butler, who showed that \"Playoff Jimmy\" still exists after dropping 38 points in Golden State's play-in win against the Grizzlies.\n\nWith Playoff Jimmy Butler next to Stephen Curry, Warriors show exactly why they're a threat to beat anyone Brad Botkin\n\nSeries odds: Lakers -186, Timberwolves +156\n\n\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Lakers vs. Timberwolves Lakers Lakers Lakers Lakers Lakers Lakers\n\nBotkin: Lakers in 6. Another close series. Anthony Edwards + defense is a winning formula against most teams, but the Lakers have two superstars, meaning one is going to get the double and one is going to be catching against a scrambling defense. When Edwards is inevitably doubled, do you trust Julius Randle and Minnesota's shooters to punish the Lakers? If the answer to that question is yes, Minnesota can win this series. For me, it's a no.\n\nHerbert: Lakers in 7. Luka Doncic will get to go at Rudy Gobert again, but Anthony Edwards will get to go at Doncic (and neither Dereck Lively II nor Daniel Gafford will be waiting for him in the paint this time). This is a fascinating contrast in styles, especially if JJ Redick decides to bench Jaxson Hayes and spread the Wolves out. I don't know, man. I guess I'll pick the team that will have one of the best playmakers in NBA history on the court at all times.\n\nMaloney: Lakers in 7. The Timberwolves have been awesome down the stretch, and they could win this series. This pick comes down to one thing: the Lakers will be able to keep at least one of LeBron James or Luka Dončić on the court at all times.\n\nQuinn: Lakers in 6. Minnesota will own the glass in this series, but that's not going to be enough. The Lakers have so much ball-handling that they will be able to hunt for the weak links here. The Lakers have weak links too, but given the non-shooters in Minnesota's rotation, they'll just double Anthony Edwards and make someone else beat them. The Lakers are better equipped to win that sort of series.\n\nWard-Henninger: Lakers in 7. I think the Wolves will make this a tougher series that some give them credit for, but at the end of the day I trust the postseason resumés of Luka Dončić and LeBron James when it comes to a Game 7. Anthony Edwards can go toe-to-toe with anyone and will be looking for his moment, but the Wolves lack that true second option to take some of the burden off of him.\n\nWimbish: Lakers in 6. This one is simple: Luka Dončić loves playing Minnesota. Specifically, Dončić loves playing Rudy Gobert. He alone won't beat the Wolves, but him, coupled with LeBron James and Austin Reaves are going to be a tough trio for Minnesota to contain over the course of a series.\n\nSeries odds: Nuggets +100, Clippers -118\n\n\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Nuggets vs. Clippers Clippers Clippers Clippers Clippers Clippers Clippers\n\nBotkin: Clippers in 6. This is going to be an incredible series. Nikola Jokić is the best player on earth and Jamal Murray has, for the most part, reprised his Robin role. Denver can and will extend the minutes of its starters to limit the damage the Clips can do against the bench. If that sustains, this will be a very close series. But listen, the Clippers are SUPER legit. If there's anyone to challenge Jokić as the best player in these playoffs, it might be Kawhi Leonard. He is fully back. James Harden is coming off an incredible performance against Golden State in what was essentially a playoff game and remains an All-NBA problem. The Clippers have an elite defense, an elite big man and an elite third scorer in Norman Powell. That's all around an elite 1-2 superstar punch. The more I write about them, the more I'm already preparing to pick them in round two to upset the Thunder.\n\nHerbert: Clippers in 7. Despite all the drama in Denver, the Nuggets have been virtually impossible to guard when Nikola Jokić has been on the court this season. If Jamal Murray can even approximate what he did in the 2020 and 2023 playoffs, they can win this series. I'm taking the Clippers, though, because they're the more balanced team and their best lineups have been annihilating everybody for a while. Kawhi Leonard and James Harden are going to attack Denver's weak links relentlessly, and, based on the regular season, I'm skeptical of the Nuggets' ability to problem-solve defensively.\n\nMaloney: Clippers in 6. Are we all falling for it again with the Clippers? Perhaps, but they've won 70% of their games with Kawhi Leonard in the lineup. The Nuggets, meanwhile, do not play defense and fired their coach a few days ago.\n\nQuinn: Clippers in 7. The Clippers have been the second-best team in the West for the past month or two. The Nuggets have been in some disarray all year and are about to enter the playoffs with a head coach that has three games of experience. Never underestimate the power of the reigning MVP, but the gap at every other spot is just too significant.\n\nWard-Henninger: Clippers in 6. The Clippers have been one of the best teams in the NBA over the past couple of months, and are facing a team that fired its championship-winning coach about a week ago. But that team also has Nikola Jokić, who can win -- and has won -- playoff series all by himself. Ivica Zubac is as capable as any defender against him, and the Clippers' bevy of perimeter stoppers should be able to limit Jamal Murray. If Kawhi Leonard stays healthy and James Harden is anywhere near what he was in the regular season, it's hard to see the Clippers losing.\n\nWimbish: Clippers in 7. This may be the most interesting series of the bunch in the first round. Kawhi Leonard is looking like his vintage self, James Harden has been quietly putting together an All-NBA caliber season, and, since Jan. 1, the Clippers have the fourth-best net rating in the league. I'm not discounting Nikola Jokić and the Nuggets, but at the same time, if Jamal Murray isn't operating at full strength, then this series is over."

            "content": "With six days left until the NFL draft in Green Bay, mock drafts are finalized and handed in before they are compared to the actual draft, which is expected to have a few curveballs and surprises. The San Francisco 49ers are on the clock with pick 11 unless they move up or down the trade board.\n\nMarc Ross of NFL.com has been in many war rooms during his time with the Eagles, Bills, and Giants, and admits he has never completed a mock draft, nor have front offices and scouts. Ross offered insight into how organizations prepare for the draft by going through likely scenarios for players they like and things they’ve heard from other organizations.\n\nSo, how does Ross believe the first round will shake out on the 24th? In Ross’s first mock ever, three quarterbacks will be selected in the top ten. Cam Ward, Shedeur Sanders, and Jaxson Dart are the quarterbacks, with the Saints taking Dart with the ninth overall pick.\n\nWhy is this significant for the 49ers? Any shake-up with three quarterbacks only stands to benefit the team as a premium player will essentially fall into their lap. With needs in the trenches and at linebacker next to Fred Warner, the 49ers would have their choice of many impact players if this scenario comes to fruition.\n\nAs for Ross and his thought process for the 49ers, Jihaad Campbell would be the selection at pick 11, and Warner and Campbell would form a formidable duo for years to come in San Francisco.\n\nAfter losing a number of key defensive players this offseason, including tone-setting linebacker Dre Greenlaw, the 49ers draft Campbell. The Alabama backer is my favorite player to watch in this entire draft class. He’d comprise a spectacular duo with Fred Warner.\n\nIt’s important to note that Will Campbell, Armand Membou, and Mason Graham were all off the board with the 49ers on the clock. Campbell would be an excellent addition to the 49ers as a sideline-to-sideline linebacker with great vision as a run defender. A concern for Campbell would be his propensity to bite on play action, but the Alabama linebacker can still be an asset in coverage.\n\nRobert Saleh would be tasked with developing the young linebacker, but the fit would be glove and hand. Campbell would have big shoes to fill with Greenlaw, but under Saleh and Warner’s mentorship would be stellar as a 49er."

These names include current players or memorable names from the past, some of whom are in the Hall of Fame. The Bears must not have gotten the memo.\n\nThe Packers will have multiple Vince Lombardi-era Hall of Famers in town in linebacker Dave Robinson and 89-year-old guard Jerry Kramer. Recent Packers greats like Clay Matthews, Jordy Nelson, and recently retired Mason Crosby will join the festivities alongside James Jones and Ahman Green.\n\nHow do the Bears counter? How about former early 2000s receiver Dez White, who played with the team for four years and never amassed more than 700 yards. Chicago is really bringing the star power! Maybe they can bring Devin Aromashodu next year.\n\nPackers embarrass Bears with Hall of Fame cameos during NFL Draft\n\nWhile some names on this list fall short of legendary status, the NFL took care to highlight former players who were also Wisconsin alums to get the home crowd even more fired up. White, however, is a Georgia Tech alum. Is he really the only former Bear who was available this weekend?\n\nRichard Ryman of the Green Bay Post-Gazette estimates that around 250,000 people will be in Green Bay for the three-day Draft festivities. The events will include live music for multiple days beforehand, a VIP experience, and Packers-related tours around the stadium. Brad Paisley will cap off the event with a concert.\n\nChicago may have hosted the draft twice before since it became a traveling roadshow, but Green Bay is doing everything they can to show thei rivals how to properly host this tentpole even. Unless Dez White manages to upstage multiple Hall of Famers, fans should be pretty sure that this event will be dominated by the Packers.\n\nMore Packers news and analysis"

            "content": "A college football legend is stepping away from the game.\n\nESPN announced on Thursday that Lee Corso, the longtime analyst with the network and one of the faces of College GameDay, will be stepping down after one final show, on Saturday, August 30.\n\nFor many, Corso was the face of the sport. His tradition of donning headgear to close out each week became the stuff of college football lore, and would light up social media around noon Eastern every college football Saturday.\n\nBut with one last ride on the horizon, where should that take place?\n\nOld Dominion at Indiana\n\nIt might not be the best matchup on the schedule, but Corso and GameDay heading to Indiana does make a lot of sense.\n\nPart of Corso’s origin story, and his role on College GameDay, is that of “Coach.” Coach Corso spend decades — a lifetime in fact — around the college game.\n\nWhile his coaching career included many stops, including a stint at Louisville as a head coach, where he coached future ESPN colleague Tom Jackson and led the Cardinals to just their second bowl game in school history, his longest stretch came at Indiana.\n\nCorso coached the Hoosiers for ten seasons, and led Indiana to an 8-4 record and a win in the Holiday Bowl during the 1979 campaign.\n\nOld Dominion against Indiana might not be the biggest matchup on the slate that week, but it is a case of Corso coming home one final time.\n\nAlabama at Florida State\n\nBefore he was Coach Corso, he was a player.\n\nAnd a damn good one at that.\n\nCorso was a standout on both sides of the ball during his time at Florida State, as both a defensive back and a quarterback. Corso, who went by the nickname “Sunshine Scooter” on campus, was also a roommate of former Florida State football player, and future actor, Burt Reynolds.\n\nDuring his time at Florida State he recorded 14 interceptions, which stood as a school record until it was broken over two decades later. He currently sits third on that list now, tied with another coach.\n\nDeion Sanders.\n\nSending GameDay to Tallahassee would also be a case of Corso coming home, but to where it all began for him.\n\nTexas at Ohio State\n\nWhile his playing and coaching days began elsewhere, the legend of Lee Corso on GameDay began at Ohio State.\n\nBack in October of 1996, College GameDay was in Columbus for a meeting between Penn State and Ohio State. At the end of the show when the crew made their picks, Corso punctuated his by picking up a Brutus head and putting it on, much to the delight of the assembled Buckeyes fans watching live:\n\nCorso's very first headgear pick on October 5, 1996\n\n\n\nHe will work his final GameDay show on August 30 pic.twitter.com/45HJ9Lw0it — ESPN College Football (@ESPNCFB) April 17, 2025\n\nThat was the first time Corso put on a Brutus head, but certainly not the last. According to Awful Announcing Corso has worn that headgear more than any other, 45 times during his storied run on College GameDay.\n\nIt might not be a surprise to see that number increase by one on his final show.\n\nAlso, this is a pretty good game, as it is a rematch of a College Football Playoff semifinal, and there is the Arch Manning factor."

            "content": "Roman Anthony should probably be preparing for his debut with the Boston Red Sox on Friday.\n\nIt’s just not that simple, though.\n\nAnthony has been abusing the baseball lately, capping off his torrid stretch with a pair of home runs for the Worcester Red Sox in a doubleheader victory over the Rochester Red Wings. Triple-A seemingly can’t contain him, as he’s now slashing .283/.433/.585 with four home runs and a pair of stolen bases while hitting the ball harder than anyone in the entire system.\n\nYes, this is all true, but taking an extended look at the optics of the situation pretty much tells you everything you need to know about the timing of his eventual call.\n\nBoston either needed to make it a week ago, or must wait things out until mid-summer.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMajor League Baseball has rules in place that encourage teams to promote prospects early, as the league looks to crack down on manipulating service time. The Red Sox didn’t let that influence their decision over the first few weeks of the season, but now the official date has passed where the club would lose a year on his arbitration if the 20-year-old won 2025 American League Rookie of the Year. It’s not exactly crazy to think Anthony would be in contention if promoted, so the smartest thing to do in their current state is to wait things out — for that reason, and a few more.\n\nRed Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow made an appearance on WEEI’s “Greg Hill Show” on Thursday and explained the club’s decision-making process this way.\n\n“I don’t think we want to waste anything,” Breslow said. “I think what we want to make sure is that when Roman comes to the big leagues, he’s able to step in and be successful — that there is clear opportunity for him to get the runway that he’ll need as a 20-year-old. I think there are still some development opportunities that he is tackling in Worcester right now, but we are really excited about what Roman has done thus far, and what we think he’s capable of.”\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAnthony is currently blocked in the big leagues. Jarren Duran, Ceddanne Rafaela and Wilyer Abreu are the outfield trio in Boston, with the middle man holding a distinct advantage over the rookie due to his insane glove and right-handed bat. It’s not perfect logic, but you can at least see where we’re coming from, right?\n\nNo?\n\nOK, then listen to MassLive’s Chris Cotillo, who on Thursday reported baseball’s top prospect is currently dealing with minor shoulder soreness. The Red Sox will have him back in the field soon, but until then, there’s zero chance he takes on the designated hitter role at the big league level.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox are in town for a four-game series and have a couple of unheralded pitchers slated to take the mound at Fenway Park. Anthony would probably crush them.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBoston already made its bed when it comes to the promising youngster, though.\n\nIt’s extremely unlikely that he debuts anytime soon, so just keep those thoughts on standby until Anthony falls out of contention for individual awards and back into contention for the call. It’s looking like late May or early June, folks."

            "content": "GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Corey Behnke was a 7-year-old attending a Green Bay Packers preseason game with his grandfather when he pointed to the homes across the street from Lambeau Field and vowed to live there eventually.\n\nNow he has one of the best spots to watch as the NFL’s greatest offseason spectacle takes shape.\n\nThe NFL draft’s annual pilgrimage to cities across the league is arriving in Green Bay next week with all the pageantry that comes from operating in the home of the NFL’s only publicly owned franchise.\n\n“I think it’s going to be iconic in a way that other drafts aren’t,” said Behnke, now president of the neighborhood association of the area adjacent to Lambeau Field.\n\nAs soon as the NFL started taking its draft around the country nearly a decade ago, Packers officials wondered what it would take to bring the event to Green Bay. They realized they’d never get a Super Bowl because of Green Bay’s small population and frigid February weather.\n\nHosting a draft would be the next best thing.\n\nThe possibility that Packers president/CEO Mark Murphy envisioned so long ago now becomes reality just as he prepares for his retirement this summer. As draft-related construction continues in the area around Lambeau, one of several Packers-themed signs in the yards of homes across the street from the stadium includes this message: “Draft Dreams on Murphy’s Turf.”\n\n“For us, we’d been seeing how the draft has grown and what it’s become, and knew the kind of impact it would have, not just on the local Green Bay community, but the entire state,” Murphy said. “Since we’re a community-owned team, that’s really one of our top priorities, is to give back to the community. It’ll be the largest event ever held in Green Bay.”\n\nTherein lies the challenge.\n\nThe Green Bay metro area includes about 320,000 people, according to Discover Green Bay spokesman Nick Meisner. The city itself has a population of under 110,000. Bringing the draft to a town of this size creates obstacles that league officials didn’t have to worry about when this event took place in Chicago, Philadelphia or other major metro areas.\n\nGreen Bay has about 5,000 hotel rooms, a figure that gets up to 10,000 when nearby Appleton is included. That means plenty of fans watching the draft may have to stay a couple of hours away in Milwaukee or Madison, though many of them already are accustomed to doing that for Packers home games.\n\n“When people say, can the city handle it, well, what does that mean?” Behnke asked. “Do we have enough hotels? No, but we knew that. Does Wisconsin have enough hotels? Yeah, I think so. I think a lot of people (understand) the fact that it’s going to be a driving event. People are going to drive here. But I also think that’s how games are. … I think people are kind of used to driving an hour-and-a-half or two hours to get to Green Bay.”\n\nThe smaller population likely means a smaller number of people at this draft. Murphy said a total attendance of about 250,000 is expected, less than one-third of the record crowd of over 775,000 that attended last year’s draft in Detroit. Crowd figures are measured by adding the attendance numbers for each of the draft’s three days, so one person who attends all three days would be counted three times.\n\n“The beauty of the draft is you can adapt it to any environment you’re in,” said Jon Barker, the NFL’s senior vice president for global event operations. “With each draft, there’s always going to be challenges that you need to overcome, but there’s also great opportunity.”\n\nThose opportunities involve focusing on the tradition and history of a place Behnke calls “the best football town in America.”\n\nFor instance, one of the NFL’s greatest training-camp rituals occurs at Green Bay each summer, as players borrow children’s bicycles to ride from the locker room to the practice field. Packers officials referenced this tradition in their draft bid by sending a Packers-themed bike to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s office.\n\n“We had our draft pitch in video form in the basket in the Packer bike,” said Gabrielle Dow, the Packers’ vice president of marketing and fan engagement.\n\nWithout giving too much away, Barker said part of Thursday’s draft opening will incorporate that bike tradition. A bike parade for children is planned for Saturday.\n\nThere are other local connections as well. When first-round picks hear their names called, they’ll go through a walkway featuring artwork from Milwaukee-based Ike Wynter, who will have made each of his pieces of reclaimed wood from discarded furniture collected across the state. Former Wisconsin Badgers such as Jonathan Taylor, Joe Thomas, Tim Krumrie and James White will be announcing picks on the draft’s second and third days.\n\nLambeau Field also will play a central role in this draft, though this sprawling event encompasses millions of square feet surrounding the stadium. Admission is free, and television screens all over the area will enable fans to watch the draft even if they’re far from the stage and taking in the NFL Draft Experience, a fan festival featuring games, exhibits, activities and autograph sessions.\n\nWhen probable first-round selections make their red-carpet entrance Thursday before the draft, they’ll walk onto the field known for its Frozen Tundra nickname. Fans will be able to go into the stadium to watch the draft on the giant scoreboard. The stage on which the picks are announced is in a parking lot just east of Lambeau Field.\n\n“I think it’ll be a three-day commercial not just for Green Bay but for the entire state,” Murphy said. “So many different things that are unique and special to Wisconsin, you’ll see that as a part of it.”\n\nIt also will showcase how much growth has taken place in the area around Lambeau Field.\n\nThe Resch Expo, a 125,000-square-foot facility just east of the stadium, opened in 2021 and will serve as the green room for draft prospects. The NFL Draft Experience will be at Titletown, a 45-acre development just west of Lambeau Field that features offices, shops, restaurants and apartments.\n\n“If those developments don’t happen, I don’t think we get the draft,” Meisner said.\n\nThe draft should have an economic impact of $20 million for Brown County and $90 million for Wisconsin, according to Beth Jones Schnese, Greater Green Bay Chamber vice president of marketing/member engagement. She said that equates to the amount generated by three straight Packers home-game weekends. It also means some inconveniences for local residents with all the road closures and traffic headaches.\n\nThen again, this community is used to expanding for several weekends each football season. This is just a super-sized example.\n\nBehnke knows that as well as anyone. His family has owned Packers’ season tickets since Lambeau Field opened in 1957. He was born in Green Bay, started living across from Lambeau Field full-time about five years ago and co-founded the Cheesehead TV Packers fan site.\n\nHe believes the Packers are ingrained in the Green Bay community in a way that’s different from other cities that have multiple pro sports franchises. They’re accustomed to accommodating fans who consider visiting Lambeau Field a bucket-list item.\n\n“I do think as stewards and ambassadors of the city, I think people take that very seriously,” Behnke said. “We’re not just Wisconsin nice or Minnesota nice or Midwestern nice. I think people understand we have an obligation and a responsibility to the people who come here, to show them a good time, which is what you see on gamedays. So I think that will just extend.”\n\n___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"

The Chargers plugged holes by signing players like guard Mekhi Becton, running back Najee Harris, wide receiver Mike Williams, and cornerback Donte Jackson while also bringing back edge rusher Khalil Mack, center Bradley Bozeman, and cornerback Elijah Molden.\n\nAt a press conference on Thursday, General Manager Joe Hortiz said he feels that adds up to a “really good job” that frees the team up to approach the draft without any pressing needs that would cause them to deviate from their board.\n\n“You let the board come to you,” Hortiz said, via the team’s website. “You don’t feel the pressure, so to speak, that, ‘Oh we got to address this player, we have to take this position.’ I just don’t feel that way because of the way we have spread ourselves out in free agency and adding to the roster and really completing the roster. I think that’s the goal. You want to put yourself in a position to be go to draft day and say, ‘We can literally let the board come to us. We can take the best player.’”\n\nThe Chargers can let the board with them, but having 10 picks at their disposal also means they will have ammo to use for moves around the board to assure they land the players they want the most."

            "description": "The Detroit Lions have a need at defensive tackle, and the 2025 NFL Draft class offers many options on all three days.",
            "content": "There’s been no shortage of talk about improving the Detroit Lions’ defensive line in the upcoming 2025 NFL Draft. And while Lions general manager Brad Holmes may have spoken this week about how they are not overly concerned with drafting for need, this year’s class of players offers several prospects who would meet Detroit’s qualifications of football character, high-tier talents, and, yes, filling a role that is needed.\n\nLet’s start with the defensive tackles.\n\nPrevious Lions draft previews:\n\n2025 Detroit Lions draft preview: Defensive tackle\n\nUnder contract: Alim McNeill (2028), Mekhi Wingo (2027), DJ Reader (2025), Levi Onwuzurike (2025), Roy Lopez (2025), Brodric Martin (2026), Pat O’Connor (2025), Chris Smith (2025)\n\nShort-term need: 4/10\n\nLong-term need: 7/10\n\nDetroit has a lot of bodies at the defensive tackle position for 2025, and it could theoretically be ample enough for the entire season. They’ll need reinforcements early in the year with Alim McNeill expected to miss some time into the regular season, but Wingo, Reader, Onwuzurike, Lopez, and O’Connor would make an acceptable five players on the 53-man roster while McNeill recovers.\n\nHowever, there are some serious long-term concerns here. Only three players are signed beyond this season (McNeill, Wingo, Martin), and one of those players (Martin) will be entering training camp on the outside of the roster bubble looking in. Ideally, the Lions will find a 3/5-technique to fill Onwuzurike’s role long terms, as it’s reasonable to think that with a good 2025 season, he’ll hit the open market seeking a significant raise. Wingo could fill that role long-term, but it would require a pretty significant jump in the sixth-round pick’s play.\n\nAdditionally, with Reader on the last year of his deal—and him turning 31 in July—Detroit would be wise to start thinking about a long-term plan at nose tackle.\n\nPFF top-100\n\nMason Graham, Michigan (#4 overall)\n\nWalter Nolen, Ole Miss (#8)\n\nKenneth Grant, Michigan (#17)\n\nOmarr Norman-Lott, Tennessee (#27)\n\nTyleik Williams, Ohio State (#41)\n\nDerrick Harmon, Oregon (#42)\n\nDarius Alexander, Toledo (#49)\n\nT.J. Sanders, South Carolina (#54)\n\nCJ West, Indiana (#75)\n\nShemar Turner, Texas A&M (#77)\n\nAlfred Collins, Texas (#79)\n\nVernon Broughton, Texas (#90)\n\nJordan Phillips, Maryland (#94)\n\nThere are plenty of options for the Lions on Day 1 and Day 2 of the draft, although anywhere from 2-4 players are expected to be off the board by the time the Lions are picking at 28.\n\nIf the Lions are seeking additional pass rush from the interior, but don’t want to jeopardize their ability to stop the run, Nolen and Harmon are likely their most realistic options at 28, although both could be gone. As detailed by our Ryan Mathews, Harmon sports a rare display of size (313 pounds) and athleticism, making him an ideal fit in Detroit. And while Nolen is a bit undersized and has some questions about his run defense (despite a 91.7 PFF grade), his pass rush tape is very tempting.\n\nBeyond the first round, Tyleik Williams is a potential nose tackle replacement for Detroit who may not offer much in pass rush, but was dominant, physical, and instinctive against the run. Shemar Turner is a high-energy, explosive player with the versatility to play multiple spots and boost Detroit’s pass rush, but could get pushed around a bit in the run game due to his lack of size.\n\nOne of my favorites from this group is Vernon Broughton—a late Day 2 option who may squeeze into Day 3. He only started a single season at Texas, but he’s got massive arms, decent athleticism, and plays with a level of violence that is just fun to watch. He absolutely needs refinement to his game, but with size, burst, and strength, I think he could be a pretty well-rounded player with the right coaching.\n\nNotable Day 3 players\n\nCJ West (Indiana), Ty Robinson (Nebraska), JJ Pegues (Ole Miss)\n\nWest is short (6-foot-1) and has short arms (31.5-inch), but at 316 pounds, his 10-yard split was an impressive 1.73 (second fastest among 315+ pound players at the NFL Combine). That alone is a baseline to work with. Add in the fact that he plays with an endless motor and takes to coaching makes him a good fit for a bit of a project who could even be a subpackage guy in Year 1.\n\nRobinson scored Tier 2 on our Grit Index and for good reason.\n\n“No one practices harder than Ty,” Nebraska coach Matt Rhule said. “He comes to practice every day like it’s a game, and so it makes it fun to coach.”\n\nAt 6-foot-5 (!), 288 pounds, he’s a tree trunk that even Anthony Zettel couldn’t tackle. He’s one of the most athletic defensive tackles in this class. So why could he be available on Day 3? His height betrays him at times with his pad level and his production besides last year (12.5 TFLs and 7 sacks) was minimal. Still, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Lions take him at 102.\n\nI can’t not talk about JJ Pegues, who at 6-foot-2, 309 pounds decided to do some running back drills at the NFL Combine:\n\nBoys, I think we got something here.\n\n\n\n310lb JJ Pegues is doing fullback drills out here and it absolutely looks like it would work. pic.twitter.com/ciioXCVuz0 — Brett Kollmann (@BrettKollmann) February 27, 2025\n\nPegues also scored highly on the Grit Index (top of Tier 3), as he was given the Chucky Mullins Courage Award by Ole Miss for the defensive player “that embodies the spirit of Mullins – courage, leadership, perseverance and determination.” Arriving at Auburn as a tight end (before moving to DL and then transferring to Ole Miss), he’s still learning to play with his size (6-foot- 2, 309) and power on the defensive side of the ball. But 2024 was by far his best year, with 13.5 tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks, and seven rushing touchdowns. Yes, you read that right."

Yates focused on two teams on the rise and suggested New England trade its No. 38 and No. 77 overall picks to the Washington Commanders in exchange for Nos. 29 and 128.\n\n“A theme of this Patriots offseason has been aggressiveness, as they spent huge in free agency to address several needs,” Yates wrote. “That could continue into the draft, especially if they can fill a critical need with a player late in Round 1. I’d be watching the wide receiver or offensive tackle groups. Washington, meanwhile, has only five picks and would get an earlier opportunity at No. 77 to tap into the depth of this year’s class.”\n\nNew England’s unique spot in the draft might make it more motivated to trade back into Round 1. There are a number of top-tier prospects at premium positions who could help the Patriots, but they might not be worth the fourth overall pick. So, Mike Vrabel and company theoretically could take the best player available at No. 4 and then draft more for need if they traded back into the first round.\n\nWe’ll soon find out if such a move interests the Patriots, as the 2025 draft kicks off next Thursday."

            "content": "This story is part of a group of stories called\n\nNEW YORK CITY — Cameras surrounded Paige Bueckers as she made her way into the WNBA Draft on Monday. Bueckers, the inevitable No. 1 pick in the draft, was already one of women’s basketball’s biggest names, and fittingly, ESPN projected her Instagram following onto the in-arena jumbotron, which showcased she would immediately be one of the most-followed athletes in the WNBA.\n\nAbout a dozen other women’s college basketball stars also meandered into The Shed in Hudson Yards, the sleek Manhattan building where the draft was held. For the second year in a row, fans could purchase tickets and attend. This year, general admission tickets were going for twice the price, up from $49 to $99.\n\nAmong the stars were Hailey Van Lith, who was accompanied by TCU coach Mark Campbell, her parents, and her boyfriend, Orlando Magic guard Jalen Suggs. Kentucky guard Georgia Amoore, styled by NBA star Russell Westbrook, sat front and center with her family.\n\nThen there was Kiki Iriafen, who arrived with her family, all of whom donned traditional Nigerian attire.\n\n“I wanted to look good, I wanted to feel good,” Iriafen said in her post-Draft interview. “This dress was designed by Nigerian designer Nneka Alexander and I just wanted to show off my culture on this big stage.”\n\nAnd it was worthwhile for Iriafen to wear such a special outfit — because the 2025 WNBA Draft was a massive stage.\n\nThe two-hour program averaged 1.25 million viewers, the league announced, the second-most of any draft in WNBA history.\n\nNo, it didn’t compare to the 2024 WNBA Draft, which Caitlin Clark headlined last spring. That draft saw nearly twice the viewership, averaging 2.4 million viewers, in large part due to Clark’s unprecedented popularity, as well as the myriad of other big names in the class, like Angel Reese and Cameron Brink.\n\nBut 2025 shouldn’t be compared to 2024\n\nFor one, the 2024 Draft came off the heels of a record-breaking championship game between LSU and Iowa.\n\nAnd two, because Clark has already demonstrated she single-handedly uplifts viewership numbers in a way few others have been able to.\n\nSix WNBA networks set ratings records last season — and all six featured games headlined by Clark. Of the top 15 most-viewed games last WNBA season, Clark appeared in 14.\n\nClark’s final three college games — an Elite 8 matchup against LSU, a Final Four matchup against UConn, and a championship game against South Carolina — became the three most-watched women’s college basketball games ever.\n\nSo, there are zero questions about whether women’s basketball receives a massive ratings boost when Clark is involved.\n\nThe question is, what about when she’s not?\n\nAlready, 2025 has shown itself to be an excellent year when it comes to women’s basketball ratings — the 2025 NCAA tournament was the second-most-viewed women’s tournament on record.\n\nAnd, despite quickly turning into a blowout, the national championship game between UConn and South Carolina had the third-highest viewership since ESPN began carrying the tournament in 1996, per ESPN.\n\nThe rise of illegal streaming and potentially inflated Nielsen numbers make cross-era comparisons imperfect, but it’s clear that what’s happened the past two years in women’s basketball is monumental.\n\nThe WNBA Draft saw more viewers than the NHL, MLB\n\nInstead of being compared to the 2025 WNBA Draft, viewership numbers relating to the 2025 WNBA Draft should be compared to other sports.\n\nThe 2024 NHL Draft, for example, averaged 502,000 viewers. More than twice as many people tuned in to watch Bueckers and the rest of the prospects enter than Macklin Celebrini and his class join the NHL.\n\nThe MLB Draft’s first round averaged 863,000 viewers. Baseball — America’s pastime — has been trumped by women’s basketball when it comes to draft night.\n\nBefore 2024, the WNBA Draft never exceeded 601,000 viewers. That number came when Diana Taurasi finished a storied UConn career in 2004.\n\nThese recent numbers are a massive jump from recent years; per The Athletic, in 2020, the WNBA Draft drew 387,000 viewers. In 2021, it drew 331,000 viewers, and in 2022, it drew 403,000 viewers.\n\nThe 2025 #WNBADraft on ESPN delivered the second most-viewed WNBA Draft ever, averaging 1.25M viewers\n\n\n\n1.46M peak\n\nMost-viewed program across ALL TV among M18-34, M18-49 & P18-34\n\nTop cable program among M25-54, P18-49 & P25-54 pic.twitter.com/io5HdjpuSF — ESPN PR (@ESPNPR) April 15, 2025\n\nOn Monday, the WNBA Draft was the most-viewed program across all of television among males 18-49, and all adults 18-34. It also surpassed two other major pro sports.\n\nEven as recent as five years ago, few could have imagined that more people would tune into a women’s basketball draft than the MLB or NHL’s draft — but women’s basketball has come a long way. And, the next crop of stars — USC’s JuJu Watkins, Notre Dame’s Hannah Hidalgo, UCLA's Lauren Betts — indicates that this growth could be sustained for years to come."

            "content": "NFL Draft analyst Todd McShay made the best case yet for why the Washington Commanders may go defense in the first round. In his Todd Mock 3.0, McShay selected Georgia Bulldog Safety Malaki Starks at 29 for the Washington Commanders. He selected a defensive back over other considerations at running back, offensive line, and edge. That can be a head-scratcher to some, and I’m sure wide receiver is among the positions others would consider at 29 as well. In the latest Trap or Dive podcast, Todd McShay joined the show and explained his thought process for why the Commanders most likely go defense, position-aside, over an offensive player because Washington has successfully identified their quarterback.\n\nMock 3.0! — My Mock 4.0 will release next Wednesday, one day before the NFL Draft. If you don’t already, go subscribe to The McShay Report (https://t.co/Js9k32hZDW) to get it delivered to your inbox! pic.twitter.com/gcQYNFWX95 — Todd McShay (@McShay13) April 15, 2025\n\n“Think about like the Baltimore Ravens, right? One of the organizations in the playoffs almost every year. They’re always picking in the mid to late 20s or 30s. They are one of the most patient organizations out there, and their patience gets paid off just about every year in the draft and it’s maybe it’s sticking there at 22 or 24 or it’s trading back just a few spots to a team that’s getting anxious right and they always wind up with a player you’re like I never thought he was going to be there and I think now the Commanders, there’s like, now you’re in this now you’re at the big boy table.”\n\nTo be at the big boy table, you have to have a quarterback in place, which gives you the freedom to find difference-makers defensively because a Jayden Daniels-led offense will undoubtedly score points.\n\n“If you go back and study all these really good organizations that are always in the playoffs, Chiefs, the Bills now, the Eagles, especially the Packers, the Ravens, every one of them, if you go study their draft history, go year by year, once they identified like, yeah, that’s our guy at quarterback. It’s like they took this sharp left turn, and every draft after that, and I’m talking three-four years like they’re still doing it. You know why? in talking to these GMs. Two reasons. One, because my guy is going to make up for the sins of 10 guys on that side of the ball. But he can’t help those guys on that side of the ball. So, we better get great with personnel on that side of the ball.”\n\nMore importantly than difference-makers, the Commanders need closers, and the GMs that McShay has gotten a chance to have conversations with and study understand the importance of finishing games on the defensive side of the football.\n\n“I remember talking to Bill Polian, the old GM for the Colts when he came and worked at ESPN. One of his big things was that we had to get pass rushers on that turf. I can remember how passionate he was. We had to have closers, guys who could close the game. Talking to Howie Roseman at the combine. He said the same way, “We had we had to find closers.” The Commanders are in a position now that they have their guy, and they can be patient and sit back. If it’s an edge rusher, awesome. But if it’s not, then we take a player that everyone in the league thinks is one of the 20, 24, 25 best players in the league in Starks, and let’s take him and get a difference maker.”\n\nYou can listen to the full Trap or Dive episode with Todd McShay below.

I can't do that. Jones was a terrible selection by a general manager who convinced himself of something nobody else saw. Dave Gettleman called his shot and missed. That mistake was then compounded by a contract extension from an out-of-his-depth, rookie GM trying to make the world's greatest meal out of leftovers.\n\nBut Jones and the New York Giants had one miraculous season that actually saw them win a playoff game. The Giants have won one playoff game in the last 13 seasons. That actually happened, and it mattered to me, and it cannot be forgotten despite that mess. It's what didn't happen with another pick that looms much larger than the Danny Dimes debacle.\n\nAs the 2021 draft unfolded, things couldn't have looked any brighter for the WR-needy Giants waiting at No. 11.\n\nDeVonta Smith was the No. 1 receiver on the B/R NFL Scouting Dept. big board and the No. 5 overall prospect. Some teams downgraded him for his lack of size, but that would work great for New York. The Giants were taking Smith at No. 11, if he was there, and people knew it. Giants fans had every right to be excited...until they didn't.\n\nEnter Howie Roseman, the Philadelphia Eagles' shot-caller and the master move-maker of the NFL. Roseman picked up the phone, as he tends to do, and called the rival Dallas Cowboys, who held the No. 10 pick. The Cowboys let the Eagles jump the Giants to draft Smith instead, leaving Big Blue with an empty ice cream cone as the ice cream truck drove away.\n\nBut if you didn't think it could get any worse than your two most-hated rivals conspiring to screw you out of your draft target, it did.\n\nThe Giants outsmarted themselves, again. Gettleman at his best. They traded down from No. 11, dropping to No. 20 overall, leaving the Cowboys to take Micah Parsons with the previously owned Eagles pick. The same Micah Parsons who claims the Giants told him they would take him if he were on the board.\n\nIt's not like the Giants couldn't have used Parsons. All he's done in his career is rack up double-digit sacks each of the four seasons he's been in the league. The Giants, meanwhile, have had only one player notch double-digit sacks in a season during that span—Kayvon Thibodeaux—who they ended up drafting only a year after passing on Parsons. And yet, this nightmare still isn't over.\n\nNow at 20 overall, still needing a playmaker, the Giants took Kadarius Toney. He was the 11th-ranked receiver and 60th overall player on the B/R big board. A reach by anyone's standard. A gadget player who'd be a nice luxury pick for a coaching staff with a solid plan on how to incorporate him. Essentially, the exact opposite of a team trying to give the aforementioned Jones project a legitimate No. 1 target.\n\nToney wound up playing in 12 total games for the Giants over less than two seasons. He scored zero touchdowns. He was ultimately traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for a compensatory third-round selection, which was later traded for tight end Darren Waller, who retired from football after only one season in New York.\n\nThe draft is meant to be an exciting, hopeful time. For a few minutes, the 2021 draft was exactly that. Then, Big Blue got screwed out of their draft top target by their two biggest rivals. Said rivals both wound up with players who've terrorized the Giants the four seasons since. And then they drafted Toney.\n\nThe Giants didn't just get the pick wrong; they got the art of the draft wrong. They let their intentions be known. They fell prey to their own \"brilliance.\" From the minute Philadelphia jumped New York, the 2021 draft was lost and the Giants somehow found a way to make it even worse, and it's still being felt to this day."

Last year is a good example of this.

That is a strange feeling, given it’s truly the only position on the roster in dire need of a starter. The cupboard is bare after Cam Heyward and Keeanu Benton. But I’m sticking with this tier being addressed with their first selection.\n\nHarmon is the only one of these gentlemen who visited the Steelers for a top 30 visit. He’s an athletic three-tech who burst onto the scene for the Oregon Ducks this past season.\n\nThey did meet with Grant at the combine but haven’t shown much interest in Nolen.\n\nPlayers like Grant or Harmon would allow the Steelers to play consistently in their base alignment, demand double teams - and finally free up the linebackers so they can have more flexibility.\n\nKenneth Grant is a MENACE at the center of a defense.\n\n\n\nHe constantly draws double teams but has still managed 8 sacks, 50 pressures, and 39 run stops in the last two seasons.\n\n\n\nHe’s all of 6’3, 342lbs and is an INCREDIBLE athlete at that size. Could end up a top 10 pick. pic.twitter.com/ugjrmahM6Z — NFL Draft Files (@NFL_DF) January 31, 2025\n\nRound 3, Pick 83:\n\nThis should get Yinz talking, but I simply can’t ignore the Steelers’ interest in quarterbacks. Either they are going to draft one or are giving off a Snoop Dogg-esque smoke screen.\n\nI think we’re all in agreement. The best value would actually be bypassing this class of quarterbacks for next year’s class, but they aren’t thinking that way.\n\nShough has been a speculative fast riser, but I won’t be surprised if he has a seismic fall. He’s going to be 26 years old and didn’t put together a strong season until this past year at Louisville.\n\nHoward has the size and mobility the team is likely searching for. They had dinner with him at his pro day.\n\nMcCord had a really poor debut campaign at Ohio State - but had an impressive bounce-back season at Syracuse, leading the ACC in passing yards.\n\nIf Pittsburgh doesn’t address the position in the third round - I don’t think they will at all.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I wouldn’t be a big fan of this selection. But it’s the way I’m leaning.\n\nRound 4, Pick 123:\n\nThe second tier of running backs is so much better than the second tier of defensive tackles. It feels like the Steelers have done a good job evaluating the opportunity cost here. Why am I so confident in that? Well, all four of these explosive backs jumped on a plane to visit Pittsburgh for a pre-draft workout.\n\nExplosive is the operative word.\n\nTuten and Blue registered the two fastest 40-yard dash times at the NFL combine. Giddens and Harvey are more well-rounded and have a higher likelihood of being three-down backs.\n\nIn any other draft, these guys are probably drafted in rounds two or three.\n\nChecking out UCF RB R.J. Harvey who was one of the #Steelers pre draft visits\n\n\n\nHas an elite jump cut with + speed & vision. Finishes runs well, but needs to protect himself better.\n\n\n\nThis is one of my favorite clips I’ve seen of any RB in this class\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/vOHWQsBqza — Steelers Blitz (@Steelers_Blitz) April 12, 2025\n\nRound 5, Pick 156:\n\nSavion Williams, WR, TCU\n\nTai Felton, WR, Maryland\n\nJaCorey Brooks, WR, Louisville\n\nWilliams is a unique prospect who will likely be drafted earlier. He looks like he was built in a lab. His tape is incredible, but his production wasn’t all that inspiring. He compiled 60 catches for 611 yards last season, but both were easily his best in his five years.\n\nFelton is an intriguing prospect who has elite speed and can immediately contribute in the slot, with the potential to eventually be a Z receiver.\n\nSomeone who should be on the board here is Brooks. I’m calling him as a sleeper pick here. He didn’t meet with the Steelers, but they must be plenty familiar with him given the research they did on his QB Tyler Shough. He was Shough’s go-to guy, posting over 1,000 yards and 9 TDs last season.\n\nFormer five-star recruit and Alabama transfer Ja'Corey Brooks is living up to the billing at Louisville.\n\n\n\nBig-time catch and run. Has 3 catches for 121 yards and 2 touchdowns against SMU. https://t.co/otixhRDN7Y pic.twitter.com/ZTYqmTaIma — Pete Nakos (@PeteNakos_) October 5, 2024\n\nRound 6, Pick 185:\n\nWillie Lampkin, G, North Carolina\n\nCharles Grant, T/G, William and Mary\n\nTyler Cooper, G, Minnesota\n\nThe Steelers are going to draft a guard at some point during this draft; while the starters are penciled in, they lost James Daniels to the Miami Dolphins in free agency. Assistant GM Andy Wiedl will continue to address the trenches, as there isn’t a ton of depth up front for the black and gold.\n\nRound 7, Pick 229:\n\nSmael Mondon Jr., LB, Georgia\n\nCarson Bruener, LB, Washington\n\nJay Higgins, LB, Iowa State\n\nPittsburgh lost Elandon Roberts this offseason, and Cole Holcomb’s health is still in question.\n\nMondon is the prize of this group, but the interesting name to watch is Bruener. That name may ring a bell. He’s the son of former Steelers TE Mark Bruener — and we know how much the Steelers love their bloodlines!\n\nNote: No cornerback. I think they are comfortable with that room, considering Cory Trice Jr. and Beanie Bishop are entrenched behind Joey Porter Jr. and the newly acquired Darius Slay. Don’t forget second-year DB Ryan Watts could also be returning to the fray.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this draft strategy? Let us know in the comments section!"

The Tigers defeated Michigan State (197.3625) on the night.\n\nFreshman phenom Kailin Chio wrapped up a sensational freshman campaign by claiming the 2025 NCAA Vault Champion title with her score of 9.9750, the 19th individual national championship won by a Tiger and eighth on vault.\n\nThe Tigers opened the night on the beam, with leadoff freshman Lexi Zeiss grabbing a 9.9000 to start things off. Junior Ashley Cowan scored a 9.8125 in the second spot, followed by a 9.8250 from freshman Kailin Chio in spot three. Senior Aleah Finnegan scored a 9.8500 in the fourth spot ahead of a 9.8750 from sophomore Konnor McClain. The anchor spot saw senior Haleigh Bryant score a 9.8750 of her own to give the Tigers a 49.3250 team score in the rotation.\n\nLSU was in third place after the opening rotation with a 49.3250, trailing UCLA (49.5250) and Michigan State (49.3875).\n\nRotation two saw LSU compete on the beam. Graduate student Sierra Ballard scored a 9.8750 to open the rotation ahead of a 9.8000 from sophomore Kylie Coen in the second spot. Spot three saw Chio score a 9.8750 before sophomore Konnor McClain grabbed a 9.90 in spot four. Bryant scored a 9.8750 in the fifth spot before Finnegan concluded the rotation with a 9.2250 due to a fall from the beam. The rotation score came out to a 49.3250.\n\nAt the halfway point, LSU’s 98.6500 ranked fourth in the meet behind Michigan State (98.8375), Utah (98.7750) and UCLA (98.7625).\n\nThe third rotation took the Tigers to the floor, with sophomore Konnor McClain leading things off with a 9.8625. Ballard scored a 9.8250 in the second spot before Chio scored a 9.8875 in spot three. In the fourth spot, sophomore Amari Drayton scored a 9.9000 ahead of a 9.9375 from Finnegan in spot five. The anchor spot saw Bryant keep her strong night rolling with a 9.9125 to help boost the Tigers to a 49.5000 score for the rotation.\n\nHeading into the final rotation of the night, the margins were narrow, with LSU’s 148.1500 ranking them second behind UCLA (148.1875) and ahead of Utah (148.1125) and Michigan State (148.0000).\n\nLSU concluded the night on the vault, with senior KJ Johnson opening the rotation with a 9.8375. Zeiss scored a 9.8000 in spot two before Finnegan posted a 9.8500 score in the third spot and then a 9.8125 from Drayton after her. The fifth spot saw Chio execute a near perfect yurchenko one and a half that scored a 9.9750 and was followed up by a 9.9000 from Bryant in the anchor position to bring LSU’s final rotation score of the night to a 49.3750, which was not enough to bring the Tigers to a top two finish to advance to the final round on Saturday.\n\nIndividually, Chio’s 9.9750 stood alone at the top of the vault competition and meant that she took home the 2025 NCAA vault title. The win marked the first vault title won by a Tiger since 2021, when freshman Haleigh Bryant took home the crown. Chio joined elite company as she became the third freshman in program history to win an individual national championship along with Bryant and Kennedi Edney (2017).\n\nThe Tigers score finished fourth across both semifinal sessions on Thursday. Finnegan and Bryant finished amongst the top 10 performers on the day. Bryant finished fifth on vault and tenth on floor while Finnegan finished fifth on floor.\n\nChio finished tied with Bryant in sixth in the all-around in her first nationals appearance as a freshman.\n\nLSU’s third place finish brings an end to what has been a historical season for the Tigers that was highlighted by a regular season championship, its sixth SEC Championship in program history, the program’s first No. 1 seed ever and the programs 15th regional championship.\n\nLSU’s third place finish brings an end to what has been a historical season for the Tigers that was highlighted by a regular season championship, its sixth SEC Championship title, their first No. 1 seed ever and the program’s 15th regional championship.\n\n2025 NCAA Championship Semifinal Scores (Both Sessions)\n\nSemifinal I\n\nOklahoma 197.5500\n\nMissouri 197.3000\n\nFlorida 197.2000\n\nAlabama 196.8250\n\nSemifinal II\n\nUtah 197.7625\n\nUCLA 197.7375\n\nLSU 197.5250\n\nMichigan State 197.3625"

            "content": "Anybody who has ever been to a rock concert can tell you: Lasers and weed go together like peanut butter and jelly. “If only,” many a stoner has undoubtedly mused. “There were some way I could use a laser to smoke my weed…” Well, my red-eyed friend, we’ve already got a laser bong. Now there’s a laser vape. Meet Luminary’s The Beam, a handheld, pocket-sized vaporizer that uses a class-1 laser you can actually see to heat weed extracts. I thought for sure it was a gimmick. Turns out, it’s rather ingenious for a first-generation product.\n\nLet’s start with the basic. From the outside the Beam doesn’t look much different from other handheld vaporizers. It has a black metal body that measures, 4 x 2 x 1 inches and weighs 7 ounces. It disappeared into the front pocket of my (fairly skinny) jeans without issue. If you pop out the bottom compartment you’ll see a little cylinder cartridge in a holder, and that’s where you put your goodies. It’s a modular system so you can swap in thicker concentrates or thinner oils (more on that in a minute). The device has just one button for turning it on/off, adjusting temperature, and firing the eponymous beam. On the other side is a glass window where you can actually see the blue laser beam streak through the vapor-filled chamber, and yes, it is very cool looking.\n\nLuminary Beam It's finicky but who cares? There's a LASER.

There’s actually a functional reason for it. Most concentrate vaporizers (including all the disposable pens and such) use metal wires or coils to heat up the oil. This can cause a number of issues, including metal residue and corrosion, uneven heating (and burning), terpene (the compounds in your weed that gives it its flavor and some psychoactive effects) breakdown, and a notorious and unpleasant metallic taste. This cartridge system doesn’t have any metal in it (which also means no e-waste). It’s just pure light hitting your product of choice against a black ceramic tile. The result is you get unadulterated flavor, even heating, and very smooth vapor (especially at the lower temperatures).\n\nOpening the box is at first a little overwhelming because it’s pretty packed with accessories. There’s a metal tool for loading and stirring, a silicone sleeve thing (that I later learned is to hold the metal tool), some cleaning tools, one cartridge for oils (of the runnier variety), one extra cartridge for concentrates (of the stickier variety), instructions, and a USB charging cable. The vaporizer itself has one cartridge already in it. You going to want to read those instructions, because the worst thing I can say about this device is that it isn’t very intuitive to use. As I was going through it I found myself feeling very grateful that I was sober, but once you get the hang of it, it’s actually pretty easy.\n\nFor the concentrates cartridge, use the little metal tool to scoop up some thicker concentrate about the size of a grain of rice. Then you play your own little game of Operation to try and get that goop down onto the tiny black ceramic plate in the middle of the white ceramic cartridge. It’s certainly a bit fiddly. You’ll scrape the goop off on the sides of the little window, but the laser can’t really get to it there, so you’ll want to use the pokey end of the tool to try and push the stuff down into the little hole. Then you reinsert the cartridge into the base plate and fit it back into the vaporizer. The concentrates cartridge has a silicone cylinder at the base of it, which is just for holding more concentrate, making the whole thing a bit more portable.\n\nThe oil cartridge is a bit more work up front, but then it stays ready to use for a while, more like a vape pen. You screw the top off and load your oil into the (food-grade) plastic cylinder at the bottom (I was told this will be upgraded to borosilicate glass in the next version). This is for runnier oils, that typically come in a syringe, so loading it in is easy enough, and it’s designed to hold 0.95 grams of material (Luminary is partnering with some farms to release pre-filled cartridges soon). Then you screw the top back on which looks similar to the concentrates top, but has a longer “wick” that dips down into the container below. I say “wick” because that’s how it functions, but it (and the black plate in the concentrates cartridge) is actually a type of ceramic, similar the heat tiles on spacecraft, which nets this thing two extra cool-points.\n\nOnce your cartridge of choice is loaded, with the device turned off, you hold down the power button to cycle through the different power levels. It starts on white, which is the hottest at about 400 degrees. Then it cycles down to green (lowest power), then blue (medium power). Again, this isn’t intuitive, but it’s fine once you get the hang of it. For the next version, I’d recommend it start at green/low and go up from there rather than starting at the top. Once your power-level is set, you press the button three times rapidly, and the device buzzes to let you know it’s powered-on and ready. Then you just hold down the button, and inhales as the beam blasts into your substance of choice for as long as you hold it down.\n\nOne of the benefits of the laser system is that it’s instantly on. Other handheld vapes (like the excellent DaVinci ICQ) can take up to a minute for their little ovens to heat up. A laser is either on or off. It can take a few puffs before the goop melts onto the black plate and it really gets going, though, especially the oil cartridge, but once it’s going it’s about as fast as an instant-inhale vape pen. The glass chamber glows blue, and if you blow a little of the vapor back into the mouthpiece, the laser shows up bright and clear, which has some real wow-factor.\n\nAnd what’s the verdict on how it works?\n\nOh my goodness it’s tasty and smooth. For the oil cartridge I used some fairly liquidy live resin from Jetty Extracts, and I found that the low setting was incredible. It tasted delicious, almost like fresh flower, and I really felt like I was getting all those subtle little terpenes in there. It also hit so smoothly that I wasn’t sure if I was getting anything until I exhaled, and a big cloud came out. I also tried it at the medium power level, which produced a thicker cloud, but it was a bit more harsh and chokey for my sweet, innocent lungs. I turned it up to white (in the name of science) and it tasted noticeably burned. I didn’t really enjoy the flavor and it made me cough, too (though, in fairness, I’m not a big smoker or vaper), so I preferred keeping it on low.\n\nFor the concentrates cartridge I mostly used some more viscous live resin (upwards of 80-percent THC) from Raw Garden, which is known for making extremely pure concentrates, as well as some Live Resin Diamonds (92 to 96-percent pure) I had lying around from a previous review. For those, the medium/blue setting seemed to be the sweet spot. Again, the flavors were absolutely delicious, and the cloud I exhaled was unexpectedly thick, not to mention potent. The vaporizer vibrates every two seconds while the laser is engaged which helps you gauge your dose. That’s smart, because it hits so smoothly you might very well over-shoot your first couple of times and become one with your living room furniture.\n\nIt’s recommended that you take the time to clean the various components fairly frequently. Most important would be the glass lens that the laser shoots through. Obviously, if that gets cloudy that’s going to reduce the amount of light (and therefore heat) that gets to the goods. It comes with a couple foam-tipped swabs (Q-Tips aren’t recommended because cotton fibers may block the lens), which you dib in rubbing alcohol and use to wipe any residue off. It’s also recommended that you clean the cartridges and cores, also with alcohol, every couple of weeks or so, depending how frequently you’re using it.\n\nIt’s worth noting that this is a first-generation product (they’ve shipped the first 500 to early backers, and the next batch of 1,000 is in pre-order now, shipping 4/20/2025), and as such there are definitely some things that could be improved. I already mentioned that the oil cartridge’s reservoir will soon be glass, which is good, since the less plastic that come in contact with your concentrates the better. Personally, I’d like to see a second button added, so you’ve got a separate button for temperature control. More granular temp control would be cool, too (the DaVinci mentioned above can be adjusted in one-degree increments).\n\nI’d really like to see them figure out a way for the metal scooping/stirring tool to be housed within the body of the device itself, too. The silicone sleeve it comes with to attach the tool to the outside of the device adds a fair amount of bulk, and your pockets would get very sticky/stinky since it doesn’t cover either end. Luminary is at least in the late-stages of developing an accessory that will help alleviate some of that. Currently in late-stage prototype is a next-gen version of the concentrates cartridge called the “EverDabber.” This would work a bit more like the oil cartridge, where you load a larger reservoir, but once you do you can click a wheel to load the concentrate from the reservoir into the little chamber that ignites. It will dispense in 25-milligram increments, which should help you monitor your dosage, too. This will be an optional accessory, likely launching in the next few months. (Luminary is working on a cartridge for dry herb, too, but that’s likely much further out).\n\nThose gripes aside, this thing is unexpectedly great. I wanted to make sure that it wasn’t just me, though, so I brought it to a party where I could test it with three friends who are much heavier smokers. They were loading up a very large bong when I interrupted them and asked if they wanted to try the Beam. I had the oil cartridge in place and the temperature set to low, and all three of them absolutely loved it. They said it was delicious and crazy smooth. All three said they don’t normally like oils or concentrates, but this was so good they all wanted to know how much it was. When I told them that it’s $200, they all thought it was well worth it, and I do, too.\n\nBeyond looking cool (which it absolutely does) the laser works really well. It heats up fast, it tastes great, and it’s very easy on the throat and lungs. I’m definitely interested in checking out the EverDabber accessory, which will make fiddling with the metal tool a less-frequent endeavor, and I look forward to seeing what they cook up for the next generation, but for now, this is the smoothest portable concentrate vaporizer I’ve ever used. Plus, y’know… frickin’ lasers…"

The company first released the Hotfix build for the Galaxy S24 series and later expanded it to the Z Flip 6, Z Fold 6, and Fold SE.\n\nWe understand the delay is cautionary, but users in the US and worldwide have been waiting for the One UI 7 update for quite a long time. Samsung should now bring the update to eligible users and shift its focus to expansion for older models.\n\nOn April 10, Samsung initiated One UI 7 distribution for the Galaxy S24 users in the US and Europe. However, a serious issue identified in some Korean models has led to the expansion being temporarily suspended globally.\n\nSamsung acted quickly in identifying the cause of the problem and addressing it. Korean rollout has resumed on April 17, but the new build is still awaited by users of the Galaxy S24 series living outside Samsung’s home ground.\n\nThe Android 15 upgrade for Samsung phones comes with an all-new design. The software brings intelligent features like Now Bar and Live Notifications that uplevel the user experience and streamline Galaxy’s notifications and updates.\n\nOne UI 7 has been delayed by a historic period, but Samsung is working to make it the last such halt. One UI 8 is in the works, and the official version is almost confirmed to be introduced with the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 this year.\n\nAdvertisement"

            "content": "A new animated kids’ series expected to premiere this year won’t be headed for a TV network. Or a streaming service. Instead, the founders of production studio We Ghosted Media plan to launch on a decentralized web platform that uses blockchain technology.\n\nAnd yes, a crypto wallet will be involved.\n\nWe Ghosted Media — founded by Chris Jammal, an assistant director for “Bob’s Burgers,” and Jaclynn Demas, producer of hit children’s show “Peg + Cat” — is a TV production studio abandoning traditional show release methods in favor of a decentralized approach, commonly referred to as web3.\n\nThe studio announced Friday it was teaming up with Lamina1 to launch the new animated kids’ series entitled “Owen Nowhere.”\n\nLamina1 was founded by “Snow Crash” author Neal Stephenson and launched in 2022 as a Layer 1 blockchain platform designed to give creators an environment to protect, control, and monetize their intellectual property. Lamina1’s overarching mission, however, is to build an open metaverse. Stephenson’s vision of the metaverse — a concept he coined in his 1992 acclaimed novel — consists of a virtual world where users get their own lifelike 3D avatar.\n\nBlockchain technology and the metaverse are buzzwords in the tech world and they have been slow to achieve mass adoption. Introducing a kids’ show in this space is particularly bold, considering the production studio will have to figure out how kids will navigate a platform that requires a crypto wallet.\n\nBut Jammal and Demas are banking on the freedom of a decentralized platform, which allows the audience to interact and even participate, as a selling point that will win over users.\n\nImage Credits:We Ghosted Media\n\nThe new show centers around Owen B. Gloom, a preteen aspiring content creator on a family road trip, documenting their visits to unusual tourist attractions. The family’s dynamic is funny, sweet, and slightly dysfunctional, featuring Owen’s adoptive vampire parents, a magical transforming vehicle, a pet cat, and a fish in a stroller.\n\nBut as Jammal and Demas told TechCrunch, this is more than a show. It’s really about their mission to set a “new standard for the future of children’s entertainment in the decentralized era.”\n\nThe project will be developed and viewable on Lamina1’s yet-to-be-launched Spaces, an offering that enables creators to create their own virtual worlds. In these worlds, creators can build interactive experiences, digital items, and content in various formats, including 2D, 3D, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR).\n\nJammal and Demas envision “Owen Nowhere” as an immersive experience that allows fans to engage with the world and contribute their ideas for the series.\n\nThe virtual space will also include exclusive behind-the-scenes content, collectible digital assets, and online community-driven experiences like voting. The studio believes that the most attractive feature is the opportunity for viewers to make key decisions for the story, such as suggesting destinations for the family’s adventures.\n\n“We were thinking [fans could] vote for where the Glooms can travel next. Do you want them to come to your hometown? Maybe they want to buy that souvenir that Owen picked up at the Grand Canyon [as] their own digital asset. Maybe they want to change his outfit. There are so many possibilities of how this can go,” Jammal said.\n\nImage Credits:We Ghosted Media\n\nWhile it’s clear that this show has all the ingredients to resonate with viewers and hold their attention, there will be challenges, including convincing parents to manage a crypto wallet for their child.\n\nParents may worry that introducing kids to this ecosystem, even indirectly, could expose them to financial manipulation or loss, even if the parents are the ones in control of the wallet.\n\nHowever, some parents are more open to the idea, with some sending their five-year-olds to crypto summer camps. In 2022, Zigazoo introduced NFTs for several IPs, including CoComelon.\n\n“It’s a big topic of discussion. It’s like, ‘What permissions do we need in place around it?’” Lamina1 CEO Rebecca Barkin said, adding, “I won’t tell you that we have the perfect answer right now…we’re going to learn real fast as this develops, what protections need to be put in place.”\n\nOwen Nowhere’s digital assets are positioned as a way for fans to be involved in the show and enable them to contribute financially to the show’s production by owning digital collectibles — including artwork, characters, and outfits — fostering a community of supporters who are invested in its success.\n\n“That token can be used as a loyalty token, it doesn’t have to be about cash and trading and the traditional crypto stuff. It’s about token-gated access and rewarding those who are sharing things, who are making really creative contributions to the community,” Barkin explained.\n\nWhile the new series is primarily aimed at kids and preteens, it’s also designed to appeal to adults. This is similar to how “Bob’s Burgers” attracts many adult fans through its hilarious storylines about parenting.\n\n“We’re not going after that super young demographic,” said Barkin.\n\nNonetheless, they may need to approach this with transparency and possibly even parental controls to appeal to their entire audience.\n\nLamina1’s Spaces product is slated to launch in the fall. Another virtual world launching on Spaces is “Artefact,” a project by visual effects company Wētā, known for its work on the “Lord of the Rings” film trilogy.\n\nLamina1 has raised $9 million to date from notable investors and angels, such as LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Bloq co-founder Matthew Roszak."

            "content": "When it comes to actually storing the numerical weights that power a large language model's underlying neural network, most modern AI models rely on the precision of 16- or 32-bit floating point numbers. But that level of precision can come at the cost of large memory footprints (in the hundreds of gigabytes for the largest models) and significant processing resources needed for the complex matrix multiplication used when responding to prompts.\n\nNow, researchers at Microsoft's General Artificial Intelligence group have released a new neural network model that works with just three distinct weight values: -1, 0, or 1. Building on top of previous work Microsoft Research published in 2023, the new model's \"ternary\" architecture reduces overall complexity and \"substantial advantages in computational efficiency,\" the researchers write, allowing it to run effectively on a simple desktop CPU. And despite the massive reduction in weight precision, the researchers claim that the model \"can achieve performance comparable to leading open-weight, full-precision models of similar size across a wide range of tasks.\"\n\nWatching your weights\n\nThe idea of simplifying model weights isn't a completely new one in AI research. For years, researchers have been experimenting with quantization techniques that squeeze their neural network weights into smaller memory envelopes. In recent years, the most extreme quantization efforts have focused on so-called \"BitNets\" that represent each weight in a single bit (representing +1 or -1).\n\nThe new BitNet b1.58b model doesn't go quite that far—the ternary system is referred to as \"1.58-bit,\" since that's the average number of bits needed to represent three values (log(3)/log(2)). But it sets itself apart from previous research by being \"the first open-source, native 1-bit LLM trained at scale,\" resulting in a 2 billion token model based on a training dataset of 4 trillion tokens, the researchers write.\n\nThe \"native\" bit is key there, since many previous quantization efforts simply attempted after-the-fact size reductions on pre-existing models trained at \"full precision\" using those large floating-point values. That kind of post-training quantization can lead to \"significant performance degradation\" compared to the models they're based on, the researchers write. Other natively trained BitNet models, meanwhile, have been at smaller scales that \"may not yet match the capabilities of larger, full-precision counterparts,\" they write."

            "content": "ChatGPT users have discovered that the popular AI chatbot can serve as a reverse-location search tool. In other words, you can show ChatGPT a picture, and it can pretty reliably tell you where it was taken. The trend is inspired by the online game Geoguessr, where folks try to figure out a location from a simple web image.\n\nWe decided to put this new ChatGPT trend to the test, and the results were downright scary. Mashable tech reporters prompted ChatGPT to play a geo-guessing game and uploaded a series of photos. Even when ChatGPT identified the wrong location, it still got pretty close (such as identifying a rooftop hotel in Buffalo instead of Rochester). In other cases, it suggested specific addresses.\n\nChatGPT's new reasoning models are getting smarter\n\nThis week, OpenAI introduced its newest ChatGPT reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini, with improved visual reasoning. OpenAI also recently made its image generator available to free users. That's led to a number of ChatGPT-based viral trends. People have used it to turn their pets into humans or themselves into action figures, for instance. The reverse location trend, however, is a bit more complicated — and concerning from a privacy standpoint.\n\nThe trend started when folks online realized that ChatGPT has become proficient at guessing a location just by analyzing a photo. Ethan Mollick, a professor who researches AI, posted an example on X where ChatGPT was able to correctly guess where he was driving despite the fact that he stripped the image of location info. (Images often contain metadata that includes precise location data.)\n\nMollick noted that this ability also shows off the capabilities of agentic AI, which allows AI models to reason out answers in multiple steps and perform more complicated tasks such as web searches.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

First, we uploaded a recent photo of a flower shop taken in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. ChatGPT was able to deduce the photo was taken in Brooklyn. It incorrectly thought the image was of a specific flower shop about seven miles away from the true location.\n\nWe then uploaded a photo taken from a car on a recent trip to Japan, and ChatGPT's new o3 model was able to identify the exact location. \"Final answer:📍 Arashiyama, Kyoto, Japan, near the Togetsukyo Bridge, looking across the Katsura River.\"\n\nThe prompt... Credit: Screenshot courtesy of OpenAI ...and the correct answer. Credit: Screenshot courtesy of ChatGPT\n\nWhen we ran the same prompt with an older reasoning model, the results were much more general: \"Given the combination of mountainous terrain, the style of the guardrail, the road, and the overall setting, this looks very much like it could be Japan...The scenery is reminiscent of the areas around Kyoto or Nara, where the countryside meets historic and cultural sites.\"\n\nWe then took things a step further. We uploaded screenshots from the profile of a popular Instagram model — the type of person who would have genuine concerns about privacy and stalkers. With the latest reasoning models, ChatGPT correctly identified the general location, even suggesting specific high-rise apartments, and in one case, a specific home address.\n\nNow, to be fair, the address in question is a home popular among influencers and TV productions, but the specificity was impressive. And a bit scary. It's yet another reason to be careful about what you post online — AI can now help folks deduce where you're located.\n\nOpenAI has said ChatGPT's reverse location abilities could prove helpful, while also acknowledging privacy concerns.\n\n\"OpenAI o3 and o4-mini bring visual reasoning to ChatGPT, making it more helpful in areas like accessibility, research, or identifying locations in emergency response,\" an OpenAI spokesperson wrote in an email to Mashable. \"We’ve worked to train our models to refuse requests for private or sensitive information, added safeguards intended to prohibit the model from identifying private individuals in images, and actively monitor for and take action against abuse of our usage policies on privacy.”"

            "description": "No third-party drives here.",
            "content": "Storage and technology company Synology will require self-branded, verified drives for consumer NAS systems starting with the new 25 Plus series lineup.\n\nInitially reported by Hardwareluxx in Germany, Synology is continuing its trend of requiring users to put Synology-certified drives into system storage devices, such as NAS, which stands for network-attached storage. Photographers can use NAS to store all their vital data and access it via their network, like a personal cloud. It is a popular solution for many creatives who have a lot of photo and video files they want to protect and easily access.\n\nThis new Synology policy was first introduced in the company’s enterprise products, where reliability and consistency are of utmost importance — and worth paying extra for if need be.\n\nIt is worth noting that the requirement to use Synology-verified drives starts with the 25 Plus series products and will not carry backward to existing products. Further, customers can technically use non-verified drives in Synology’s new NAS systems, although this decision will come with consequences. Users will not be able to receive hard drive health reports, perform volume-wide duplication, see lifespan analysis of their drives, or receive automatic firmware updates, per Tom’s Hardware.\n\nAs for why Synology is making this move, the company tells PetaPixel that it will help ensure better reliability and an improved overall user experience.\n\n“With the launch of the new Synology 25 Plus series product lineup, Synology is introducing a streamlined compatibility policy designed to enhance reliability and improve user experience. Synology-branded drives will be needed for use in the newly announced Plus series, with plans to update the Product Compatibility List as additional drives can be thoroughly vetted in Synology systems,” the company says.\n\n“This decision reflects Synology’s ongoing commitment to deliver the highest levels of system stability and performance. Extensive internal testing has shown that drives that follow a rigorous validation process when paired with Synology systems are at less risk of drive failure and ongoing compatibility issues,” Synology continues.\n\n“Additionally, Synology will be introducing a carefully curated drive compatibility framework for those wanting to integrate third-party drives into their Synology systems. Users can submit drives for a comprehensive testing and documentation process. Drives that meet Synology’s stringent standards may be validated for use, offering flexibility while maintaining system integrity.\n\n“It is important to note that existing Synology products released prior to the ‘25 series will continue to support third-party drives in accordance with current compatibility guidelines, and this change does not affect J and Values Series models. Additionally, users will be able to migrate older drives from previous Synology models into the new ‘25 models, ensuring that their data is still accessible and protected.”\n\nAt its core, this move reflects Synology’s willingness to restrict its customers to fewer options in exchange for what it believes will be a more consistent, reliable, and better overall user experience with its upcoming NAS systems.\n\nHow it will impact storage costs for new customers or old ones who upgrade to a new Synology remains to be seen. Synology is itself not a drive manufacturer; its branded drives are made by other companies like Seagate and Toshiba. So the Synology drives required for 25 Plus series NAS systems are arguably already “third-party” drives, albeit ones that have been strictly tested and certified.\n\nWhenever a limit like this is instituted, there is a risk of increased costs for customers. Fewer choices rarely result in lower prices, after all. However, fewer choices in a sensitive storage ecosystem could certainly improve overall reliability and performance. That’s what Synology believes, at least.\n\nImage credits: Synology"

But it might be tricky to buy one of these tiny storage chips, as they have started selling out since the Switch 2's reveal.\n\nThis Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans\n\nThis Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans\n\nEarlier this month, Nintendo finally unveiled the Switch 2. The new console will cost $450 and will feature a bigger screen, more powerful hardware, and will have a fancy new button dedicated to chatting with friends online. The Switch 2 will also be able to play more visually impressive games, like Cyberpunk 2077, and will sport shorter loading times, too. However, to pull this off, Nintendo upgraded the Switch 2's storage and now the upcoming device requires faster MicroSD Express cards. And people are buying up so many, so quickly, that some stores are running low or completely selling out of the storage cards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs reported by Tom’s Hardware, shortly after the Switch 2's reveal on April 2, physical and online stores began seeing their stock of Express cards sell like hotcakes. Staff at one store in Japan claimed that they were selling over 330 cards ever hour after the Switch 2’s announcement.\n\nNintendo\n\nMicroSD Express card aren’t new tech. They have been around since at least 2019 and have generally been pretty easy to buy over the last few years. However, there really wasn’t a need to upgrade to the faster cards, and the high prices on them—they often cost more than twice as much—meant they had never really become popular among consumers. So this sudden wave of interest in Express cards from people planning to buy a Switch 2 has likely caught stores, factories, and suppliers off guard. That has led to shortages, delays, and places selling out entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI checked Amazon and found many Express cards out of stock. Best Buy seemed to have some, but that could change as Switch 2 pre-orders go live next week and more people start committing to upgrading.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd we likely can’t blame scalpers or resellers entirely for the shortages, as it’s reported that 80 percent of customers are just buying one card. It’s more likely that a product that had never seen mass adoption from consumers is now selling out as there wasn’t a ton of stock sitting around. And with the ongoing threat of President Trump issuing more tariffs, it might continue to be hard to get your hands on a MicroSD Express card for your Switch 2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n.\n\n"

            "content": "Hot news in the defense of Pocketpair just emerged in regards to the ongoing patent infringement dispute between the developer and Nintendo over popular Xbox Game Pass game, Palworld.\n\n\n\nThanks to the incredible investigative work of GamesFray, a platform specializing in gaming legal matters, we now have a detailed look at Pocketpair’s defenses in the Japan-specific patent infringement case, direct from the Tokyo District Court.\n\n\n\nThese findings shed light on Pocketpair’s strategy on countering Nintendo’s claims and could have significant ramifications for the gaming industry.\n\n\n\nIt's often argued that many of the patents Nintendo are going after Pocketpair for infringing are for game mechanics used in a plethora of other games, and this seems to be the exact tact that the Palworld developers are taking. We now have all the games so far named in the lawsuit, and some of them may surprise you.\n\nPocketpair’s argument involves the role of prior games\n\nTitanfall 2 is catching strays in this lawsuit (Image credit: Electronic Arts)\n\nPocketpair are challenging Nintendo’s patents by pointing to prior art — existing games and technologies that allegedly contain similar mechanics that Nintendo has not also challenged.\n\n\n\nThe argument here is that these patents should not have been granted to Nintendo in the first place, because the claimed mechanics were already in use.\n\n\n\nPocketpair references a wide range of games, including Craftopia (their own title), ARK: Survival Evolved, Rune Factory 5, and even Nintendo’s Legend of Zelda.\n\n\n\nMods like Pixelmon for Minecraft and Nukamon for Fallout 4 are also part of their defense, so even user-made mods have been listed in their defence.\n\n\n\nHere's the full list of games stated in the case, as painstakingly listed by GamesFray.\n\nIn addition to games, Pocketpair have also pointed out the Unity game engine as an example of prior art.\n\n\n\nIn the above list, Rune Factory 5, Titanfall 2 and Pikmin 3 Deluxe make it easy to see how a player character can perform an action to release a monster or a capture item (like a ball) and fire in a direction by releasing a button. Pikmin 3 Deluxe, Far Cry 5 and Tomb Raider already showed that there can be different types of throwable objects.\n\n\n\nGames like Pocket Souls, Octopath Traveler, Monster Super League, and Final Fantasy XIV already show how players can target creatures and get an idea of their chances of capturing them.\n\n\n\nPocketpair argues that combining features from these games makes Nintendo’s patents seem less unique or inventive, which is a requirement under Japanese patent law.\n\n\n\nThey also point out that Pokémon games have used different success rates for capture items for over 30 years, making this idea far from new. Hey, it's old hat now right?\n\nWhat is the Pocketpair vs Nintendo case all about?\n\nMany of the throwing mechanics have already been changed in a recent update to Palworld (Image credit: Pocketpair)\n\nNintendo alleges that Palworld infringes on three of its patents related to gameplay mechanics, particularly in areas such as capturing creatures and the seamless transitioning between gameplay modes.\n\n\n\nTo remind you of what's in question here, it's:\n\nPatent No. 7545191 - This patent, owned by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, covers a mechanic for capturing creatures by throwing an object, such as a Poké Ball, in a virtual environment. It involves defining the aiming direction based on player input and determining capture success. Nintendo claims that Palworld’s creature capture system is too similar to this patented gameplay method.\n\nThis patent, owned by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, covers a mechanic for capturing creatures by throwing an object, such as a Poké Ball, in a virtual environment. It involves defining the aiming direction based on player input and determining capture success. Nintendo claims that Palworld’s creature capture system is too similar to this patented gameplay method. Patent No. 7493117 - This patent focuses on character movement and collision, specifically in scenarios involving character interactions and pathfinding. It also addresses a mechanic where players engage in battles by launching one creature at another. Nintendo alleges that Palworld’s mechanics around creature combat infringe on this patent.\n\nThis patent focuses on character movement and collision, specifically in scenarios involving character interactions and pathfinding. It also addresses a mechanic where players engage in battles by launching one creature at another. Nintendo alleges that Palworld’s mechanics around creature combat infringe on this patent. Patent No. 7528390 - This patent describes a dynamic mounting system for characters moving across land, air, and water, allowing seamless transitions between different types of terrain. Nintendo argues that Palworld’s use of a similar system for player-controlled creatures and mounts infringes on this patent as well.\n\nDifferent genres, different mechanics at play\n\nPocketpair also argues in it's case, that Palworld does not directly infringe on Nintendo’s patents, even if they are deemed valid. So in relation to the following, these counterpoints have been made:\n\nGameplay mechanics : Pocketpair contends that Palworld doesn’t rely on the same button operations or clear distinctions between combat and non-combat modes that Nintendo’s patents describe.\n\n: Pocketpair contends that Palworld doesn’t rely on the same button operations or clear distinctions between combat and non-combat modes that Nintendo’s patents describe. Genre differences: While Nintendo’s Pokémon games are role-playing games with creature collection as a core mechanic, Palworld is primarily at heart a survival and crafting game.\n\nFor each patent in question, Pocketpair has provided a counter arguement referencing all the games listed here and how they use arguably similar mechanics.\n\n\n\nThe wider point here is that many games have inspired eachother since the dawn of video game creation, so if Nintendo are allowed to win this case, how will that impact creativity going forward?\n\nThis case will have wider ramifications outside of Palworld\n\nThis case centres on a critical issue in gaming: the balance between protecting true innovation within a developers own intellectual property, and balancing that to allow creative freedom.\n\n\n\nGame development often builds on existing ideas, combining elements from past titles to create something new. Games like Binding of Isaac and Slay the Spire walked so Balatro could run for example.\n\n\n\nI'm sure you could pick up any modern video game today and draw out many references to classics of the past.\n\n\n\nIf Nintendo’s patents are upheld, it could set a precedent that makes it harder for developers to innovate without risking legal action. While this case is ongoing in Japan only, there's also work happening behind the scenes by Nintendo to bring the case to American soil.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

Florian Mueller behind the site has provided excellent commentary on previous gaming litigation cases, including the Microsoft and Activision Blizzard acquisition.\n\nFor now, Pocketpair has taken a firm stance, challenging both the validity of Nintendo’s patents and their applicability to Palworld.\n\n\n\nBut what do you think? Are you Team Nintendo or Team Pocketpair in this case?"

Data from Steam players — where the game seems to be the most popular — backs this up, according to a LinkedIn post by Alinea Analytics analyst Rhys Elliott.\n\nWhile we won’t know official numbers, Elliott says Blue Prince sales on PlayStation and Xbox are “very low right now,” but that almost 150,000 people have played it. Elliott suspects the low sales stem from the game being available on Game Pass and PlayStation Plus.\n\nOn Steam, the game peaked at over 15,000 concurrent players and is now hovering around 13,000, according to SteamDB. Steam global achievement stats tell us that almost 20% of those players have completed the game’s main goal of reaching room 46 of the 45-room mansion.\n\nGraphic: Alinea Analytics\n\nAccording to Elliott, just over 25% of Steam players have spent 20 to 50 hours in the game since it was released just eight days ago. These are the players who have probably pushed past the opening hours, full of dead-end rooms and unsolved puzzles, and see how deep the rabbit holes go. The percentage of players who have only just touched the surface is slightly lower at 24%.\n\nSteam reviews can be pretty volatile when a game is fresh, but Blue Prince has held onto a “very positive” rating with over 2,500 reviews. Elliott points out that 57% of Blue Prince players also played Balatro, which makes sense if you think about how similar drafting rooms is to drawing cards. Both games have roguelike elements too, so it’s no surprise the same types of players are attracted to them.\n\nAll of this means that there are a lot of Blue Prince fans that could join us in trying to answer our biggest question about it: Why is there only one bathroom in that giant mansion?"

As dedicated Elder Scrolls fans, we are incredibly excited by this prospect and sincerely hope the information proves accurate. The glimpses we’ve seen look fantastic, and we eagerly anticipate the possibility of experiencing a modern, professionally developed return to Cyrodiil. Bethesda has always been supportive of community projects like ours, and we don’t see that changing anytime soon. As a PC mod, a console release is impossible for us, so the remaster presents a wonderful opportunity for console players to re-experience Oblivion, something our project could never directly provide.\n\nWe want to emphasize that there is no need for comparisons or a sense of competition between Skyblivion and a potential official remaster. Both projects can exist and thrive together, offering unique experiences for players. Skyblivion is a labor of love, built by a dedicated community for the community, offering a distinct way to revisit Oblivion within the familiar framework of the Creation Engine. Similarly, an official remaster would undoubtedly bring its own set of advancements with the full funding of a development studio. We see this not as a conflict, but as a fantastic opportunity for Elder Scrolls fans to have even more way to enjoy the classic world of Cyrodiil.\n\nWe extend our gratitude to our incredible community for their unwavering support, enthusiasm, and patience throughout our development journey. Your passion fuels our dedication. We also want to cheer on the talented game developers at Virtuos and any other teams potentially involved in bringing an official Oblivion remaster to life. We recognize the immense effort and artistry that goes into such a significant undertaking.\n\nUltimately, 2025 promises to be a remarkable year for fans of Oblivion. We are confident that players will be the true winners, having the opportunity to experience both a community-driven reimagining and a professional, modern version of this beloved game.\n\nWe look forward to sharing more about Skyblivion’s progress soon as we approach its release later this year."

            "content": "In a study, scientists used a new way of displaying color imagery to push the boundaries of human vision.\n\nScientists have devised a method to hijack the human eye, enabling it to see brand-new colors that lie beyond the scope of natural human vision.\n\nWith this technique, the researchers enabled five people to see a new color, dubbed \"olo,\" which the study participants described as a \"blue-green of unprecedented saturation.\" The researchers, some of whom participated in the experiment themselves, described their technique and the new color in a study published Friday (April 18) in the journal Science Advances .\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to provide programmable control over every photoreceptor [light-sensing cell] in the retina,\" primarily for research purposes, said co-first author James Fong , a doctoral student in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Although this has not been achieved to that level, the method we present in the current study demonstrates that a lot of the key principles are possible in practice,\" Fong told Live Science in an email.\n\nControlling the retina at this granular level could open up new ways of studying vision, the researchers said. For instance, scientists could use the system to replicate the effects of different eye diseases to better understand the vision loss they trigger. In theory, the technique could also be used to simulate full-color vision in people who are color-blind, essentially compensating for their missing or defective photoreceptors.\n\nBy using the system to introduce the brain to new visual data and patterns of retina stimulation, in theory, \"it may be possible that this [color-blind] person would learn to see the new dimension of color,\" Fong suggested.\n\nRelated: This optical illusion tricks you into seeing different colors. How does it work?\n\nJourney to Oz\n\nHuman eyes contain light-sensitive cells, called photoreceptors, which come in two forms: rods and cones. Rods enable night vision, as they respond to relatively low levels of photons, or packets of electromagnetic radiation .\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nCones take over in bright light, and they are specialized to detect specific wavelengths of visible light — namely, red, green and blue. These three types of cones are respectively named \"L,\" \"M\" and \"S,\" in reference to the long, medium and short wavelengths of the visible spectrum to which they are most sensitive.\n\nOnce cones are activated, color vision relies on the brain to interpret the activation patterns of these three types of cells across the retina. Each pattern acts like a code, with different codes unlocking different perceptions of colors and intensities of light.\n\nM cones are most sensitive to green, but technically, they respond to a whole spectrum of colors that completely overlaps with the wavelengths L and S cones react to. As such, in natural conditions, you can't activate M cones without also activating L and S cones. The scientists wondered what would happen if you could defy that rule and exclusively activate M cones.\n\nThis chart demonstrates how, in natural settings, the activation of M cones also comes with activation of S and L cones. In the new study, the researchers activated M in isolation. (Image credit: By BenRG - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7873848)\n\n\"We originally started this project specifically to study M cone stimulation,\" Fong said. \"But it quickly became clear to us that [the] required underlying technology would be broadly useful to study visual function at a new level of scale and precision.\"\n\nThey named their resulting retinal stimulation technique \"Oz,\" in homage to the green-tinted glasses that people in the Emerald City wear in the original \"Wizard of Oz\" books. The approach requires a detailed map of each user's retina. To create such a map, the researchers started by taking multiple videos of the retina and stitching them together to capture what the tissue looked like.\n\nFrom there, the L, M and S cones were labeled; the locations of these cells are unique in each person's retina, Fong noted. To reveal each cone's identity, the researchers used a technique called adaptive optics optical coherence tomography (AO-OCT), which involved shining light on the cells and measuring how they changed shape; this response differs depending on which wavelengths a cone is sensitive to.\n\nWith a detailed retinal map, the team then ran their experiments. Each participant sat in front of a display with a small square at its center, where the Oz stimulation unfolded. The stimulation targeted specific types of cones with visible-wavelength laser light, called laser microdoses. So, to switch on only M cones, the system targeted only those cells with lasers.\n\nThe scientists also used a real-time feed of the eye during the experiment, and the approach accounted for the eye's subtle motion, to ensure the lasers hit their targets.\n\nRevealing a new color\n\nStimulating only M cones revealed the color olo, whose name refers to coordinates on a 3D map of color — \"0, 1, 0.\" The \"o\" is a zero, referencing the lack of stimulation of L and S cones, while the \"l\" is a 1, indicating full stimulation of M cones. After stimulating olo in isolation, the scientists were also able to incorporate the color into images and videos viewed by the participants.\n\nOne way to imagine olo is to think of the light from a green laser pointer and then turn up the saturation. In comparison with olo, monochromatic laser light looks \"pale,\" some of the participants said. \"It is very foreign to me to imagine how something else could be saturated enough to where the laser starts looking pale in comparison,\" Fong said.\n\nAlthough Oz can already push the boundaries of human vision, it does have some limitations in its current setup.\n\nFor instance, participants cannot look directly at the Oz display, Fong noted, because the cones at the very center of the retina are very small, making it difficult to localize the laser light. Because of this, people in the study viewed Oz with their peripheral vision by looking at a fixed point slightly away from the square.\n\nEventually, Oz could potentially be applied on the fovea — the central part of the retina that enables super-sharp vision — but \"it will be a significant challenge in practice,\" Fong said.\n\nAnother limitation is that, currently, users must fix their gaze in one spot to use Oz, because the scientists mapped only a small portion of the retina containing thousands of cones, as a proof of concept. Allowing people to shift their gaze freely would introduce \"substantial technical challenges,\" the authors wrote in their paper. That's because more of the retina would need to be mapped and the method for delivering microdoses would need to be extraordinarily precise in tracking eye movement.\n\nThe scientists are now exploring the idea of using Oz to study and treat color blindness, as well as to stimulate the experience of having a fourth type of cone cell. This occurs naturally in some people and results in a rare ability called tetrachromacy , which boosts their sensitivity to color. The team is also using Oz to model various eye diseases.\n\nOutside of scientific research, Oz could theoretically be used for everyday color displays, like those in your television or phone screen — but that application seems very unlikely, Fong said.\n\n\"Our current method depends on highly specialized lasers and optics that are definitely not coming to smartphones or TVs any time soon,\" he said. So, for now, olo will remain a rare color seen by only a few."

You get Pixel 9 specs, a good camera experience, great battery life, and lots of AI thanks to Google Gemini, which is miles ahead of Apple Intelligence.\n\nGoogle’s Pixel 9a vs. iPhone 16e comparison page. Image source: Google\n\nThe last thing Google should do is draw attention to the iPhone 16e by publishing a Pixel 9a comparison on its site. If you’ve got the customer here, and they’re almost ready to buy new hardware, don’t show them the competition. What if they change their mind and go for the iPhone 16e instead?\n\nGoogle’s comparison page wants to answer the question: Is the Pixel 9a “the best budget phone out there?”\n\nThe answer Google is going for is “yes, the Pixel 9a is the best budget phone,” though Google isn’t exactly impartial:\n\nObviously, we’re big Pixel fans. So let’s step away from the subjective stuff – like how the Pixel 9a color choices are way more fun and the design is cooler – and look at the facts.\n\nObviously, Google then puts up a specs comparison that will mostly benefit the Android phone. That’s how these specs comparisons have gone for years. Android vendors usually win them because they’ve been beefing up the specs at a much faster pace than Apple.\n\nObviously, the specs detail that matters the most, the chips that power the two phones, is absent. The iPhone 16e’s A18 chip will wipe the floor with Google’s Tensor G4.\n\nObviously, Google also uses the “7 years of security and OS updates with Pixel Drops” category to tell you the Pixel 9a is better. First of all, iPhones don’t get Pixel Drops. Second, that G4 chip will probably have a much tougher time dealing with those Android updates the further we go. Meanwhile, Apple’s iPhone 16e should have no problem running several iOS iterations.\n\nObviously, Apple’s AI sucks. There’s no question about it. This is Google’s main advantage, and something the comparison is correct to point out. Gemini is simply superior to Apple Intelligence, and I say that as a longtime iPhone owner disappointed in how Apple handled its first year of AI.\n\nObviously, as a longtime iPhone user, I’d recommend the iPhone 16e over the Pixel 9a time and again to anyone who isn’t loyal to a smartphone brand or mobile operating system. That’s not to say the Pixel 9a is a bad phone. I’d recommend it over other mid-range phones to Android users.\n\nWhat I’m getting at is that this comparison page should not exist on Google’s page. Not unless Google puts up similar comparisons with other mid-range Android phones that compete against the Pixel 9a. Samsung has a few of those, as does Nothing and virtually every Android vendor under the sun. Otherwise, it just goes to show how afraid Google is of Apple when it shouldn’t be.\n\nPixel phones are good, mature devices. Google can sell them without comparing them to iPhones. Obviously."

            "description": "Ripples of Undeath saw a massive price increase this past week thanks to its incredible synergy with Teval, the Balanced Scale.",
            "content": "Honestly, I’m surprised it took Ripples of Death this long to start showing signs of a price spike. The card isn’t quite as good as it’s green counterpart, but anything that can be compared to Sylvan Library is incredibly efficent as far as Commander goes.\n\nThe card is finally beginning to see recognition because it has tons of synergy with the new Sultai Commander cards releasing alongside Tarkir: Dragonstorm. Anything that moves cards in and out of the graveyard is valuable, and Ripples of Death creates tons of value while furthering your gameplan.\n\nRipples of Undeath\n\nRipples of Undeath, essentially, offers an extra draw and some card selection every turn. For two mana, this is a massive steal. The singular mana isn’t a big deal a lot of the time, and Commander players have more than enough life to pay to get cards back from the graveyard.\n\nInstead of putting the cards back on top your deck like Sylvan Library, Ripples of Undeath mills them and pulls one out of the grave. Graveyard Commander deck synergies aside, this is even more powerful with the various tools from the Sultai Arisen precon. That Commander deck specifically cares about you moving cards out of your graveyard.\n\nUsing Teval, Balanced Scale and Teval’s Judgment alongside Ripples of Undeath creates a ton of value. Teval will make Zombie Druids as long as you move a card to your hand with Ripples of Undeath, while Teval’s Judgment can draw cards, create treasures, or create more creature tokens.\n\nSultai Arisen aside, Teval, the Balanced Scale is the second most popular Commander this month, and the most popular this week. Tons of players are also building Teval from scratch, and Ripples of Undeath’s synergy with the Commander is undeniable.\n\nThis is enough reason for Ripples of Undeath to see a significant price spike. The card is already fantastic in any black Commander deck, but the card functions as the perfect upgrade for the Sultai Arisen precon.\n\nThe Spike\n\nRipples of Undeath has been a very popular since January. Over the past three months, Ripples of Undeath has never sold less than 38 copies per three days. That’s an obscene amount of cardboard.\n\nSo, despite lots of demand, why has it taken so long for Ripples of Undeath to spike? It appears that demand has finally outweighed supply. Only 11 listings of the traditional Ripples of Undeath are available on TCGplayer, while only eight extended arts are currently listed. Two prerelease foils round off only 21 copies of Ripples of Undeath across the platform.\n\nDespite this immense popularity, Ripples of Undeath only started spiking near the end of March. Spiking from $4 to $13.50, Ripples has experienced a 237.5% price spike so far. The card is still selling strong daily as of the writing of this article, so there’s a decent chance that this spike isn’t over yet. A majority of the currently available traditional variant Ripples of Undeath are over $20.\n\nAll of Ripples of Undeath’s other variants have a noticable premium over the traditional one. The Extended art Ripples of Undeath are going for $15-20 for the nonfoil variant, and $25+ for the foil one. Current asking prices for the card start at $35 at the time of writing.\n\nThis Could Get More Expensive\n\nWhile Ripples of Undeath has additional synergies with the current Commander craze, it’s just a good Magic card and boasts an effect that should probably retail for more than $4. The card is likely to retain some value from this spike as a result, but it’s very likely that Ripples of Undeath will settle at a price below where this spike ends.\n\nRipples of Undeath won’t always have additional synergies with the Commander flavor of the month, but any black deck that uses the graveyard will at least consider using this card. Even black decks that don’t care about milling may still want this card solely due to the card selection it grants.\n\nSo, while we expect Ripples of Undeath to settle a bit, we wouldn’t be surprised if it never quite got back down to where it was before this spike. Sylvan Library is a Commander all-star for a reason and, while Ripples of Undeath isn’t quite as good as its source material, it is very comparable."

Both games feature retouched graphics, enhanced audio, new English localizations, and gameplay tweaks like optional battle speed increases to make the classic RPGs more approachable. The Amazon-exclusive physical editions have reversible cover art featuring both Lunar and Lunar 2 by series illustrator and anime artist Toshiyuki Kubooka. A digital version of the collection is also available for consoles and PC via Steam. See at Amazon\n\nThis collection sounds like an excellent way to experience two of the most important RPGs from the 16-bit and 32-bit console eras. The original Lunar: Silver Star Story is considered a landmark title in the Japanese RPG lineage and was one of the first console RPGs to feature voice acting, animated cutscenes, and CD-quality music thanks to its original platform, the Sega CD. It was later remade for PS1 and Sega Saturn as Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete, which is the version included in the Lunar Remastered Collection. Its sequel, Lunar 2: Eternal Blue, also launched on PS1 and Saturn and built upon the gameplay and story presentation of the first game, featuring even more voiced dialogue and a larger cast.\n\nVoice acting, cutscenes, and high-quality soundtracks are now common elements of video games, they were groundbreaking at the time--though the voice performances are now notorious for their uneven quality. However, the new Remastered Collection includes all-new English voice acting for both games--though the scripts for both remasters are based on the original localizations. Lunar Remastered Collection also includes the option to play with Japanese voice acting, and you can also swap between the new enhanced visuals or the PS1 visuals for both games."

As a result, when Disney acknowledges the series, even in small ways, it can feel significant, like a reminder that the game is still coming and in active development over at Square. That’s why Kingdom Hearts fans are having a moment over a 10-hour-long lo-fi music video Disney uploaded to its YouTube channel.\n\nWhat Is Dragonsplague?

Dragon’s Dogma 2’s Devastating Contagion Explained\n\n2025 is the 30th anniversary of A Goofy Movie. If you’ve never seen it, the movie is an excellent father-son romp starring Goofy and his son Max, and it also has some incredible musical bangers. Though the movie wasn’t a huge success at the box office, it managed to gain a cult following after it was released on VHS. To celebrate the anniversary, Disney has released a documentary on the making of the movie, Not Just A Goof, on Disney+, and also put out a lo-fi ambiance video of Max studying that you can listen to while you study or work. I’ve got it open in my browser now, and maybe there is something to these videos. This is a vibe.\n\nDisney\n\nWhile the comments are turned off on the video itself, if you look around social media platforms like TikTok and X (formerly Twitter), you’ll find eagle-eyed Kingdom Hearts fans yapping about a few things on and around Max’s desk. The mug full of pencils has two stickers on it that appear to be the sea-salt ice cream and paopu fruit, two pieces of iconography from the Kingdom Hearts series. On the wall next to it, there appears to be an image of Twilight Town, a major location in the RPGs. While Goofy has been a mainstay in the Kingdom Hearts series for over 20 years, Max has never made an appearance in the games after all this time. Does he not exist in the Kingdom Hearts universe? Goofy’s never mentioned him, at least. But either way, it looks like he’s a fan of his dad’s multiverse adventures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatever the case, Kingdom Hearts fans are wondering if this is just a cute nod to the series or if it could be a sign that Max will finally make his debut in the series in Kingdom Hearts IV.

I pulled double-duty on both This Week in... columns, not unlike that time an ongoing story in Kamen Rider Gaim was interrupted for a Kikaider plug. We were talking about porn! It was a fascinating conversation, and I hope we didn't give our dear editor too many grey hairs over it all. You may have heard over on my Bluesky that I rolled credits on Xenoblade Chronicles 3 . I hope you'll forgive me for not giving my thoughts yet—I don't think I'll \"really\" be done with it until I beat Future Connected . Bear with me. With any luck, I'll get to Xenoblade Chronicles X before summer hits.\n\n...But I must say, that was a damn fine ending.\n\nThis is...\n\nSony Raises PlayStation 5 Prices Abroad\n\nThe discourse on the Switch 2 has gone entirely out of control. While the US$450 price is on the higher-end of what people are willing to expect, the US$80 price tag on certain Switch 2 titles has led to the kind of outrage where misinformation absolutely festers , from some claims that some Switch 2 games would cost US$90 (no idea where that one comes from, maybe folks were confusing the European prices?) to sabers being rattled at the Game Key cards (even though other publishers are adopting similar methods). That the Japanese Switch 2 is priced at about US$330 is now cited as evidence that Nintendo is \"being greedy,\" never mind that the yen is still extremely weak at the moment. It's led to a whole discourse that, throughout a weekend, seemed to lose sight of any nuance outside of \"DROP THE PRICE,\" which I'm sure is cathartic to spam in a chat. Not sure what it'll do in the long run, though. With all the discourse over the Switch 2's price, the smart thing for Sony and Microsoft would be to sit back on their laurels and do nothing. Decreasing the price on the PS5 might even make it more appealing than a Switch 2—\n\n—or, they can raise the price of the PS5. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSony announced the price hike on their official blog this Sunday , before the work week even had a chance to start. The raise applies to PS5s sold in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, with prices of €499, $829.95, and $949.95, respectively. If it sounds silly to you, don't worry—it does to me, too. But also: if you bought the digital version, the separate disk trays have the same price. Yay...?\n\nThe educated guess as to the reasoning behind the price hike is simple: a significant portion of the gaming industry's sales is based in the United States. The gaming industry is facing losses courtesy of the tariffs President Trump has imposed on video game consoles. Sony is looking to make up for lost profits through sales in other regions. Again, as I said, this does seem silly, especially since the PlayStation 5 is a five-year-old console . At this point, most people would be thinking about what a possible PlayStation 6 might be like. With the consternation over the $450 Switch 2, a real slam-dunk would've been selling a PS5 at a lower price. Sure, keep the PS5 Pro at eye-gouging prices, if you have to (those graphical updates are minimal anyway). But a PS5 at $400, while Nintendo sells a $450 console, is some kind of competition. As the joke goes, the PS5 \"has no games.\" That's bullcrap, by the way— Sony has a wealth of older titles on their virtual storefront that are more than worth the price, like the Dark Cloud games or Valkyrie Profile . But Sony only seems to trot those games out as cameos for Astro Bot .\n\nConsoles were always going to get more expensive in the wake of the tariffs. I know people who were excited at the notion of snubbing the Switch 2 by just buying other consoles—or just making a PC. But of course, the same tariffs and economic factors that led to a Switch 2 price hike mean that everything else will also become more expensive. I didn't expect Sony to come out and up-sell their console, especially not in regions where their consoles are already priced as luxury goods. It needs to be said that Sony didn't have to do this, especially not on hardware that's this old or is already struggling with its value proposition. This is a fine case of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nA lot of discussion is about how gaming is being priced out of the hands of many. I think the sad truth is that this was already happening; I hear so many people insisting that you don't \"need\" to spend four figures on components for a decent gaming rig, only for the latest triple-A game to have been made with the latest GPU's in mind, so you probably want the top-of-the-line chips if you want Monster Hunter Wilds to run correctly. And the PS5 was already not cheap; as detailed in a column from a few months ago, the PS5 Pro already retails for $1400 in New Zealand—and it not only doesn't include a physical disk drive, it doesn't even include a godforsaken stand . There's a reason so many people from Europe or Canada looked at Americans panicking over $80 games—they've been paying that much for games for ages . Add to that people who in this day and age live paycheck-to-paycheck—or worse, are homeless (yes, homeless people like games too).\n\nI don't know how much a $450 Nintendo Switch will cost when it finally launches this summer, but even at the European rate of €469.99, it's still a lot less than a PS5...\n\nMarvel vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Gets An Update...?\n\nTekken 8 recent \"Defensive Patch\" might have players up in arms, but CAPCOM throws its hat into the ring with surprising updates with... a patch for Marvel vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics . This is wild and surprising, especially since it's a patch for several old games. It's not often that older collections like these get this kind of TLC, especially considering the extensiveness of the patches...\n\nThe patch comes with new art for the art gallery, illustrated by beloved fighting game artist Shinkiro. Shinkiro is regarded as a legend in the space of fighting game art, so this is a neat bit of fan service. The patch also includes new remixed songs for Captain America, Captain Commando, Cyclops, and my boy Jin Saotome. (This is the closest we'll get to a new Cyberbots game...)\n\nPlayers can also look forward to many quality-of-life updates that will make fighting game aficionados happy. First, you can press and hold a button to open the menu mid-fight. You can also reset the game straight from the menu, making things a lot easier when you're trying to set up fights. There is now an offline Versus mode for every game in the collection, making tournament play a snap. If you're playing Marvel vs. CAPCOM 2 , the game now includes options for improved resolutions to improve the old 3D visuals in the backgrounds.\n\nThe real treat that has old-school pugilists thrilled is the option to access X-Men vs. Street Fighter 's various builds (960910, 961004, and 961023). This is big! Many of the older ports for X-Men vs. Street Fighter only handled the latest version of the game (961023). While it's not the worst version of the game, the earlier builds are preferred by many players because it is a lot easier to pull off tech. Players can choose whichever version they want to play. This is a great move for video game archiving, to say nothing of the options it gives people trying to set up local tournaments.\n\nMost importantly, it's an excellent show of faith from CAPCOM . It's not very common to see a collection get this extensive of a patch, let alone with all of the extra goodies (the artwork and music, specifically). They're committed to making these collections as complete as possible. This is a good show and inspiring to hear regarding CAPCOM 's other collections.\n\nWell that is the nail in the coffin. Now I get to go to bed angry... They added the EO note today by the way. How crazy that they running this off an Arcade Rom, but EO is ranked... I just can't right now@JWonggg @maximilian_ pic.twitter.com/2V6t2NWsn6 — Silentscope88 (@silentscope88) April 16, 2025\n\nA least it would, until further updates came out later in the week. Remember how X-Men vs. Street Fighter had several versions? Well, so does CAPCOM vs. SNK 2 in the CAPCOM Fighting Collection 2 set. Normally, this isn't an issue: the main version of the game that you play is the arcade version. The problem originates from the online ranked mode; for some reason, it runs on the later \"Easy Operation\" version of CAPCOM vs. SNK 2 . Much like with X-Men vs. Street Fighter , the \"EO\" version, as it's known, is fairly maligned among the fighting game community. Long story short, the EO version doesn't feature an exploit known as \"roll cancelling,\" which makes the game less enjoyable for many seasoned pros. More puzzling is that the collection defaults to this version of CAPCOM vs. SNK 2 . A lot of figures in the fighting game community are raising awareness of the issue, so hopefully CAPCOM can offer some extra options down the line for folks who don't want to play the EO version. I encourage folks to respectfully throw their hat into the ring and let CAPCOM know of their desire for better options, if they're so inclined.\n\nMagical Princess Lines Up To Fill Void Left by Princess Maker\n\nThroughout this column, we've touched on several major video games that have massively influenced Japanese gaming but get almost no lip service in the United States—think Tokimeki Memorial or Angelique . Part of the issue is that these games have never been made available in the United States for American fans to enjoy—but it looks like we'll have an alternative for one famous formative title!\n\nMagical Princess comes to us from Neotro Inc. and Magi Inc. Here, you play as a widower raising a daughter on your own, starting from childhood up to her graduation from magic school. Of course, you have tons of choices to make in raising her: you can diligently encourage her to focus on her studies, raising her to be a renowned spellcaster; or you can encourage her to prowl the streets at night, falling in with a colorful band of motorcyclists. Magical Princess boasts about 50 endings, all hinging on the myriad paths your daughter's life can take, from the beloved local baker to the infamous Demon Queen. Along the way, you can introduce your daughter to a wealth of characters for her to befriend or even fall in love with—as well as deck her out in any number of luxurious outfits. Also, your daughter is voiced by actress Sayumi Suzushiro , whom you might recognize as Nijika Ichiji from Bocchi the Rock! .\n\nImage via vocal.media © Studio Gainax\n\nIf this set-up sounds familiar, it's because it's very heavily inspired by the Princess Maker games; a series of simulation games produced by Studio Gainax (yes, the home of Neon Genesis Evangelion and Hanamaru Kindergarten ). The Princess Maker games were huge in their day, and their influences run pretty deep through the gaming industry. I don't have any hard proof of this. Still, I'm pretty sure the Princess Maker games and their emphasis on stat growth-based rearing were a major influence on the original Atelier Marie —which kickstarted the entirety of the Atelier series. The games were just a novel approach towards simulation games: a single parent (nominally a father) given a daughter by a god in the hopes that you'll raise her to be a wise, charitable adult. You can send your daughter to school and have her earn some money working jobs around town, while also sending her off on action-RPG-esque adventures around the world where she fights monsters. The options are extensive, including allowing for your daughter's weight or morality. Once again, your daughter could reach all kinds of goals, such as becoming a writer, a mason, a royal concubine, or an evil goddess! You could also marry your daughter, and the game will look at you sideways for it.\n\nPrincess Maker has a rather esteemed background to it, but the games have all but vanished after Princess Maker 5 in 2007. Gainax made an anime based on the Princess Maker games, Petite Princess Yucie , but that didn't budge the needle much. Princess Maker 2 , by and large the most popular game in the series, got a remaster last year in the form of Princess Maker 2 Regeneration , out on Steam , PlayStation 4, 5, and Nintendo Switch. Heads-up, it's a bit rough, even if it features completely new artwork from the original artist, Takami Akai .\n\nWhich is where Magical Princess comes in. With its 50 endings and myriad decisions in raising your daughter, it's hoped that Magical Princess will do right by Princess Maker 's legacy. It doesn't have a release date yet, but it has a Steam page where you can follow for further updates.\n\nChainsaw Man Director Working On Survival-Horror Game—in Roblox\n\nI don't know what to tell you. Sometimes the news writes itself. If I wanted to fake a news story, I'd do something like, \"New SaGa Game To Feature Monster Designed By Toshio Maeda \" or \" Nobuo Uematsu Reunites With Deep Purple's Ian Gillan For New Song Featured in Final Fantasy XIV Expansion.\" And make no mistake, those are all deep cuts that would blow anyone's mind, but they still feel like they come up short next to this.\n\nRyū Nakayama , better known as the director of MAPPA 's Chainsaw Man adaptation, apparently decided to go into game design. Hence his new project, The Inn : a survival-horror rogue-like where you navigate a randomly-generated haunted inn while evading all manner of ghosts and ghoulies. It's set to feature some big-name voice acting talent, including Asami Seto and Megumi Han . Oh, and it's being made in freaking Roblox .\n\n－ The Inn Trailer －\n\n\n\nFrom the director of Chainsaw Man, Ryu Nakayama @r_nkym_, step into the shadows of a haunted Japanese inn with this new #Roblox roguelite horror game! Coming soon ⛩️ #robloxdev pic.twitter.com/TcB5mgqiFH — The Inn - Roblox (@TheInnRoblox) April 9, 2025\n\nThe reasoning behind the decision to make this game in Roblox evades me; Nakayama himself acknowledges that Roblox is a lot more popular in the United States than it is in Japan. Still, he also voices his desire to give it \"a strong Japanese feel\" (according to Google Translate). Maybe he figured it'd be the easiest way to get the attention of a lot of American fans?\n\nFor what it's worth, The Inn looks rather unrecognizable as a Roblox game; the level seems quite well-designed, and the graphics are somewhat comparable to Fatal Frame . So we certainly can't fault Nakayama and his colleagues at Studio Mayflower for their attention to detail and passion! Currently, there's no word on a release date; Nakayama promises more information soon.\n\nLet's wrap up with some quick tidbits\n\nAo Oni: The Horror of Blueberry Onsen , a re-imagining of the original Ao Oni title, has a Switch release dated for this April 25th. Look forward to Ao Oni with co-op!\n\nThe wait for Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road might finally be at an end! The game has been given an August 21 release date, along with news of releases on the Xbox Series X|S and the Switch 2. Conversely, the iOS and Android versions seem to have been cancelled. Look forward to it on the PS4, PS5, Steam , and Nintendo Switch!\n\nVampire Survivors has another wild crossover set up—and it's with SaGa: Emerald Beyond ! (As it turns out, one of the guys from poncle is a huge fan of SaGa .) The update includes 12 new characters, 16 new weapons, new mechanics for controlling multiple characters, and nine new songs! The pack is completely free for anyone who owns a copy of Vampire Survivor .\n\nThat'll do it for this week, I think. I hope folks enjoyed a double-dose of That Bitch™ throughout this week. I think I'll keep it to a once-in-a-blue-moon thing. I deeply enjoyed my time with This Week in Anime , and the guys there are always a blast to work with, but two columns a week is a lot.

Nintendo originally announced the bundle's limited availability during the Switch 2 Direct earlier this month, but with preorder delays and controversy around game prices, this key detail has flown a bit under the radar.\n\nNintendo hasn't announced a firm cutoff date for the launch bundle, but the Fall 2025 stopping point for manufacturing could mean the bundle won't be on store shelves this holiday season. Granted, it's very possible that it will be a challenge to find the Switch 2, bundle or not, on store shelves in the US this year. Stock availability concerns have only increased in recent weeks due to the Trump administration's new tariffs.\n\nOutside of reconfirming the limited availability for the bundle, Nintendo's 15-minute Mario Kart World livestream stayed clear of the Switch 2 console itself. Nintendo unveiled several exciting details about Mario Kart World, including the return of Battle Mode and an in-depth look at the new costume and meal systems. On April 18, we did learn that Switch 2 preorders will begin on April 24 in the US.\n\nMario Kart World launches exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, the same day as the console."

But for the Linux gaming performance tests we were waiting on a new supported driver release, which happened to be on launch day with the NVIDIA 575.51.02 Linux beta. Now that the gaming-ready Linux driver is available for the GeForce RTX 5060 series, here are some initial benchmarks of the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB up against other NVIDIA GeForce and AMD Radeon graphics cards using the newly-released Ubuntu 25.04.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti began shipping on Wednesday with the 16GB variant slated for a $429 USD starting price. Now two days later, many of the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB listings at major Internet retails are out-of-stock. For those that I were able to find in-stock as of writing on Friday, there were some at $480 USD but most of the listings with availability still were in the $499~549 range. Availability of the 8GB RTX 5060 Ti seems to be even tighter or more limited in general with most gamers in 2025 being much better off going for the 16GB version.\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti as a reminder has 4608 CUDA cores, 16GB of GDDR7 video memory with a 128-bit memory interface, 2.41GHz base clock, and 2.57GHz boost clock. The GeForce RTX 5060 series carries all the common NVIDIA Blackwell GPU features like DLSS 4 support, latest NVENC and NVDEC blocks, PCI Express Gen 5.0 connectivity, and DisplayPort 2.1b support.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 5060 Ti has a 180 Watt graphics power rating and requires a single PCI Express 8-pin power connection or PCIe Gen 5 cable depending upon the AIB model. As mentioned in the prior compute tests, NVIDIA kindly supplied a PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB model for this launch-day testing on Phoronix."

But its next big update, Wrath of the Ancients, is the game’s largest expansion. It is set to add new quests, places to explore, ships, items, and more to the game. Originally, as announced earlier this month, the plan was to sell this expansion for $30. However, due to so many things “getting more expensive” these days, the developers have decided to knock $5 off the price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“With events happening in the world, it seems like everything is getting more expensive and there’s a lot of uncertainty in general,” said Everspace 2 developer Rockfish Games in a Steam post on April 16. “You feel it, we feel it, and all those marketing emails we’ve all been hammered with talking about prices going up certainly don’t help. Let’s change that!”\n\nRockfish Games\n\nRockfish explained that after getting together to chat and “reassess” things, the team has decided to lower the price of Wrath of the Ancients from $30 to $25. In the Steam post announcing this price change, the devs made it clear that nothing is being cut from the DLC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was also announced that a previously released DLC, Titans, was getting a price drop, too. Titans launched at $15 but now costs $12. The team says it will have a new artbook and soundtrack available for players who had already set aside the $30 and now might have an extra $5 to spare. However, the team knows that for many people, that money is likely going to be spent elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If that fiver means more ramen in your pantry, we get and respect that,” said the studio. “Do your part by spreading the word about Everspace 2: Wrath of the Ancients and give us a positive review if you like what you’ve played. It helps!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust this week we saw Sony raise the price of PS Plus and PS5 consoles in multiple countries. Nintendo is charging $80 for a single video game. And grocery prices in many cities are going up and up as Trump’s tariffs continue to cause chaos across the global market.\n\nEverspace 2: Wrath of the Ancients launches on consoles and PC on May 12.\n\n.\n\n"

            "description": "The debut game from Secret Door, a new studio with several former Blizzard developers, aims to adapt tabletop RPG mechanics into a co-op digital game experience",
            "content": "The “digital board game” has long been an intriguing proposition. Tabletop has always had an influence on its digital cousin, but the reverse has happened just as often. Sunderfolk is the latest evolution in that effort. It’s a video game meant to evoke the feeling of an evolving tabletop role-playing campaign, melding the flexibility of a digital space with the presentation and thought processes of an in-person game night. And somehow, Sunderfolk actually pulls it off.\n\nSunderfolk was made by a number of former Blizzard developers at Secret Door, under the rapidly growing publisher Dreamhaven. The idea is to, essentially, create a tabletop game night in a virtual landscape. Everything operates through not just a single screen, but multiple devices. You’ll need one big screen, playing Sunderfolk from a PC or console, but gameplay is handled through smartphones rather than controllers.\n\nOpening Sunderfolk on Steam, for example, pulls up a QR code for players to scan, leading them to the Sunderfolk player app. From there, it’s fairly easy to scan the code and join. It’s not quite as simple as the browser-driven Jackbox, but it’s easy enough, and this system deftly avoids hassles like codes or tricky sign-ins. Scan a code, and you’ve got a seat in the game.\n\nPhoto: Secret Door/Dreamhaven\n\nFrom there, the players can choose from several animal warriors to play as, from the towering Berserker (Bear-serker?) to the bat Bard or horned Ranger. The character designs are fantastic, bringing to mind the likes of Redwall, and their archetypes lay out a fairly legible game plan for whoever you pick. The bear likes to battle, the Pyromancer creates fire, etc. But alongside picking your character, you also get to create a name, the first of many times that Secret Door lets players dip their quill and ink over pieces of Sunderfolk.\n\nOver the course of a week, I played through roughly half of Sunderfolk’s campaign in a fairly stable trio. (While Sunderfolk makes it easy to run a digital game night, you’ll still have to navigate the human problem of organizing around myriad schedules and conflicts, the archenemy of all social gatherings.) Throughout our campaign, we each got prompts on our own devices to tinker with the world of Sunderfolk. In one mission, I got to change the name of Shrines, a somewhat frequent bastion of healing amid the chaos of battle. I called it a Butt. Another player in our group labelled an enemy class “Zoomers,” and it became so ubiquitous that I cannot remember what the original class was called.\n\nWhile you do get notified when someone has created a name, it can still lead to funny moments of opening the Tavern and seeing someone has put Baja Blast on the menu, or that the Oracle’s boat has been dubbed Rocinante. It’s not just naming, though; Sunderfolk also feeds bits of lore and world-building to you through the second screen in your palm, whether that’s a helpful hint or some flavor text to amplify the world you’re in.\n\nImage: Secret Door/Dreamhaven via Polygon\n\nInterplay between the “main” screen and the second screen works smoothly and with very few hitches. When you’re in town between quests, characters can go off and engage in conversation with townsfolk, building up relationships and making dialogue choices. These all happen on each individual phone, giving everyone their own little respite. Downtime is metered by what your group wants to do, and on the main screen, character icons jump all around as each person builds up their own side stories. The dialogue tools caught me by surprise too, as characters remembered choices I’d made about my backstory or even romantic interests and responded in kind.\n\nOnce everyone’s geared up and ready to roll out, you head to the gates and vote to select a mission. In practice, battles play out like one would expect a tabletop role-playing game to play out. It’s turn- and grid-based, and each character has a lineup of skills to use that gradually grows over time. My Berserker was a potent frontliner for the team, comfortable with charging into the fray, throwing enemies around, taunting and drawing aggro, and swinging in wide arcs. Our Bard played off this, opting to manipulate positioning, and even moving me around a bit to help set me up for objectives or holding a chokepoint.\n\nControls for combat are fairly remarkable in their own right. Rather than use a smaller version of the board, the “main screen” acts as the pseudo-tabletop for battles, and players can use their mobile devices to move a cursor around like a mouse. It was surprisingly intuitive and accurate, and aside from a few mis-taps (some of which I will ascribe to user error), the tech works very well. I also love having tabs where I can pull up my abilities, other players’ abilities, and even monster and environmental info, all as the fight is playing out on the main screen. It cuts down on clutter but also gives you all the information you might want from a manual or book right there in your mobile phone.\n\nPhoto: Secret Door/Dreamhaven\n\nThe maps quickly get inventive and interesting, too. Different obstacles and hazards start to litter the field, and Secret Door gets creative with some of the scenarios. I liked how certain missions felt like really solid, novel encounters that a creative DM might invent. A standout for me was a mission where we had to get the “mine carts,” which were giant beetles, online again. Each turn, between our squad’s and the enemies’, the beetles would surge forward on their tracks, slamming everything in their path. Pulling enemies onto the tracks and locking them in place to get run over by beetles never got old.\n\nWhile there are numerous ways to simply move and do damage, more often than not, Sunderfolk has interesting ability interactions that play with positioning, hazards, and map control as much as they deal with raw numbers. Characters like the Ranger or Bard can create traps for the enemy, while the Berserker can displace and throw foes. Putting bad guys in a bottomless pit is always entertaining, and even when the plan is just to do damage, there are usually a few extra decisions to make that had our group planning and counting tiles. Add on Ultimates, which are powerful abilities with a team-wide cooldown, and we were frequently encouraged to communicate, discuss, and work together. Though we each still found opportunities to sneak away from the fight for a little bit of gold to fill our personal coffers, of course.\n\nRather than rolling dice, every player has a deck of Fate Cards, which they draw whenever they use an ability. These fall into three categories: Blue (positive), Black (neutral), and Red (negative). So if I went to damage an enemy with an attack that normally deals 4 damage, drawing a Blue card might bump that up to 6, or a Red card could drop it to a measly 2 damage.\n\nOver time, players build up their Fate deck, affording tons of options for swapping them around and specializing. While you take a 10-card deck into battle — 3 Blue, 3 Red, 4 Black — you can add many, many more to your collection, adding a little deck-builder twist. While a “+2” can be powerful, a “+1 and add 1 Strength” makes for a compelling replacement.\n\nMy Berserker finally “clicked” for me when I realized his newest weapon, a hammer made of bone, activated its weakening powers whenever I drew an especially low Fate card. Normally, this would be a tough exchange to offset. But as our crew spent money upgrading the town back home, visiting the Oracle for more Fate card options, and leveling up, I started getting Red cards with interesting side effects. One might be a -2, but it would also Heal or Shield me for 2 pips, or deal 2 damage to every enemy around me. Now, I had a build that could turn those drawbacks into fuel for my tanky bear’s frontline capabilities.\n\nImage: Secret Door/Dreamhaven via Polygon\n\nThese little touches all make the digital aspect of Sunderfolk incredibly appealing. I was regularly taken aback by how easy it was to do a mission, have a tight 10-to-20-minute combat encounter, and then have a quick stretch and social break before the next one. Sunderfolk finds a natural cadence in its balance of uptime and downtime. Venture forth to quest, fight, and win; return home to spend hard-won resources on buying new trinkets, building relationships, and upgrading town facets. There’s an even balance of collaborative combat and solo town time that’s empowered by the second-screen structure.\n\nSunderfolk’s strengths also mean it is a bit more of a multiplayer-focused endeavor. While you absolutely can play solo — I booted it up myself and verified as much — the appeal isn’t quite the same. That natural cadence and feeling of collaboration, of sitting around a digital table and planning out each turn, swaps over to feeling busy and a little tedious when you’re doing it alone. Even in games where we had an absent player and I needed to pilot two characters rather than one, I could feel the experience start to trudge through molasses.\n\nI also wish some of the “catch-up” options were a bit more lenient. We had a late joiner to our trio, which meant adding another character to our roster. But while they got to level up and match our overt power level, they missed out on some of the end-of-act goodies and mission-to-mission loot we had accrued over time, putting their Ranger on the back foot compared to our war-weary squad.\n\nImage: Secret Door/Dreamhaven via Polygon\n\nFrom the jump, Sunderfolk is gunning to be your next game night, and it certainly can fill that role. My crew has been talking about seeing the campaign all the way through together, not out of obligation, but from genuine interest in wanting to see our characters through to the end. The story is fine, though it’s bolstered significantly by actress Anjali Bhimani playing the GM role, which includes her voicing every character. It’s a smart choice that lends Sunderfolk even more of that tabletop feel, much like Amelia Tyler’s narrator in Baldur’s Gate 3.\n\nSunderfolk captures the feeling of cracking open a premade box, a module designed for your players, meant to be explored in discrete chunks over days, weeks, or even months. There’s enough here for everyone to find a character they gel with, dig into their deck and skills, and create a memorable journey for themselves and, on a larger scale, the group. It’s already a compelling concept, just as an easy co-op game for a Discord group to make part of their rotation.\n\nFactor in the second-screen capabilities, though, and it’s clear Secret Door is onto something. This is a form factor that could really click, if handled well. The thumb-cursor and easy access to information, plus the clever use of isolated downtime and joining back up at the gates for another quest, made every session flow smoothly for my team.\n\nFor a group that likes to play tabletop games together but wants a digital option, especially for remote friends, Sunderfolk should suit their needs. It’s a story of good and evil, filled with fantasy and animals and magic, and ready-made to take a crew through some haphazard adventures. Hopefully it’s not the last time we see these kinds of swings at it, either.\n\nSunderfolk will be released April 23 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.

It’s not nearly as blatant as some past examples of how Apple likes to depict Android devices in a degrading way, which is nice progress to see, though that’s likely in part due to the Beats brand being considerably more open to Android users.

            "description": "Games benefit greatly from a development team that has worked together for years, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle shows that.",
            "content": "If MachineGames is to be believed, the basement level of the Vatican is exempt from the strict Catholic doctrine that dominates the jurisdiction of the Holy See above ground. It's down there that you'll find the temples dedicated to faiths that sort of resemble Christianity if you squint a bit and turn your head on your side. And the underground boxing ring set up by Mussolini's plundering soldiers, who'll only let you in if you're wearing one of their infamous black shirts.\n\nThe latter is an early test of your ability to get to grips with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's fistfighting system. It's faster than you expect it's going to be, is the thing: both Indy's blows and those in response flying like boulders at terminal velocity. Dodging will get you so far, but don't expect your opponent to keep their arms at their sides while you're pummelling them in the face. To find an advantage, you'll need to block and parry, using both hands rather than sticking to the right trigger, and grabbing hold of your target when they stumble - either to get more hits in, or shove them toward the baying crowd.\n\nBaying being the key term. The core Indiana Jones development team first made a name for themselves back in 2004 with The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. That was a kind of first-person prison drama, about ingratiating yourself with fellow cons, instigating riots and stealing keycards, all in an effort to break yourself out of a triple-max security facility on a barren planet. Guns were a rarity - most of them registered to the DNA of the guard holding them, and so useless to you - and Butcher Bay was celebrated as perhaps the only successful example of hand-to-hand combat in an FPS at the time. In fact, FPS felt like a reductive term for this bold mixture of pugilism, stealth, adventure and conversation.\n\nThe Riddick team went on to make The Darkness, to similar acclaim, and most of its key names either founded MachineGames or joined it later. Their entries in the Wolfenstein canon are notable not only for dual-wielding shootouts, but for the deep characterisation of BJ Blazkowicz and his found family at the Kreisau Circle, as well as the memorable non-combat sequences that brought the player within intimate proximity of detestable villains like Deathshead and Frau Engel. MachineGames perfected a knack for blending b-movie absurdity with real storytelling chops, growing braver with each new project over a decade and a half.\n\nWhich brings us to Indiana Jones, MachineGames' opus. A game every bit as varied as Butcher Bay, if not more so; which boasts gunplay and action as slick as Wolfenstein's, but doesn't rely on it; that couldn't possibly have been made without the shared trust and creative shorthand that exists between a team who know each other as well as they know themselves.\n\nThe punch-ups under the Vatican are a microcosmic demonstration of that team's journey: their long commitment to immersive first-person adventure, and the extraordinary ways in which their creative talent has amplified over time. The ideas that once fuelled Butcher Bay are transformed by a level of fidelity and polish that produces thudding impacts, grimacing faces and flying helmets. The sounds of skirmish are cleverly sequenced, signalling subtly to the player whether or not their blows are connecting. This is a Michelin Star standard of pretend punching, enabled by a team which has stayed together and worked wonders as a result.\n\nLook at the top-rated games of the last few years, and you'll notice that many of them also benefitted from this kind of rolling snowball of experience. Baldur's Gate 3 couldn't have redefined the western RPG had Larian not been layering its systems over the triumphs of the Divinity: Original Sin games. And Original Sin would never have happened were it not for the stubbornness of Larian boss Swen Vincke and his Belgian veterans. They've been riding out the ups and downs of their genre since before the millennium, and are only now seeing the fruits of that devotion.\n\nWould Baldur's Gate 3 have even been possible from a new stuido? | Image credit: Larian\n\nBut the act of keeping teams together, which has always been a challenge in the volatile tech space, has become almost impossible in today's games industry. Since the soaring player numbers that followed the pandemic, game makers have endured a painful contraction. A common developer mantra of \"survive til '25\" now looks grimly quaint and naive, as a dry period of investment in video games continues unabated. Thousands of accomplished projects fight for player attention every year, and it's exceedingly common for studios to close after, or even before, the release of their debut games.\n\nThe margin for error has become invisible to the naked eye, leaving even seasoned teams with little chance to course correct. It's a landscape in which the likes of Arkane Austin can be shut down after a single disappointing game, Redfall, seemingly mangled by a publisher push for multiplayer. The hivemind that produced Prey and Dishonored has been disassembled forever.\n\nThe impact of that instability hasn't necessarily hit us as players yet. We're currently in the enviable position of cherry-picking from an unprecedented stream of five-star releases. Over time though, if publishers don't start to value institutional knowledge over short-term boosts to their share price, I suspect that top tier of releases - the Indiana Joneses, the Baldur's Gate 3s - will cease to occur. More developers will waste their time establishing new studios, filling out forms, designing logos, and repeating the mistakes of the dead studios before them. Newcomers to the industry won't benefit from the teaching of practiced programming or art or level design teams - because those teams will have been scattered to the winds. Building the kind of momentum that MachineGames has? That will become an impossibility.\n\nWhen Obsidian recently said that it plans to reach its 100th birthday as a studio by staying lean and making sensible bets, the plan sounded strange and radical. But it shouldn't. This is the way we get the greatest games ever made: by supporting studios and publishers who reject zero-sum projects; who do everything in their power to keep their creative staff together and look after one another. The best possible outcome, for developers and players alike, would be a Great Circle of 100-year-old game studios that spans the globe."

This is a similar setup to recent Bethesda releases like Starfield and Indiana Jones - and we have a similar price point on our hands here as well.\n\nGet a head start on slaying demons with the Premium Upgrade, including up to 2-Day Early Access, the campaign DLC, Digital Artbook and Soundtrack, and the Divinity Skin Pack, which includes matching skins for the DOOM Slayer, dragon and Atlan.\n\nThat price point is £31.49 / $31.49 for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and with the base game heading to the service on day one, you won't have to shell out any more money for it - with the catch being that you must remain a subscriber post-launch in order to keep playing. Alternatively, there's a more expensive Premium Edition that contains all the same content as the Upgrade version plus the base game as well.\n\nIf you decided to go ahead and pick up this DLC, the new DOOM would be playable on May 13th as opposed to the Standard Edition's May 15th release date.\n\nPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale. Please read our FTC Disclosure for more information.\n\nAs for what you can expect from the included campaign DLC, well, Bethesda hasn't announced anything just yet - but the team at id Software did a great job with the story add-ons for DOOM Eternal. The two-part Ancient Gods DLC was a fine expansion to the main game back in 2021."

            "description": "Microsoft may want you to trade in your old Windows 10 PC, but there are a lot more useful things you can do with it to keep it relevant.",
            "content": "Microsoft really wants users to move on from Windows 10, and recently, the company suggested that if you have a Windows 10 PC that can't upgrade to Windows 11, you should trade that PC in and buy a new one. But realistically, trading in an old PC might not get you that much of a discount, and there a lot of ways you can make it useful without giving it away.\n\nAs someone who prefers avoiding waste, I find that re-using old tech in new ways is a fantastic idea, so I wanted to give you some ideas for getting a bit more out of your old hardware, whether you're planning to buy a new PC or not.\n\n7 Install Linux\n\nI had to say it\n\nClose\n\nI'm not going to pretend I'm a big Linux aficionado. Or that I've ever used a Linux PC in any situation I wasn't forced to do so because of work. But realistically, if you want to extend the life of your PC, you shouldn't abide by what Microsoft defines as the end of support, and Linux is the way to go if you want to get a few more years out of your hardware.\n\nLinux comes in a lot of flavors, called distros, but one thing most of them have in common is relatively low system requirements and very long-term support, even for older hardware. If you put Linux on your PC, you could very well be looking at ten extra years with that machine if you really want to.\n\nNot every Linux distro is going to be friendly for beginners, but if you want to have an easier time, you might want to start with Ubuntu. Some advanced Linux users may scoff at it, but it's the most properly built-out platform for those just trying Linux for the first time. Another potentially good option is Pop! OS. Give them a shot, and you'll probably find a lot to love.\n\n6 Make it a retro gaming machine\n\nEmulation Station to the rescue\n\nClose\n\nOne of the coolest projects I've carried out myself with an old Windows PC was turning it into a retro gaming machine with Emulation Station. Your old computer may not be suitable to go on the internet once it stops getting security updates, but you can still use it to play thousands of retro games, and Emulation Station is an amazing way to turn your computer into a gaming machine.\n\nEmulation Station offers a beautiful, sleek UI that makes browsing the history of gaming a wonderful experience. It looks really nice and it works beautifully with a controller, so you can set this up in your living room TV and use it easily without having to pull out a keyboard and mouse every time. Emulation Station has lots of emulators for different platforms so you can experience multiple decades of gaming without issue. If you're downloading games from the internet, though, maybe use a different computer and then move the files to your gaming machine so you don't risk getting viruses on it.\n\n5 Make it a media server\n\nWatch your movies and shows offline\n\nClose\n\nAnother possible use for your old PC is turning it into a home media server. Many people have probably reached streaming service overload at this point, so being able to watch your favorite shows offline on your terms is a great solution for many people, and that's why solutions like Plex and Jellyfin exist.\n\nThese platforms let you manage and easily browse media so that you can watch it on any device in your home, but without needing an internet connection. It makes it easy to enjoy your favorite movies and shows in higher quality without paying subscription fees that bleed your wallet dry and still have annoying restrictions at times. Again, you may want to use a different PC to load up your media so you're not connecting to the internet and potentially shady websites, but otherwise, this is a very good use for an old PC.\n\n4 Use it as a game server\n\nMinecraft, anyone?\n\nClose\n\nAnother thing you can use an old PC for is hosting game servers in games that support it. Minecraft is a very popular game where you can create your own servers and have friends join you for a specific kind of experience. Setting up a Minecraft server can be a bit of a hassle, but if you have the time to spare, it's a fun project to undertake.\n\nA few other games will let you create your own servers, so it's a matter of looking around for options. While this isn't a use case I would personally care for all that much, it might be worth it for you.\n\nRelated How I turned my SBC into a Minecraft server Don't waste your time or money using online providers; here's how I setup a Minecraft server on my Raspberry Pi\n\n3 Power your smart home\n\nHome Assistant is amazing\n\nClose\n\nOne of the few projects I've ever done for work that I actually still use actively to this day is turning one of my Windows PCs into a Home Assistant server. Home Assistant is a platform that can connect with all kinds of smart home devices using a local connection, and it centralizes a lot of devices that often need dedicated apps, making it easy to manage them all from one interface.\n\nI use Home Assistant to to control my smart lights, control playback on my Google TV, as virtual remotes for my TVs, and even as a sort of media server if there's a video I want to watch on the big screen in full quality. It's not really a media server, to be clear, and the UI and UX are not optimized for this use case, but it works as a rudimentary solution for my needs, and it's really easy to cast the media stored on it to any of the connected smart displays in my house.\n\nI really love Home Assistant, even as someone who isn't much of a tinkerer. If I can get this much use out of it, I suspect many more proficient users can make Home Assistant even more useful, so I highly recommend checking it out.\n\nRelated How you can turn an old PC into a smart home hub Your old PC can become useful in a whole new way, while reducing your reliance on cloud services to control your smart home.\n\n2 Turn it into a NAS\n\nBackup storage for all your devices\n\nClose\n\nOne of the coolest uses you can have for an old PC is one of the most basic ones, too. Turning your old PC into a NAS is an excellent way to give yourself a backup of all your important data. With a NAS, you have access to a pool of storage from any device on your home network (and even the internet if you set up a proper VPN). You can back up files from different PCs and phones, as if it's your own personal cloud service (now without extra monthly fees), and a NAS can even run Plex if you also want it to be your media server at the same time.\n\nYou can kind of use Windows to power a NAS, but the ideal solution you'll probably want to look into is using something like TrueNAS or UnRAID, which are designed for this kind of thing. Setting up is going to take some time and patience if you're new to this process, but once you do, it will be worth it. And because an old PC is likely to have a much faster processor than a typical NAS, you can expect exceptional performance for a long time to come. It will come in handy if you do end up running Plex on it.\n\nRelated How to turn an old PC into a NAS If you have an old PC still lying around, you could turn it into a NAS.\n\n1 Kickstart your home lab\n\nYou can do so much\n\nFinally, if you're really intereste din tinkering and exploring the maximum potential of your old PC, you have the option to create a home lab. Using a dedicated OS like Proxmox, or a platform like Docker, you can create containers that host all kinds of services and tools, turning your PC into a powerhouse that can do almost anything.\n\nYou can host your own cloud service, run Home Assistant, set up a media server, and more, all using containers on the same device. A home lab can contain many of the solutions I already mentioned above, so it's truly the most versatile option, though it's also a more complex one than doing any of these things individually, so it's not the easiest place to start if you're new to this kind of tinkering.\n\nRelated A beginner's guide to setting up Proxmox It's quite easy to configure Proxmox for your home lab server\n\nYour PC still has life in it\n\nAs much as Microsoft wants you to believe your old PC is ready to be retired, there's a lot you can do with it still. You can keep using it as a regular PC by installing Linux, but there are tons of other purposes it cna serve in your home even if you do buy a new PC. Either way, you don't have top say goodbye just yet, and you might end up saving more money by keeping your PC at home."

Looking at the game's store pages, it seems some upcoming titles won't support the Nintendo Switch Online Cloud Save feature — or maybe they will, it's all a bit confusing (thanks for the heads up, Eurogamer).\n\nAs was pointed out in a recent Resetera thread by user RandomlyRandom67, the Tears of the Kingdom Nintendo Switch 2 Edition page on Nintendo's website houses the following disclaimer: \"Please note: this software does not support the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership's Save Data Cloud backup feature\".\n\nYou'll find the same message at the bottom of Nintendo's Donkey Kong Bananza listing, and the original poster claimed it could also be found on the Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition pages, but it seems to have been removed now. Hmm.\n\nWhere things get really confusing, however, is how these disclaimers appear to only be present on the European and North American game listings. Eurogamer noted that no such message appears on the Japanese site for any of the games, muddying the waters even further. Again, hmmmmm.\n\nWe've reached out to Nintendo for a comment on these cloud save shenanigans and will update this article when we hear back.\n\nRemoving the NSO cloud save option from new Switch 2 games is a baffling move, but taking it from the likes of TOTK — which, let's not forget, supported it in its Switch 1 form — makes even less sense. We know that you'll be able to move your original BOTW and TOTK save files over to the Switch 2 editions, but, if the disclaimer is correct, you won't be able to make a new cloud save in the latter once it's there. Surely there's been a mistake here.\n\nWe'll be keeping an eye out for more clarification in the run-up to Switch 2's launch, but until then, cherish you're cloud saves, folks. Who knows how long they'll last?"

            "description": "Researchers developed a more efficient way to control the outputs of a large language model, guiding it to generate text that adheres to a certain structure, like a programming language, and remains error free.",
            "content": "Programmers can now use large language models (LLMs) to generate computer code more quickly. However, this only makes programmers’ lives easier if that code follows the rules of the programming language and doesn’t cause a computer to crash.\n\nSome methods exist for ensuring LLMs conform to the rules of whatever language they are generating text in, but many of these methods either distort the model’s intended meaning or are too time-consuming to be feasible for complex tasks.\n\nA new approach developed by researchers at MIT and elsewhere automatically guides an LLM to generate text that adheres to the rules of the relevant language, such as a particular programming language, and is also error-free. Their method allows an LLM to allocate efforts toward outputs that are most likely to be valid and accurate, while discarding unpromising outputs early in the process. This probabilistic approach boosts computational efficiency.\n\nDue to these efficiency gains, the researchers’ architecture enabled small LLMs to outperform much larger models in generating accurate, properly structured outputs for several real-world use cases, including molecular biology and robotics.\n\nIn the long run, this new architecture could help nonexperts control AI-generated content. For instance, it could allow businesspeople to write complex queries in SQL, a language for database manipulation, using only natural language prompts.\n\n“This work has implications beyond research. It could improve programming assistants, AI-powered data analysis, and scientific discovery tools by ensuring that AI-generated outputs remain both useful and correct,” says João Loula, an MIT graduate student and co-lead author of a paper on this framework.\n\nLoula is joined on the paper by co-lead authors Benjamin LeBrun, a research assistant at the Mila-Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, and Li Du, a graduate student at John Hopkins University; co-senior authors Vikash Mansinghka ’05, MEng ’09, PhD ’09, a principal research scientist and leader of the Probabilistic Computing Project in the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences; Alexander K. Lew SM ’20, an assistant professor at Yale University; Tim Vieira, a postdoc at ETH Zurich; and Timothy J. O’Donnell, an associate professor at McGill University and a Canada CIFAR AI Chair at Mila, who led the international team; as well as several others. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations.\n\nEnforcing structure and meaning\n\nOne common approach for controlling the structured text generated by LLMs involves checking an entire output, like a block of computer code, to make sure it is valid and will run error-free. If not, the user must start again, racking up computational resources.\n\nOn the other hand, a programmer could stop to check the output along the way. While this can ensure the code adheres to the programming language and is structurally valid, incrementally correcting the code may cause it to drift from the meaning the user intended, hurting its accuracy in the long run.\n\n“It is much easier to enforce structure than meaning. We can quickly check whether something is in the right programming language, but to check its meaning you have to execute the code. Our work is also about dealing with these different types of information,” Loula says.\n\nThe researchers’ approach involves engineering knowledge into the LLM to steer it toward the most promising outputs. These outputs are more likely to follow the structural constraints defined by a user, and to have the meaning the user intends.\n\n“We are not trying to train an LLM to do this. Instead, we are engineering some knowledge that an expert would have and combining it with the LLM’s knowledge, which offers a very different approach to scaling than you see in deep learning,” Mansinghka adds.\n\nThey accomplish this using a technique called sequential Monte Carlo, which enables parallel generation from an LLM to compete with each other. The model dynamically allocates resources to different threads of parallel computation based on how promising their output appears.\n\nEach output is given a weight that represents how likely it is to be structurally valid and semantically accurate. At each step in the computation, the model focuses on those with higher weights and throws out the rest.\n\nIn a sense, it is like the LLM has an expert looking over its shoulder to ensure it makes the right choices at each step, while keeping it focused on the overall goal. The user specifies their desired structure and meaning, as well as how to check the output, then the researchers’ architecture guides the LLM to do the rest.\n\n“We’ve worked out the hard math so that, for any kinds of constraints you’d like to incorporate, you are going to get the proper weights. In the end, you get the right answer,” Loula says.\n\nBoosting small models\n\nTo test their approach, they applied the framework to LLMs tasked with generating four types of outputs: Python code, SQL database queries, molecular structures, and plans for a robot to follow.\n\nWhen compared to existing approaches, the researchers’ method performed more accurately while requiring less computation.\n\nIn Python code generation, for instance, the researchers’ architecture enabled a small, open-source model to outperform a specialized, commercial closed-source model that is more than double its size.\n\n“We are very excited that we can allow these small models to punch way above their weight,” Loula says.\n\nMoving forward, the researchers want to use their technique to control larger chunks of generated text, rather than working one small piece at a time. They also want to combine their method with learning, so that as they control the outputs a model generates, it learns to be more accurate.\n\nIn the long run, this project could have broader applications for non-technical users. For instance, it could be combined with systems for automated data modeling, and querying generative models of databases.\n\nThe approach could also enable machine-assisted data analysis systems, where the user can converse with software that accurately models the meaning of the data and the questions asked by the user, adds Mansinghka.\n\n“One of the fundamental questions of linguistics is how the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences can be grounded in models of the world, accounting for uncertainty and vagueness in meaning and reference. LLMs, predicting likely token sequences, don’t address this problem. Our paper shows that, in narrow symbolic domains, it is technically possible to map from words to distributions on grounded meanings. It’s a small step towards deeper questions in cognitive science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence needed to understand how machines can communicate about the world like we do,” says O’Donnell.\n\nThis research is funded and supported, in part, by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs Program, the MIT Quest for Intelligence, and Convergent Research."

            "content": "Why it matters: Windows 11's Snipping Tool already allows you to copy text from images, offering functionality similar to Apple's Live Text – but Microsoft's implementation involves a few more steps. A new Windows 11 Insider update aims to streamline the process of grabbing text from various sources for easier copying and pasting.\n\nWindows Insiders in the Canary and Dev channels can now test a feature that moves the Snipping Tool's text extractor directly to the main toolbar. This change eliminates the need to take a screenshot before capturing text.\n\nThe current public version of Windows 11 includes a text extractor in both the Snipping Tool and Photos apps. After opening an image in either program, users can copy text from the picture by clicking the extractor icon – located at the top of the Snipping Tool window or the bottom of the Photos window.\n\nFor further context, Microsoft offered this kind of functionality before in Windows via PowerToys, but that compares unfavorably to Macs or iPhones which have allowed users to select and copy text from photos by simply tapping and dragging since at least 2021.\n\nWindows 11 Insider 11.2503.27.0 adds the extractor icon to the Snipping Tool capture toolbar, which appears after launching the app from the Start Menu or by pressing Win + Shift + S.\n\nAfter clicking the text extractor, users can drag the rectangular snip selector over the portion of the screen containing the desired text.\n\nOnce selected, users can highlight specific text or copy the entire selection to the clipboard. A dropdown menu offers additional options, such as removing line breaks or automatically copying all text within the selected area by clicking \"Copy all text.\" Although preview features don't always make it into public builds, adding this kind of functionality to the Snipping Tool seems like a no-brainer at this point.\n\nUsers interested in testing Windows' upcoming features can register their Microsoft accounts with the Insider Program. To provide feedback on the new update, open the Feedback Hub via the Start Menu or by pressing Win + F, then navigate to Apps > Snipping Tool.\n\nWindows 11 preview versions have also recently introduced new Android phone integrations, launched a gaming optimization FAQ, and attempted to relaunch the controversial Recall feature.\n\nRecall which relies on GenAI and NPUs was meant to be launched last year, but Microsoft was forced to delay it due to security and privacy concerns. Recall allows Copilot to access a timeline of user actions to perform natural language search and commands. However, it works by taking snapshots of nearly everything happening on your PC at any given time. Although Microsoft has taken extra time to added security measures, many users remain skeptical about those assurances."

            "content": "Up until a week ago, it was thought that Elena was going to release at some point in April or May for Street Fighter 6, but turns out that's not the case after all.\n\nWe now know thanks to the teaser trailer that Elena is coming as the last Season 2 DLC character on June 5, which has implications for the Street Fighter scene as a whole.\n\nPresumably, Capcom is also going to release the big Season 3 balance update at the same time as Elena like they did last year for Akuma.\n\nNow that the patch is likely not coming until June as well, that will produce some issues for the competitive scene of SF6 specifically.\n\nPart of the reason many believed Elena would come in April or May was the fact that the Capcom Pro Tour 2025 season is starting up in less than a month.\n\nIt looks like currently, however, the third competitive year is going to begin while still playing the second season of the game.\n\nAnd it's not just for one event either.\n\nThere's Evo Japan 2025 with the second largest Evo bracket ever taking place from May 9–11 and then Combo Breaker 2025 at the end of the month too.\n\nThat's two of the limited offline event Capcom Cup slots up for grabs running on the \"old\" version of the game while the rest of the season will presumably be run on Season 3's updates.\n\nThis shows now there is a pretty clear disconnection between the content aspect of Street Fighter 6 and the competitive scene.\n\nWe did get a taste of this last year when Akuma and the Season 2 update came right before Combo Breaker 2024, and then it happened again with M. Bison's launch and CEO 2024.\n\nThat was a bit different, however, since those majors were not part of the CPT circuit, but now we're seeing it at a bigger level.\n\nThis is all plans from Capcom directly, and it's weird that they'd be apparently out of sync like this.\n\nAs far as we know, a Capcom Pro Tour season (at least since Street Fighter 5) has not begun running on the previous year's version of the game.\n\nWe're not sure of course what's causing this disconnect whether it be an internal delay of Elena and the Season 3 patch or other scheduling conflicts, but there's something going on behind the scenes.\n\nThis desync can even be seen in the content reveals too with Elena's teaser skipping Capcom Cup 11 for some reason and instead dropping on a seemingly random Thursday connected to nothing — and that goes for pretty much all events now outside of Evo.\n\nObviously, the new content is where Street Fighter 6 is going to make pretty much all of the game's money now, but the Capcom Pro Tour also positions itself as the leader of FGC pro circuits.\n\nAnd we're not really seeing any other fighting games have this issue either.\n\nWe've seen before how the development pipeline for SF6 does not appear to be moving as fast as fans expect considering how long it's taken to get Outfit 4 options in the game — and we still haven't seen those yet after almost a year and a half since Outfit 3 dropped.\n\nGames are more expensive and complicated to develop than ever before, but again, it just feels weird that it's taking the team this long to get content out the door compared to Street Fighter 5 and their current competition.\n\nMortal Kombat 1 dropped like six new fighters in the time it took SF6 to get one, and Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves has committed to releasing new characters every two months before the game is even out.\n\nMeanwhile, there's a four-month gap between Mai and Elena.\n\nAnd now that's bled over into the competitive scene as well.\n\nIt just feels like a bit of a disservice now to the competitors who put more time into the game than anyone else.\n\nBut who knows, maybe Capcom has some more unexpected decisions they'll be rolling out.\n\nThere's nothing technically stopping them from dropping the Season 3 balance update before Elena though we have our doubts that would actually come to pass.\n\nInstead, it looks like Street Fighter 6 is going to be starting the next leg of its journey with a disconnect to the dedicated community supporting the game most.\n\nHopefully, the Street Fighter 6 team starts to communicate more about what's going on and what their plans are for the game like they did towards the end of the last entry.\n\nWe're all ears here."

            "content": "WASHINGTON — Even as NASA and its partners on the International Space Station shift to commercial space stations, NASA’s former deputy administrator believes there will still be a role for multilateral coordination of work on those stations.\n\nSpeaking at a Royal Aeronautical Society symposium on international space partnerships here April 16, Pam Melroy, a former astronaut who served as deputy administrator of NASA in the Biden administration, said the experience of the ISS shows the need for coordination among partners on future commercial stations.\n\n“We’re all still watching and thinking,” she said of plans for how commercial stations will operate. “It’s really about trust, and it’s about the relationships. The great thing is that we have these deep relationships with our partners and we’re beginning to grow them with other, new partners.”\n\nThe experience of the ISS, she said, showed the value of “certain very-high-level boards” in ISS operations, such as one multilateral board, primarily of doctors, who provide medical approval for crews going to the station. Other multilateral boards make key decisions on station architecture, she added.\n\n“I do think that something like that is going to be needed, ultimately,” she concluded.\n\nAnother issue she raised was the need for “harmonization” of space law among various international participants in commercial space stations, which will be outside the current intergovernmental agreement that governs activities on the ISS.\n\n“There’s some work to be done. There’s going to have to be harmonization of space law because now you’ve got a commercial entity,” she said. “What does it mean to have one country fly commercially to another country’s space station? We’re going to have to figure out how to get through that.”\n\nBoth companies developing commercial space stations and current ISS partners such as Canada, Europe and Japan have been trying to determine the best way to work together after the end of the ISS. Some countries have expressed concerns about paying American companies for access to their stations, preferring to spend their money domestically, as they are able to do through the ISS partnership by exchanging services.\n\nSome companies, in response, have been working to establish agreements with companies and governments to give them greater roles in their stations. Starlab Space, for example, is working with Europe’s Airbus Defence and Space, Japan’s Mitsubishi and Canada’s MDA Space on its proposed space station.\n\nThere are other lessons to take from the ISS, including how to access it. “Because the systems grew up organically, there six or seven or eight different ways to get an experiment to the space station,” she noted, making it confusing for people wanting to fly payloads. “The next step is to try and shrink that down a little bit.”\n\nThat could be done, she suggested, through a single “microgravity institute” organization, which would coordinate payloads from U.S. government agencies and perhaps international partners. That institute could also pool medical data from people flying to the station, as is done on the ISS today, while preserving medical privacy.\n\nMelroy expressed confidence that some solutions will be developed to those issues during the transition from the ISS to commercial space stations. “The signals are very clear that the partners want to stay together in low Earth orbit.”"

Additionally, a post by SamMobile confirms the launcher's availability for more countries globally via the Galaxy Store. While the Play Store doesn't get too in-depth about its complete redesign, it gives us a glimpse of its refreshed main plug-in page.\n\nThe launcher breaks things down to give users quick access to \"Extensions\" and device \"Gestures\" in small bubbles. Beneath that is a complete list of available plug-ins, which seems to have remained similar to its previous iteration. The plug-ins page now offers the Good Lock name with the \"Your Galaxy Your Way\" tagline in a purple-to-pink gradient banner.\n\nThe \"You\" tab features more of the same refreshments with defined \"Favorites\" and \"Settings in Effect\" categories.\n\nGood Lock & One UI 7\n\n(Image credit: Google Play Store)\n\nStrangely, as 9to5 notes, the Play Store's Galaxy device compatibility is a little wonky. The store reportedly lacks mention of devices aside from the Galaxy S25 \"when installing remotely.\" It's unclear if this is a visual bug. The post adds that the Galaxy S24 can download it, provided it is running One UI 7. The publication states it's tried to install the launcher on a Fold 6, but it's oddly \"blocked.\"\n\nConsidering it's recent appearance, there's likely a few issues Samsung needs to sort out for its Galaxy devices globally. If you're encountering similar problems, it might be worth trying the launcher on the Galaxy Store instead.\n\nSamsung started preparing us for a global Good Lock launch in January when it also highlighted its expected redesign. The company announced Good Lock would be available for \"all countries\" via the Play Store. A first for its Galaxy launcher. Users will find customization plug-ins like Home Up. In One UI 7, users can get pretty creative and wacky with it, as one Reddit user discovered.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe Korean OEM pushed a small QoL update for the Good Lock in March.

            "description": "Google's Elizabeth Reid says AI Overviews drive 'higher-quality clicks' as many publishers watch organic traffic decline.",
            "content": "AI Overviews, Google’s AI-generated summaries that sit above organic search results, are already eroding traffic for many publishers and creators. However, publishers are getting “higher-quality clicks,” according to Elizabeth Reid, Head of Google Search, in a new interview.\n\nWhy we care. Google Search is continuing to evolve in the direction of AI Overviews, where less clicks to websites is the new normal.\n\nClicks. Here are some quotes from Reid’s interview with the Financial Times about the AI Overviews and the impact on clicks and traffic (a.k.a., that necessary evil) to publishers:\n\n“We see the clicks are of higher quality, because they’re not clicking on a webpage, realising it wasn’t what they want and immediately bailing. So, they spend more time on those sites. We see that it shows a greater diversity of websites that come up.\n\n“What you see with something like AI Overviews, when you bring the friction down for users, is people search more and that opens up new opportunities for websites, for creators, for publishers to access. And they get higher-quality clicks.”\n\nReid also said that AI Overviews are “designed to get you started and then help you dive deeper,” because “relying on webpages… can be difficult and AI Overviews provide more “substance” than individual webpages:\n\n“But if your question is long, finding a webpage that covers every part of your question is hard, and sometimes what you get is a very surface-level webpage. Technically it talks about every one of your words, but you didn’t get much substance. With generative AI, we can go and look for web pages that talk about specific subsets. So, we’ll take that query, and we’ll turn it into multiple queries. “And then we’ll say, a-ha, OK, you’re comparing two items that are not traditionally compared. Let me find a webpage about one item. Let me find a webpage about another. And then, you can expose websites that go in more depth on part of a topic, instead of just a webpage that is surface level about the whole topic.”\n\nNot the first time. Reid follows Alphabet/Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who previously said that AI Overviews are good for click-through rate (CTR):\n\n“If you put content and links within AI Overviews, they get higher clickthrough rates than if you put it outside of AI Overviews.”\n\nBut. I’ve seen no evidence to back up Reid or Pichai’s claim. CTRs to websites are hitting new lows. Also, traffic and revenue for several websites (see: Chegg as one example) started to decline around May, which is when Google launched AI Overviews. Microsoft Bing’s Fabrice Canel has also talked about “qualified clicks” being the measure of success in AI search.\n\nAds and AI Overviews. There are “a lot of opportunities for ads” above, below and within AI Overviews, according to Reid, adding that “Ads are relevant whenever users are going to make a choice that has some commercial aspect”:\n\n“When a query is predominantly commercial intent — like we think you want to buy something — then we might often show ads. But sometimes we think you probably don’t want to [see] ads, and so we don’t want to give everyone ads. But some people might want to buy something. If [you search] ‘how to clean a stain out of the couch’ and the first thing we show is a bunch of ads, you’re like, ‘Whoa, I just wanted some advice.’ “But if we’re giving you ideas and then we say, ‘if you’re having trouble you might want to consider a stain-remover product’, and then we give you some ads for stain-remover products, it feels natural and in context.”\n\nHow search will change. Some of Reid’s notable quotes:\n\n“…we want to make search effortless. That assumes multimodalities…”\n\n“It will get more personalised over time, not just in the results, but in how you learn well. Are you somebody who learns well with videos or are you someone who prefers text?”\n\nHow search won’t change. Reid said “never say never” about there being a paid version of Google Search, but Google Search will remain free for the foreseeable future:\n\n“Ensuring that search in general, the essence of it, is available for free, to allow access to information, will be important. There may be some aspects for people who have subscriptions in the future. But the core of search we want to have available for everyone for free, yes.\n\nGoogle Search also won’t become a “chatbot” in the style of ChatGPT, according to Reid:\n\n“We think of search as more of an information-focused question. We are starting to experiment more with the idea that people sometimes have a question that has multiple parts plus a follow-up. And if you have a follow-up question, you don’t want to start over from scratch. “But it’s more designed as: how can you further your journey without repeating it the same way you might to a human — rather than designing it in the sense of: do you have a friend to chat with and ask them their views? It’s much more about organising information.”\n\nAlso:\n\n“We put a lot of effort in our models on paying attention to factuality. That’s a way that we make a different choice on search, compared with a chatbot. You typically have to choose between how factual it is versus how creative or how conversational it is. “If you’re building a product that’s designed to be conversational, you might weigh it one way. But in the case of [Google] Search, we have weighted factuality and put extensive work into that. We have continued to raise the bar on that for the past several months.\n\nHow people are searching differently. According to Reid:\n\nYounger users are asking “more and longer questions” and “more nuanced questions.”\n\n“We see a lot of growth in multi-modality: people asking these text-plus- image questions. So, it’s not just, ‘What is this image?’ or ‘Here’s my question’, but combining them.\n\nThe interview. Google’s Elizabeth Reid: ‘Human curiosity is boundless and people ask a lot of questions’ (subscription required)"

This makes it easy to get lost in the exploration of the map, setting up your base, and trying to find assorted and new materials that you need. Following the main story in Dragonwilds is the best way to explore during the early and middle parts of the game, however.\n\nEvery time you get assigned a new quest, you'll visit a part of the map you likely haven't seen before. This, in turn, gives you access to new resources, creatures, and enemies that allow you to upgrade your base and character. For example, as you're looking for Cathan in the main story, you'll eventually travel to a region called Fractured Plains, which has veins of Copper and Tin Ore. These ores allow you to craft Bronze Bars and Bronze gear, making your character much stronger and giving you a chance against stronger enemies in combat.\n\nOverall, as long as you follow the main story in Dragonwilds, you should easily be able to keep up with what's happening at your base and with your character."

This week: The latest on Amazon’s secret new TV OS, and Meta’s plans to jumpstart its metaverse development with AI.\n\nAmazon pushes ahead with new Vega TV OS, plans to release first non-Android streaming device this year\n\nAmazon continues to pursue a transition away from Android for its TV hardware: The company plans to release a first TV streaming device powered by its still-unannounced Vega OS later this year and has been courting major publishers to bring their apps to the platform, I’ve been able to confirm with sources familiar with the company’s plans as well as through a number of leaks.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nVega is a Linux-based operating system that may one day replace Amazon’s Android-based Fire OS across a wide variety of devices, as I was first able to report in November of 2023. The company has already launched three Vega-powered devices: The company’s Echo Show 5 and Echo Hub smart displays both run Vega, as does the Echo Spot smart clock / speaker.\n\nAmazon has been slower in adopting Vega for its smart TVs and streaming players. The company originally planned to launch a Vega-powered streaming stick in late 2024, but ultimately delayed that launch. More recently, Amazon revealed that it is bringing an updated version of its Android-based TV OS to smart TVs released this year, leading to some speculation that the company may be abandoning Vega."

Just like with all the others (Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Portal with RTX), the feature is a PC exclusive.\n\nOn the subject, the developer said:\n\nExpanding on Ray Tracing technology and available as a new “Ultra Max” option in the graphics settings, light now follows every bounced path, including that from indirect lighting and multiple reflections. Shade, light, and colours dynamically shift as they would in real-life, whether you’re racing under the thousands of lights in Bahrain or navigating the castle section on Baku at sunset.\n\nIf you have a PC capable of experiencing it, Path Tracing is the most realistic simulation of light on track that we’ve ever delivered.\n\nThese aren't the only visual and technical improvements that fans will find in F1 25. Tonemapping and light balance improvements promise a more dramatic effect in all types of weather, with better representation of changes in cloud cover. There are also some enhancements to the track surface shader, which now displays more pronounced tyre and lock-up marks as well as physical changes based on other collected real-world data.\n\nThe addition of light detection and ranging scanning (LIDAR) makes tracks far more accurate overall. LIDAR also helped trees and foliage better match the species, placement, size, and shape of their real-life counterparts, with new additions such as cherry blossom trees in Suzuka.\n\nCodemasters also introduced NVIDIA Audio2Face. This technology (already seen in STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl) improved the facial animations that players will see during modes such as Career and Braking Point. The reintroduced press interviews now capture drivers delivering their responses in a more authentic fashion, with this technology extending to facility heads in My Team. Lastly, PS5 Pro console users will enjoy split-screen racing at 60 frames per second in this year's edition of the official F1 racing game.\n\nCodemasters hasn't shared the system requirements for path tracing usage on PC, but we'll let you know once it does. F1 25 will be available on May 30 across PC and consoles."

            "description": "Dragons, Monks, and an angelic planeswalker are among Standard's hottest cards from Tarkir: Dragonstorm.",
            "content": "Hello, and welcome back to Metagame Mentor, your weekly guide to the top decks and latest Constructed developments on the path to the Pro Tour. Magic's newest set, Tarkir: Dragonstorm, has made its mark on Standard, introducing new archetypes and shaking up the metagame.\n\nIn this article, I'll dive into the earliest Standard results featuring Tarkir: Dragonstorm, highlighting the most important additions from the set. The first week of this new Standard format has only scratched the surface, but if the early innovations are any indication, the upcoming series of Regional Championships promise to be a thrilling ride.\n\nThe Standard Metagame with Tarkir: Dragonstorm\n\nStandard, the rotating 60-card format, currently spans expansion sets from Dominaria United onward. To capture an early snapshot of the metagame, I analyzed 192 published decklists from Magic Online Challenges held from April 9–12, along with Top 8 lists from the Standard RCQ at SCG CON Denver. While the sample size of 200 decklists is modest, it offers a valuable glimpse at what the set promises.\n\nTo show which decks are dominating the top tables, I assigned points to each deck based on its rectified number of net wins—calculated as the number of match wins minus losses, with negative values adjusted to zero. By combining these points across all events, each archetype's share of the total rectified net wins blends popularity and performance into a single, comprehensive metric: the winner's metagame share.\n\nIn this table, each archetype name hyperlinks to a top-performing decklist that closely reflects its aggregate build. The \"Other\" category collects decks with less than one percent metagame share, including inventive brews like Five-Color Legends, Dimir Demons, Mardu Pixie, Gruul Leyline, Mono-White Tokens, and Boros Prowess.\n\nThe most-played non-land cards across all main decks were Monstrous Rage , Stormchaser's Talent , Burst Lightning , Nowhere to Run , and Heartfire Hero . Their prevalence underscores that Standard is driven by efficient one-mana creatures and interactive spells, particularly in aggressive red decks. In today's metagame, falling behind is not an option.\n\nCompared to my previous metagame snapshot before the release of Tarkir: Dragonstorm, there's been a clear shift. Izzet Prowess has rocketed into a top-tier contender, seemingly out of nowhere. With Cori-Steel Cutter at its core, the archetype now rivals Mono-Red Aggro in both popularity and potency. Meanwhile, Domain Overlords—the deck that triumphed at Pro Tour Aetherdrift—has seen a sharp decline. As a result, Up the Beanstalk has largely vanished from the spotlight.\n\nThe Most-Played Cards from Tarkir: Dragonstorm\n\nTarkir: Dragonstorm has injected a wealth of powerful new cards into Standard, breathing new life into both established and emerging archetypes. The table below highlights the 20 most played new-to-Standard cards across the decklists I analyzed.\n\nCard Name Total Copies Main Deck Sideboard 1. Sunpearl Kirin 149 149 0 2. Cori-Steel Cutter 146 143 3 3. Tersa Lightshatter 80 72 8 4. Desperate Measures 32 32 0 5. Elspeth, Storm Slayer 28 27 1 6. Winternight Stories 20 20 0 7. Marang River Regent 17 17 0 8. Shiko, Paragon of the Way 17 17 0 9. Jeskai Revelation 15 8 7 10. Herd Heirloom 14 14 0 11. Roiling Dragonstorm 13 13 0 12. Heritage Reclamation 13 0 13 13. Mystic Monastery 9 9 0 14. Dispelling Exhale 9 9 0 15. Surrak, Elusive Hunter 8 4 4 16. Cori Mountain Monastery 7 7 0 17. Glacial Dragonhunt 6 6 0 18. Scavenger Regent 6 4 2 19. Rot-Curse Rakshasa 6 6 0 20. Voice of Victory 5 0 5\n\nSunpearl Kirin claims the title of the most played card in Standard from Tarkir: Dragonstorm. Functionally, it's a two-mana Nurturing Pixie with flash, which has reinforced the consistency of self-bounce strategies. From Esper Pixie to Orzhov Pixie and even Mardu Pixie, the Kirin has proved itself as a strong role-player.\n\nBut in terms of raw power and multi-format potential, the standout star is arguably Cori-Steel Cutter . It's a formidable token-generating engine that, as an artifact, is more to remove than a creature. In the right shell, Cori-Steel Cutter is easy to trigger turn after turn, snowballing into a relentless swarm of Monks. While its main home is in Izzet Prowess, a wide range of decks have embraced it, including Boros Pia, Grixis Bounce, and Mardu Pixie. Even a handful of Mono-Red Aggro and Gruul Mice decks have already incorporated Cori-Steel Cutter .\n\nTo better understand how these new cards are shaping the metagame, let's take a closer look at the archetypes that have gained the most from Tarkir: Dragonstorm's standout additions.\n\nCori-Steel Cutter Supercharges Izzet Prowess\n\n693583\n\n1 Bounce Off 4 Burst Lightning 4 Cori-Steel Cutter 5 Island 4 Monastery Swiftspear 4 Monstrous Rage 4 Mountain 4 Opt 4 Riverpyre Verge 4 Shivan Reef 4 Sleight of Hand 4 Slickshot Show-Off 2 Spell Pierce 4 Spirebluff Canal 4 Stock Up 4 Stormchaser's Talent 2 Disdainful Stroke 3 Ghost Vacuum 2 Sunspine Lynx 3 Third Path Iconoclast 4 Torch the Tower 1 Witchstalker Frenzy\n\nAt first glance, it might seem odd to run an aggressive red deck in Standard without the ubiquitous Mice package. But Cori-Steel Cutter has changed the equation, catapulting Izzet Prowess into the same tier as Mono-Red Aggro, if not beyond it.\n\nThe deck is as elegant as it is deadly. On turn three, cast Cori-Steel Cutter and a cheap spell like Opt to generate a Monk token, equip it with Cori-Steel Cutter , and swing for two. From there, the deck uses a suite of one-mana spells, card-draw effects, and a plotted Slickshot Show-Off , it becomes trivial to trigger flurry on successive turns. Each pair of spells you cast fuels a growing army of Monk tokens, while prowess amplifies their threat level turn by turn.\n\nOne of the few cards that can cleanly answer this explosive strategy is Temporary Lockdown , but even that's not a guaranteed solution thanks to main-deck copies of Spell Pierce . With this powerful configuration, Darthkid piloted Izzet Prowess to a 4th-place finish in a recent Magic Online Challenge, and many other players have found similar success with this hot new archetype.\n\nSunpearl Kirin Brings Bounce at Instant Speed\n\nSunpearl Kirin\n\n2 Adarkar Wastes 3 Caves of Koilos 4 Concealed Courtyard 4 Darkslick Shores 2 Entity Tracker 2 Fear of Isolation 1 Go for the Throat 4 Hopeless Nightmare 1 Momentum Breaker 4 Nowhere to Run 4 Nurturing Pixie 4 Optimistic Scavenger 2 Restless Anchorage 4 Seachrome Coast 3 Spiteful Hexmage 4 Stormchaser's Talent 4 Sunpearl Kirin 1 Swamp 4 This Town Ain't Big Enough 3 Underground River 1 Defiled Crypt // Cadaver Lab 2 Destroy Evil 2 Grim Bauble 1 Loran of the Third Path 2 No More Lies 3 Rest in Peace 2 Stock Up 2 The Witch's Vanity\n\nSunpearl Kirin has been adopted by Esper Pixie. While its stats are slightly weaker than Fear of Isolation , flash adds a new layer of flexibility. You can now hold up two mana, assess your opponent's play, and then respond with the best option—whether that's Nowhere to Run , This Town Ain't Big Enough , or another Kirin.\n\nEsper Pixie was already leaning heavily on a suite of self-bounce effects, and Sunpearl Kirin slots seamlessly into that framework. To make space, most lists have trimmed copies of Kaito, Bane of Nightmares and/or Stock Up . The self-bounce configuration of 4 This Town Ain't Big Enough , 4 Sunpearl Kirin , 4 Nurturing Pixie , and 2 Fear of Isolation has become the new norm. With that setup, HouseOfManaMTG took down a recent Standard Challenge on Magic Online.\n\nThe inclusion of the Kirin has also rippled through the rest of the deck. Entity Tracker has joined as a complementary flash threat, while Sunpearl Kirin 's synergy with Spiteful Hexmage —drawing a card when you bounce the Cursed Role—has prompted a resurgence of the black one-drop. The result is a leaner, more aggressive version of Esper Pixie, which remains a formidable force in the Standard format.\n\nTersa Lightshatter Ignites Mono-Red Aggro\n\n693607\n\n4 Burst Lightning 4 Emberheart Challenger 4 Heartfire Hero 4 Hired Claw 4 Lightning Strike 4 Manifold Mouse 4 Monstrous Rage 16 Mountain 4 Rockface Village 4 Screaming Nemesis 3 Soulstone Sanctuary 4 Tersa Lightshatter 1 Witchstalker Frenzy 2 Case of the Crimson Pulse 2 Lithomantic Barrage 4 Sunspine Lynx 4 Torch the Tower 3 Witchstalker Frenzy\n\nMuch like Screaming Nemesis , Tersa Lightshatter delivers three explosive points of hasty damage while offering the potential for lasting value. Early on, it helps filter your draws, letting you sculpt your hand to find the right mix of threats, lands, or instants. And later, when you hit the graveyard threshold, Tersa grants access to free cards—perhaps a game-ending Monstrous Rage .\n\nMany of the top-performing Mono-Red Aggro decks—including Latorretta's winning list from a recent Magic Online Challenge—have adopted multiple copies of Tersa, trimming Monastery Swiftspear to make room. Compared to pre-Tarkir: Dragonstorm builds, this version embraces a slightly higher curve and runs 23 lands, underlining a shift toward mid-game staying power.\n\nPersonally, I like the direction, but I believe there's still room for tuning. I'd consider shaving a copy each of Lightning Strike and Tersa Lightshatter in favor of Monastery Swiftspear and Sunspine Lynx . With a bit more optimization, we can get closer to perfection.\n\nDesperate Measures Adds Fuel for Leyline of Resonance\n\nDesperate Measures\n\n4 Blackcleave Cliffs 1 Blazemire Verge 4 Cacophony Scamp 4 Callous Sell-Sword 4 Desperate Measures 4 Emberheart Challenger 4 Heartfire Hero 4 Leyline of Resonance 4 Manifold Mouse 4 Might of the Meek 4 Monstrous Rage 11 Mountain 4 Sulfurous Springs 4 Turn Inside Out 4 Duress 4 Leyline of the Void 2 Pyroclasm 2 Sunspine Lynx 3 Torch the Tower\n\nAlthough Skullclamp is banned in several Constructed formats, Desperate Measures brings a similar effect to Standard. Of course, it's a one-shot effect rather than a repeatable engine. But what if you could use it twice?\n\nPaired with Leyline of Resonance , Desperate Measures starts to look more like its Equipment counterpart. Casting it in response to a removal spell lets you draw four cards for just one mana—an absurd exchange. And that's not the only trick. Want to push damage? Target your own Emberheart Challenger twice, then swing in with a 5/1 creature. Looking for value? Target your own Cacophony Scamp to draw cards and remove a creature.\n\nThese powerful interactions helped Bunnyfat clinch a victory at a recent Magic Online Challenge. Thanks to Tarkir: Dragonstorm, Leyline of Resonance strategies are not only viable again, but they're downright dangerous.\n\nHarmonize Shines in Jeskai Oculus\n\n693547\n\n4 Abhorrent Oculus 2 Adarkar Wastes 2 Battlefield Forge 1 Bitter Reunion 4 Fear of Missing Out 2 Glacial Dragonhunt 4 Helping Hand 4 Inspiring Vantage 4 Proft's Eidetic Memory 2 Recommission 4 Seachrome Coast 4 Shivan Reef 4 Spirebluff Canal 4 Spyglass Siren 4 Steamcore Scholar 2 Tersa Lightshatter 2 Thundering Falls 4 Torch the Tower 3 Winternight Stories 2 Chandra, Spark Hunter 3 Destroy Evil 2 Ghost Vacuum 1 Lithomantic Barrage 1 Negate 2 Pyroclasm 2 Spell Pierce 2 The Filigree Sylex\n\nTarkir: Dragonstorm introduces the harmonize mechanic, which lets you cast cards from your graveyard. It's a natural fit for decks already using draw-and-discard effects, such as Jeskai Oculus. Discarding a harmonize card early isn't a loss—it's an investment into the future. When those spells also help you loot, the synergy potential in Jeskai Oculus grows even larger.\n\nRubyXillia's version of Jeskai Oculus runs both Glacial Dragonhunt and Winternight Stories , which serve multiple roles. Not only can they be pitched to Fear of Missing Out or Steamcore Scholar , but they also power up Proft's Eidetic Memory and fill the graveyard for Helping Hand , Recommission , and Abhorrent Oculus . To make room for this new recursive graveyard potential, Inti, Seneschal of the Sun has gotten cut, but the resulting list is more consistent and explosive.\n\nNew Dragons Help Jeskai Decks Take Control\n\n693703\n\n1 Abrade 3 Beza, the Bounding Spring 1 Cori Mountain Monastery 1 Day of Judgment 2 Dispelling Exhale 3 Elegant Parlor 4 Floodfarm Verge 4 Get Lost 2 Island 4 Lightning Helix 3 Marang River Regent 3 Meticulous Archive 1 Mountain 3 Plains 1 Ride's End 3 Riverpyre Verge 4 Shiko, Paragon of the Way 1 Split Up 4 Stock Up 3 Sunbillow Verge 3 Temporary Lockdown 3 Three Steps Ahead 3 Thundering Falls 2 Authority of the Consuls 1 Beza, the Bounding Spring 1 Day of Judgment 1 Ghost Vacuum 2 Jace, the Perfected Mind 2 Kutzil's Flanker 2 Negate 2 Tishana's Tidebinder 2 Wilt-Leaf Liege\n\nControl decks aim to dictate the flow of the game by answering early threats and eventually pulling ahead with raw card advantage or late-game power. Two new Dragons from Tarkir: Dragonstorm offer exactly that, bolstering Jeskai Control as an archetype.\n\nLeading the charge is Shiko, Paragon of the Way , who provides value and flexibility. You can cast Stock Up for resources, Split Up to clear the board, or Get Lost to maintain control.\n\nMarang River Regent comes with an Omen spell, letting you keep mana up for either countermagic or card draw on your opponent's turn. And when you play it as a six-mana Dragon, it helps stabilize the board and go for the win.\n\nGerardo94 showcased the strength of this new core with a 3rd-place finish in a recent Magic Online Challenge. Their list also featured Dispelling Exhale , which functions like a supercharged No More Lies with a less demanding mana cost. Together, these additions provide a compelling new direction for control decks.\n\nElspeth Reinforces Token-Based Strategies\n\n693491\n\n2 Anoint with Affliction 3 Beza, the Bounding Spring 4 Bleachbone Verge 4 Caretaker's Talent 4 Carrot Cake 4 Concealed Courtyard 4 Cut Down 2 Day of Judgment 2 Demolition Field 2 Elspeth, Storm Slayer 1 Elspeth's Smite 4 Enduring Innocence 4 Fountainport 2 Get Lost 2 Go for the Throat 1 Kaya, Intangible Slayer 2 Overlord of the Mistmoors 5 Plains 4 Shadowy Backstreet 2 Sunfall 2 Swamp 2 Destroy Evil 3 Duress 1 Elspeth's Smite 1 Ghost Vacuum 2 Outrageous Robbery 1 Pest Control 2 The Stone Brain 3 Wilt-Leaf Liege\n\nIn a deck already built to flood the board with tokens, Elspeth, Storm Slayer is an Anointed Procession with loyalty abilities that offer even more versatility. In this version of Orzhov Tokens, piloted by Ivan_Draw_Go to a 5th-place finish in a recent Standard Challenge, Elspeth doubles down on what the deck does best.\n\nShe enhances a wide variety of token sources: Rabbit tokens from Carrot Cake , Treasure and Fish from Beza, the Bounding Spring and Fountainport , Insects from Overlord of the Mistmoors , and even her own Soldiers. With so many different token sources already bolstered by Caretaker's Talent , Elspeth's doubling effect compounds quickly.\n\nPlayers are debating whether to splash black for Cut Down or to remain mono-white for Lay Down Arms , but those are minor questions. What's clear is that Elspeth, Storm Slayer elevates this archetype to new heights, providing a dominant win condition that fits seamlessly into the existing game plan.\n\nJeskai Revelation Simplifies the Omniscience Win\n\n693676\n\n4 Abuelo's Awakening 4 Adarkar Wastes 2 Blast Zone 2 Chart a Course 3 Confounding Riddle 3 Ephara's Dispersal 1 Fabled Passage 4 Fallaji Archaeologist 4 Floodfarm Verge 3 Invasion of Arcavios 4 Island 4 Meticulous Archive 4 Moment of Truth 4 Omniscience 1 Oracle of Tragedy 2 Plains 3 Seachrome Coast 4 Stock Up 4 Temporary Lockdown 1 Beza, the Bounding Spring 1 Day of Judgment 2 Disenchant 2 Get Lost 2 Grand Abolisher 1 Jeskai Revelation 2 Negate 3 Riptide Gearhulk 1 Spell Pierce\n\nThe last new standout card worth spotlighting, Jeskai Revelation , looks like a sideboard card, but it plays a surprisingly central role in Azorius Omniscience . Its key function is to streamline the deck's win condition. After reanimating Omniscience with Abuelo's Awakening , the deck can cast Invasion of Arcavios , grab Jeskai Revelation from the sideboard, and begin a loop. Bounce Invasion, deal 4 damage to the opponent, recast Invasion, and repeat.\n\nIn previous iterations, the combo finish relied on a clunky sequence with Johann's Stopgap , This Town Ain't Big Enough , and Haunt the Network . Now, Jeskai Revelation offers a one-card kill loop, the win is cleaner and the sideboard has opened up. Freed from needing multiple pieces, the sideboard now has room for more utility cards like additional copies of Disenchant .\n\nWhat's Next for Standard?\n\nThe arrival of Cori-Steel Cutter and other game-changing cards from Tarkir: Dragonstorm has shaken up the Standard format. But we're still only scratching the surface. The coming weeks promise a thrilling period of discovery, as new archetypes emerge and top-tier strategies are refined across high-stakes competition.\n\nHere's the schedule for the upcoming Regional Championship cycle:\n\nIf you're eager to witness high-level Standard play in action, don't miss the Ultimate Guard European Magic Series Regional Championship in Bologna, Italy, on April 25–26!\n\nFanfinity will provide live video coverage on both Twitch and YouTube, featuring high production value, awesome features, and insightful commentary from seasoned champions.
