            "content": "Designed in US, made in China: Why Apple is stuck\n\n1 day ago Share Save Annabelle Liang Business reporter Reporting from Singapore Share Save\n\nGetty Images To leave or not to leave? China, home to more than a billion consumers, is Apple's second-largest market\n\nEvery iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California. While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports. Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market. Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week. But the comfort is short-lived. The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\". The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability. The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?\n\nHow a lifeline became a threat\n\nChina has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation. Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers. Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.\n\nGetty Images Apple's first store in China opened on 19 July 2008, in Beijing in the Sanlitun entertainment district\n\nIt wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones. As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory. Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping. He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says. Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door. As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\". For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick. Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras. Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia. \"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's CEO Tim Cook said in an interview last year.\n\nGetty Images Happier days: Apple CEO Tim Cook at a conference in Beijing. Mr Cook has visited China and met President Xi Jinping several times\n\nThe tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?\n\nIn Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China. But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead. \"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\" She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\" But many are sceptical of that.\n\nThe thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board. He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option. Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output. \"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\" Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".\n\nGetty Images China's unrivalled supply chain is a major draw for foreign manufacturers like Foxconn\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nAny change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic. Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade. \"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant. It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US. There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though. And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out. \"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says. So what does Apple do now?\n\nGetty Images First day of in-store sales at Apple's store in Guangzhou in September 2024"

            "description": "“We have adjusted exports from the U.S. to China in light of the current tariffs,” Ford spokesperson Robyn Jackson said in a statement.",
            "content": "Ford Motor Co. has adjusted shipments to China from the United States as a result of retaliatory tariffs, the Dearborn automaker confirmed.\n\nCiting anonymous sources, The Wall Street Journal first reported the Blue Oval this week halted shipments completely of F-150 Raptor pickups, Mustang muscle cars and Bronco SUVs built in Michigan, as well as Lincoln Navigator SUVs made in Kentucky in response to tariffs as high as 150%.\n\n“We have adjusted exports from the U.S. to China in light of the current tariffs,” Ford spokesperson Robyn Jackson said in a statement, without stating which models have been affected.\n\nFord does import the Lincoln Nautilus SUV into the United States from China. Shipments of that vehicle, however, continue, Jackson confirmed.\n\nThe United States and China have traded tariff escalations. China has raised its duties on imported U.S. goods to 125% from 84%. Meanwhile, the United States has imposed a 125% \"reciprocal\" tariff, though that number was imposed initially by the United States; a 20% tariff imposed over the fentanyl drug trade; and tariffs under Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act on certain goods between 7.5% and 100%.\n\nTrump's on-again, off-again tariff policy in general has prompted automakers and suppliers to scramble to learn the latest information and limit fallout. Analysts and auto executives have said the increased costs from the import taxes will cut into profits, risk supply chain disruptions, and increase vehicle prices.\n\n\"This is the shot across the bow to the White House: They're saying, 'We don’t know the rules of the game, and this is what we have to do for our business,'\" said Daniel Ives, analyst at wealth advisory firm Wedbush Securities Inc. \"They had to make this move because the tariff situation is untenable. I’d expect GM and others could follow suit. It’s just the beginning. Ford is being preemptive, and it's smart to be cautious in these unprecedent times.\"\n\nGM spokesperson Kevin Kelly said the Detroit automaker on Friday didn't have any changes to report on its business in China.\n\nLast year, Ford shipped about 5,500 Broncos, F-150s, Mustangs and Navigators to China. These \"passion products\" of Ford's lineup represent small volumes in China's highly fragmented market, but because it's the largest market in the world, those sales add up on profitable nameplates, Ford executives have said.\n\n\"They probably decided it’s too cost prohibitive right now and they are probably hoping a tariff deal gets worked out,\" David Whiston, analyst at financial services firm Morningstar Inc., said in an email. \"The vehicles they ship over there are primarily more for wealthy Chinese consumers due to their high-end price points and not a core part of their China strategy.\"\n\nThe automaker sold 400,000 vehicles in China last year, which represents falling sales as the market has become more competitive from domestic players. Ford does manufacture there with partners Changan Automobile Co. Ltd. and parent Jiangling Motors Co. Ltd. But it uses those factories mostly for exports to southeast Asia and South America.\n\n\"The best days for China and Ford are in the rearview mirror,\" Ives said about the effect halting shipments could have on the company's business in China. \"It's already been a challenging market. China is a lose-lose situation for Ford, just given tariffs, retaliation and just the Rubix cube they're trying to figure out in the U.S.\"\n\nFord Vice Chair John Lawler this week said operating profit from China was about $900 million last year, and he emphasized the company's commitment to remaining a global player.\n\n“Because of the competitive nature of where the Chinese are heading, they're looking to dominate around the world,\" he said. \"And if we get pushed back into just operating here in the United States and being a U.S. automaker, you know, large profit, but where does that put us as a company in 10 to 15 years?\n\n“We have to compete,” he continued. “And we have to learn to compete globally against the best that are out there, and that's what we’re doing.”\n\nbnoble@detroitnews.com\n\nX: @BreanaCNoble"

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar.\n\nCurrencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S.\n\nThe dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged.\n\nREAD MORE: What is the bond market, and why does it matter for the economy?\n\n“Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.”\n\nSince mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9 percent against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years.\n\nMany investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost.\n\nWith much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living.\n\nDollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others.\n\nNow that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk.\n\nDollar drop is odd\n\n“The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.”\n\nTraditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products.\n\nBut the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5 percent against the euro and pound, and 6 percent against the yen since early April.\n\nAs any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too.\n\nAnd any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk.\n\nFederal debt troubles\n\nMore worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120 percent of U.S. annual economic output.\n\n“Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ”\n\nThey already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival.\n\nChina has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort.\n\nAnother possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies.\n\nSaid BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.”\n\nNot everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S.\n\nSteve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand.\n\n“The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.”\n\nErratic policy spooks investors\n\nMaybe so, but Trump is testing the limits.\n\nIt’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money.\n\nThere are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!”\n\nEconomists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled.\n\nBerkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful.\n\n“This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.”"

            "description": "Mark Zuckerberg’s emails fretting about how to stop rivals like Instagram from catching Facebook are powerful evidence at the FTC’s antitrust trial – and the case could ultimately hinge on whether …",
            "content": "Mark Zuckerberg’s private emails about Facebook’s purchase of Instagram more than a decade ago came back to haunt Meta at its historic antitrust trial this week – and the outcome of the case could ultimately hinge on whether a judge buys his attempts to explain them away, experts told The Post.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission presented a series of explosive private messages, including a 2012 exchange in which Zuckerberg said buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor” — a turn of phrase that FTC lead attorney Daniel Matheson labeled a “smoking gun”.\n\nIn another 2018 message, the tech tycoon mused on whether Meta should “consider the extreme step of spinning Instagram out” to get ahead of regulators.\n\n“As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps Whatsapp in the next 5-10 years anyway,” Zuckerberg said in the 2018 document.\n\n6 Mark Zuckerberg was grilled for three straight days at the FTC trial. REUTERS\n\nThe FTC, which wants to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, has argued that Zuckerberg’s emails are proof of the company’s use of a “buy or bury” strategy to crush upstart apps before they could pose a legitimate threat to its social media empire. Zuckerberg was the first witness called to the stand on Monday and faced a grilling for three straight days.\n\nZuckerberg’s private emails “represent the strongest part of the government’s case,” according to Rebecca Haw Allensworth, an antitrust law expert and professor at Vanderbilt Law School.\n\n“I do think this is a dark cloud that will follow Meta – at least through this whole proceeding, which could take several years,” Allensworth added.\n\nThe candid messages provide a rare glimpse behind the mask for a notoriously buttoned-up Zuckerberg – and antitrust experts have long considered them to be some of the most damning evidence of Meta’s anticompetitive tactics. As far back as 2019, The Post reported that FTC had obtained a “spectacular document” as it weighed whether to challenge Meta’s acquisitions.\n\n6 The FTC has leaned heavily on Zuckerberg’s private emails to build its case. Getty Images\n\nAside from during Zuckerberg’s questioning, the emails were heavily featured during the FTC’s opening argument accusing Meta of having an illegal monopoly. US Judge James Boasberg of the Eastern District of Virginia will decide the outcome of the non-jury trial.\n\nThe company bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for about $19 billion in 2014.\n\nThe FTC showed a 2011 email in which Zuckerberg told an underling that Facebook was “getting our ass kicked” by Instagram. Later, in 2012, Zuckerberg worried that “lnstagram could hurt us meaningfully” and was “pretty threatening to us.”\n\n“Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp, Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion,” Zuckerberg said in another November 2012 email to then-Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.\n\n6 Kevin Huff (R), attorney for Meta Platforms, departs from the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Court House on April 16, 2025 in Washington, DC. Getty Images\n\nIn a 2013 email, Zuckerberg grumbled that he was “disappointed and frustrated” that Snap co-creator Evan Spiegal had turned down a $6 billion acquisition offer.\n\nOther emails showed Zuckerberg mulling a WhatsApp acquisition due to the potential risk that a rival messaging apps like China-based WeChat were “trying to build social networks and replace us.” Other Facebook executives privately worried that Google would beat Facebook to the punch and buy WhatsApp first.\n\nZuckerberg, meanwhile, denied that the emails showed anticompetitive intent and were instead as a sign of his constant paranoia that competitors would beat Facebook. At one point, he described seeing TikTok as a “highly urgent” threat to Meta as it gained popularity in 2019.\n\n“What’s that Andy Grove quote? ‘Only the paranoid survive,’” Zuckerberg said in a reference to the former CEO of Intel. “It’s my job to understand things that are adjacent to us and what’s going on in the industry.”\n\n6 Meta said the FTC’s case “ignores reality.” Getty Images\n\nReferring to his 2018 email about a possible preemptive Instagram spinoff, Zuckerberg said he needed to “take into account the direction that the politics seemed to be going at the time” as his company faced pressure on Capitol Hill.\n\nOn Instagram itself, Zuckerberg argued that his takeover helped rather than hurt its growth, which may never have occurred without Facebook’s backing.\n\nThe FTC has argued that Meta is dominant over a narrow market for social media companies that are built on friends-and-family connections, with Snapchat as its only direct competitor. Other apps like video-focused TikTok are in separate categories, according to the agency.\n\nZuckerberg and Meta’s attorneys have pushed back, insisting that Meta faces fierce competition from TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s iMessage for user attention. On the stand, Zuckerberg said Meta has focused less and less on its friends-and-family origins over time.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the FTC’s case “ignores reality.”\n\n6 Mark Zuckerberg lobbied President Trump to settle the FTC case before it went to trial. Xavier Collin/Image Press Agency / SplashNews.com\n\n“More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “It’s absurd that the FTC is trying to break up a great American company at the same time the Administration is trying to save Chinese-owned TikTok.”\n\nThe case will likely turn on which definition of Meta’s market is determined by the judge to be more accurate.\n\n“The market definition and monopoly power issues are huge and unless the government can succeed there, they cannot win,” added Allensworth. “On that front, Zuckerberg did well painting his company as being very focused on competition and in portraying the chaos of innovation and start-ups.”\n\nDespite his denials, Zuckerberg took steps to avoid the trial entirely – including making at least three trips to the White House while trying to convince President Trump to settle the case.\n\nEarlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Zuckerberg had offered a scant $450 million to settle the case – a fraction of the $30 billion sought by FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson.\n\n6 FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson reportedly rejected Zuckerberg’s settlement offers. Getty Images\n\n“FTC attorneys did a great job exposing the monopoly strategy Meta has had for years,” a former FTC official who recently left the agency and requested anonymity to discuss the case told The Post. “These emails indicate a clear intent to buy off potential competitors and real internal concern with the legal implications of these anticompetitive decisions.”\n\nAntitrust advocates say Zuckerberg’s testimony and the emails themselves, aside from playing a key role in the FTC case, will have wide-ranging repercussions as Meta faces ongoing scrutiny from Congress and federal regulators.\n\n“These emails are smoking-gun evidence that Mark Zuckerberg knowingly gobbled up competitors to smother threats before they emerged. Meta deserves to get the book thrown at them for breaking the law,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of The Tech Oversight Project.\n\n“This trial has already been an embarrassment for Meta, and it should come as no surprise why Zuckerberg was trying to convince Trump to call the whole thing off,” Haworth added."

            "description": "If you think it's all bird flu, think again.",
            "content": "This is part of Egg, an attempt to explain why Americans have absolutely lost their minds over egg prices.\n\nYou are probably familiar with the story going around about the egg shortage: The United States is in the midst of an outbreak of the highly contagious avian flu. Millions of hens across the country have been wiped out, greatly curtailing the number of eggs in the supply chain. That’s what led to the $12 cartons, totally barren egg sections at the grocery store, surcharges applied to the omelets at Waffle House, and—if we’re being honest—the reelection of Donald Trump under a storm of consumer outrage.\n\nThat all makes sense on one level, but Angela Huffman, head of Farm Action—a nonprofit that campaigns against the corporatization of the food system—believes there’s something fishier going on. Maybe, she said, the avian flu is an easy scapegoat for what’s really happening. Maybe the nation’s largest egg producers are using this opportunity to turn a fortune off of breakfast. So Huffman, and her organization, started investigating.\n\n“We had noticed that egg prices had gone up, but at the same time, the largest producers had their profits going up drastically,” Huffman told me. “We thought, OK, if they just needed to raise prices to account for the losses of their hens due to the flu, why are they making five times more money?’ That was really odd to us.”\n\nAccording to Farm Action’s research, there is evidence that the avian flu’s impact on egg production hasn’t been quite as pervasive as consumers might think. Despite the wipeout infestations and mass euthanizing, Farm Action alleges the size of egg-laying flocks in 2025 are, on average, only about 5 percent smaller, on a month-to-month basis, than they were in 2021. (Other reports put that number closer to 10 percent.) This is especially true for Cal-Maine Foods, the agribusiness giant responsible for 20 percent of the American egg supply. Huffman alleges that Cal-Maine has continued to churn out the same 1.1 billion eggs, year after year, despite the flu. Yet Cal-Maine’s revenue has skyrocketed. Per a report in the Guardian, the company’s profits tripled this quarter compared to the same time frame last year, and in total, its margins have grown nearly 800 percent since the winter of 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Put another way, Cal-Maine has made more in a single quarter than they made in an entire year prior to the 2022 avian flu outbreak,” the group said. In fact, they made so much that the company is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice for alleged price fixing, resulting in a 4 percent drop in its stock. “Egg producers and grocery stores may leverage the current avian flu outbreak as an opportunity to further constrain supply or hike up egg prices to increase profits,” a group of Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, wrote in an open letter in January, according to the New York Times. A 2011 lawsuit alleging price fixing by some of the same egg producers resulted in a jury finding against the producers in 2023.\n\nThe company didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment, but according to the Guardian’s investigation, Cal-Maine’s financial documents maintain that its production lines have negligible effect on consumer expenses. (“We do not sell eggs directly to consumers or set the prices at which eggs are sold to consumers,” it said.) There might be some truth to that: As David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University, told me, egg producers generally set their prices based on the research conducted by various analytics firms that evaluate the supply and demand in the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of those analytics companies is Urner Barry, which has run into controversy over its pricing apparatus in the past. Case in point: In 2020, the state of New York referenced Urner Barry in a lawsuit focused on price fixing during the pandemic, alleging that wholesale producers “use Urner Barry’s indexed prices as justification to set their own prices for the sale of eggs,” no matter how expensive they might be. (A spokesperson at Urner Barry has pushed back against those claims, telling the Guardian, in part, that “buyers and sellers are always free to transact at different prices.” “We do not set prices. We simply observe and report what is happening ,” the company told me. “There is pretty universal consensus that the recent sharp rise in prices is primarily down to bird flu.”)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his part, Ortega thinks Cal-Maine may have gotten lucky and is enjoying a windfall. “It’s not surprising to me that Cal-Maine is reporting record profits, because even when prices rise, people still buy eggs,” he said. “The company’s facilities house a lot of birds. And if you haven’t been hit with an outbreak, while you’re still facing some costs with biosecurity and things like that, you could benefit from those higher prices. That doesn’t just apply to Cal-Maine, that applies to any supplier in the business.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJadrian Wooten, another food economist who teaches at Virginia Tech, added, “The very easy answer here is that during a shortage, if Cal-Maine doesn’t increase the price of their eggs, they’re going to have very cheap eggs, and people are going to buy way too many of those eggs. All of a sudden it will be harder for anyone to get eggs. Higher prices help allocate scarce resources.”\n\n“It’s a symptom of a larger issue: the consolidation of our food sector into just a few hands,” Huffman told me. “These companies have a history of using any sort of supply chain disruption to price gouge consumers.”\n\nUnfortunately for us, this is unlikely to change anytime soon. Eggs are what’s known as “inelastic” products, meaning that rising prices don’t necessarily decrease consumption. As the Food & Water Watch report points out, 97 percent of U.S. households buy eggs, and have continued to do so in spite of prices that are often twice as high. Whether these price hikes come from normal market fluctuations or something more untoward, there’s little incentive for companies to stop that gravy train."

            "content": "How FDA cuts could make the food and drug supply less safe\n\ntoggle caption Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWhen Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in March that he would eliminate thousands of jobs from federal health agencies, he promised that he would spare the inspectors who keep America's food and drugs safe by scrutinizing factories around the world.\n\nKennedy kept his word and didn't fire inspectors, but key support staffers who handled travel arrangements, reimbursements and more are gone, according to two current inspectors who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to the media.\n\nSome of the support staffers were asked to come back temporarily. But last week, they were told to go home again, the current inspectors said.\n\nThat loss of support could make it much harder to inspect factories producing things like baby formula, eye drops, cinnamon and a range of generic drugs, all of which have had manufacturing problems that led to recalls in recent years. In some cases, people were injured or died.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"That is America's first line of defense for the safety of their food and their drugs,\" said a current pharmaceutical inspector.\n\nIn response to questions from NPR, HHS said in a statement: \"The FDA is monitoring inspectional travel and ensuring necessary support is in place to continue these functions.\"\n\nShift of trip planning slows down inspections\n\nBut some inspectors are canceling their trips because of the staff cuts. A food and animal feed inspector who wasn't authorized to speak publicly told NPR they're still waiting to be reimbursed for thousands of dollars in recent inspection-related travel expenses. \"I don't trust the process,\" the inspector said.\n\nFDA staffers received an email on April 7 telling them they would be responsible for their own travel arrangements from now on, offering office hours for people who need help. Inspectors say it's not that simple.\n\n\"International travel is extremely complicated,\" said the food and feed inspector. \"Some countries require visas, others don't. The coordinators maintained a master list and helped process visa paperwork. While I was doing inspections, they kept everything moving behind the scenes.\"\n\nA March 11 email to FDA staff says the administration lowered government employee credit card limits to $1. Now to book travel, inspectors need prior approval to get the credit limit raised. The drug inspector said the administrator they had emailed for authorization had been laid off. \"It's hard to believe the work is actually going to get done,\" the inspector said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nInspections were already falling short of goals\n\nThe reduced support for inspectors could exacerbate long-standing problems.\n\nAccording to a recent Government Accountability Office report, staffing problems caused the FDA to conduct fewer drug inspections in 2023 than it did before the COVID-19 pandemic, when such inspections were paused. \"Since resuming inspections, FDA has struggled to retain staff,\" the report said. \"From Nov. 2021 to June 2024, the vacancy rate among investigators who inspect foreign and domestic manufacturers jumped from 9% to 16% — leading to fewer inspections.\" Concerns about pay and work-life balance contributed to turnover, the report said.\n\nThe agency also hasn't met its goals for foreign or domestic food inspections since 2018, according to another GAO report.\n\nPeter Baker, who spent 10 years as an FDA drug inspector before leaving in 2019, said not being able to inspect facilities especially in countries like China and India is a \"really big deal.\"\n\n\"It matters a lot because most of our generic products are made in areas of the world that are semi-regulated or unregulated,\" said Baker, who now runs a consulting firm called Live Oak Quality Assurance. \"So the only outside eyes that are going to look at the quality system that is backing these drugs that these patients are eventually going to take is the FDA investigator. They may be the only person with an independent lens who's going to look at the conditions under which these products are manufactured.\"\n\nFor instance, during a two-week inspection of a drug factory in India that ended last September, FDA inspectors observed inadequate cleaning of equipment, problems with air handling systems (including bird droppings and feathers on air purification units) and 15 waste bags containing torn quality records, according to an agency warning letter made public in March. The company, Granules India Limited, did not respond to NPR's request for comment.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nInternational trips take extra support\n\nThe laid-off support staffers used to handle air travel, hotels and ground transportation — all for inspectors' trips around the world. \"This was a full-time job for someone for a reason — it's a ton of work,\" the food and feed inspector said.\n\n\"It appears that this is going to slow down the ability of inspectors to get their work done,\" said Baker. \"The quality of inspections is inevitably going to go down, which is a sad situation for public health. And I think overall, the patients that are most vulnerable, which is generally young children and older people, are going to bear the consequences of this.\"\n\nInternational inspection trips typically last three weeks, involve multiple facilities and cost more than $10,000, the current inspectors and Baker told NPR. Sometimes, that's the cost of the airfare alone.\n\nEntire trips go on government credit cards in the inspectors' names. If the government doesn't reimburse them promptly, the inspectors worry about having to pay the steep bills themselves.\n\n\"It's very stressful,\" said Baker. \"They're probably going to have to take out loans from family members or maybe even from a bank to be able to fulfill their obligations on those credit cards if those expense report payments are delayed.\"\n\nThe uncertainty is a problem because the FDA was already short-staffed and has trouble attracting and keeping people who can make more money in the private sector.\n\nChris Middendorf, who spent most of his more than two decades at the FDA as an inspector, said if inspectors now need to spend at least a week handling trip logistics themselves, that's time they can't be writing up previous inspection reports, learning about new technologies and preparing for their next inspection. \"So it's all just going to slow down the inspection process.\"\n\nMiddendorf, who is now senior director of pharmaceutical and biotech compliance at the law firm Hogan Lovells, said in-person inspections remain the gold standard for assuring quality. When it comes to drugs, the biggest risk factor in contamination is human error.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"What you don't want to see are basically operators touching [their faces], messing around with their mask by touching things with their hands they shouldn't be,\" he said, explaining that these errors can cause bacteria to get into sterile products. \"But the only way you can see them is by standing outside the production window and watching for hours.\""

A CBS News poll released Sunday found 44% of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, down 4% from an earlier March survey.\n\nRepublicans in the Lehigh Valley flipped the local congressional seat in last year’s elections, and national Democrats have already said they will target the district in next year’s midterm campaign.\n\n“Trump’s delusional and destructive tariffs are costing families in my region their livelihoods!” State Rep. Josh Siegel, a Lehigh County Democrat, wrote on X Thursday night. “Tariffs aren’t saving American industry, they’re raising costs on all families, destroying our economy, and creating uncertainty for families and businesses!”\n\nTrump at the White House on Thursday said he’s in “no rush” to negotiate trade deals with other countries, the Associated Press reported, adding that “tariffs are making us rich.”\n\nMack was founded in 1900 and since 2000 has been a subsidiary of Swedish multinational Volvo. Mack says all trucks destined for the U.S. and Canada are assembled at American plants. But the company also imports parts and materials — including steel and aluminum — from “a number of countries,” Pupillo said.\n\nTrump has imposed 25% levies on all foreign steel and aluminum products, as well as a 25% tax on auto imports. Other goods face a baseline 10% import tax, while the White House said Tuesday that tariffs on Chinese exports are as high as 245% for some goods.\n\nIn addition to the domestic market, Mack exports U.S.-built trucks to other countries, meaning the company could face higher costs from retaliatory tariffs imposed by foreign governments, though many have held off on doing so as they seek to ease tensions with the Trump administration.\n\nTim Hertzog, shop chairman for United Auto Workers Local 677, said he met with the company Thursday. “Due to the market being in decline, there will be a rate and line reduction,” he wrote in a letter to union members that was posted on Facebook.\n\nIn addition to the Pennsylvania cuts, Mack plans to lay off up to 100 workers at a factory in Hagerstown, Md., according to trade publication FreightWaves.\n\nThe trucking industry is grappling with a variety of headwinds.\n\nNorth American net orders of Class 8 heavy-duty trucks fell to 15,700 units in March, down 22% from the year-earlier period, according to FTR Transportation Intelligence, a freight forecasting firm.\n\n“The implementation and continued threat of tariffs among North American trading partners combined with ongoing economic and freight market uncertainty have significantly dampened fleet investment in Class 8 trucks and tractors in recent months,” the firm said in an analysis.\n\nAbout 40% of heavy-duty trucks sold in the U.S. are imported from Canada and Mexico, according to S&P Global."

But there’s also a risk that they could face higher credit card interest rates.\n\nCompared to other major credit card issuers, Capital One has historically catered to customers with credit scores in the 600s range, which is considered subprime. Given these borrowers are considered riskier, they tend to get charged higher interest rates compared to higher-scoring individuals.\n\nIn signing off on the deal, the Fed announced it entered into a consent order with Discover and charged Discover a $100 million penalty “for overcharging certain interchange fees from 2007 through 2023.”\n\nUnder the Biden administration, the prospects of the deal receiving approval from the Department of Justice were much slimmer, given the administration’s overall antitrust stance.\n\nBut the Trump administration has largely been seen as being much more merger friendly. Immediately after President Donald Trump’s November victory last year, shares of Capital One and Discover rose, as well as shares of other companies that were attempting to merge — or which had previously called off deals altogether."

Its tagline, \"Shop like a billionaire,\" is inextricably linked to the affordability of items on its platform. And although Shein—which vows to make global fashion \"accessible to all\" by selling inexpensive stylish clothing—moved its headquarters from China to Singapore in 2022, most of its products are still controversially manufactured in China, the BBC reported.\n\nFor weeks, the US-China trade war has seen both sides spiking tariffs. In the US, the White House last night crunched the numbers and confirmed that China now faces tariffs of up to 245 percent, The Wall Street Journal reported. That figure includes new tariffs Trump has imposed, taxing all Chinese goods by 145 percent, as well as prior 100 percent tariffs lobbed by the Biden administration that are still in effect on EVs and Chinese syringes.\n\nLast week, China announced that it would stop retaliations, CNBC reported. But that came after China rolled out 125 percent tariffs on US goods. While China has since accused Trump of weaponizing tariffs to \"an irrational level,\" other retaliations have included increasingly cutting off US access to critical minerals used in tech manufacturing and launching antitrust probes into US companies.\n\nFor global retailers, the tit-for-tat tariffs have immediately scrambled business plans. Particularly for Temu and Shein, Trump's decision to end the “de minimis” exemption on May 2—which allowed shipments valued under $800 to be imported duty-free—will soon hit hard, exposing them to 90 percent tariffs that inevitably led to next week's price shifts. According to The Guardian, starting on June 1, retailers will have to pay $150 tariffs on each individual package."

            "content": "Tariffs threaten to push auto insurance rates even higher\n\ntoggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nA slew of new tariffs, including some specific to vehicles, have many Americans reassessing their plans to buy a car — moving them up to take advantage of today's tariff-free pricing , or reevaluating whether they want a new car at all, given the economic uncertainty.\n\nPresident Trump has recently floated the idea of a temporary pause on the 25% tax on imported cars, as a reprieve for automakers.\n\nBut even if he goes ahead with that idea, tariffs will still affect the auto industry. And deciding not to purchase a new car won't fully insulate drivers from price changes, either.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat's because tariffs are pushing up the prices of parts — so the cost of maintenance and repairs are also poised to rise. And when repairing cars gets more expensive, so does something else: auto insurance.\n\n\"These tariffs are going to affect everybody who owns and operates a car,\" says Jessica Caldwell, the head of insights at the automotive data company Edmunds.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs will rise\n\nRight now, there's a 25% tariff on imported new cars . There's also a plan to impose a 25% tariff on at least some imported car parts, although the details aren't finalized yet and that is not yet in effect. (Changes to one or both of those tariffs may be what Trump had in mind when he told reporters on April 14 that he was \"looking at something to help some of the car companies.\")\n\nBut other tariffs are also affecting car parts, including tariffs on steel and aluminum , and a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, as well as a 25% tariff on goods imported from Canada and Mexico that don't meet the requirements of the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) trade deal.\n\nLaurent Spence works at a NAPA auto parts shop in Desert Hot Springs, Calif., and rattles off some of the high-turnover products that are already being affected by tariffs. Brake pads from Mexico. Brake rotors from China. Suspension parts from Turkey and Thailand. Tools from Taiwan.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSpence says he used to update about 20 prices a week on the store shelves, many of those markdowns for sales. Now, he says, he's swapping out prices \"every day\" — and most of them are trending up.\n\nSeeing the trend, Spence has taken advantage of his employee discount and started to stock up on parts for his own vehicles, which are older and need a lot of work. \"Belts, ball joints, control arms,\" he says. \"I'm just kind of stockpiling on nearly everything that I will need in the future as a just-in-case.\" (He bought up coffee beans, too.)\n\nWhether you do your own work or take your car to a shop, when the price of parts goes up, it makes basic maintenance and any needed repairs more expensive .\n\nMagnify this hundreds of thousands of times, and that's the situation for auto insurers. If every single repair becomes more expensive, so does their overall cost of doing business.\n\nInsurance premiums will eventually be pushed up\n\nIf insurers have to pay more for repairs, they're going to charge more in premiums.\n\nInsurance is, fundamentally, a way of spreading costs out among a big pool of people. As a result, even if you aren't personally in a crash, your premiums will go up to reflect the higher cost of replacing bumpers and doing bodywork.\n\nThat's true even if you have the bare minimum insurance, says Shannon Martin, an insurance expert at Bankrate.\n\n\"If you're someone with an older car and liability-only coverage, you might think, 'Well, my rate's going to stay the same.' But it won't,\" she says. \"You have property damage coverage on your policy that pays for someone else's vehicle … that is now going to cost more to fix.\"\n\nInsurance rates are already painfully high for many customers, averaging more than $2,600 annually for full coverage, according to Bankrate. Rates rose sharply after the pandemic caused supply chain disruptions in vehicle and parts production. Lower supply meant higher prices. After a year or two, insurance premiums soared, with year-over-year increases topping 20%.\n\nThose rate hikes were finally settling down. According to the latest Consumer Price Index data, released last week, insurance prices actually dropped slightly between February and March, and annual increases were back in pre-pandemic territory.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut the introduction of tariffs, Martin says, \"really kind of throws a monkey wrench into everything.\"\n\nDelays and uncertainty — and some evergreen advice\n\nDrivers shouldn't expect to see their premiums go up overnight. Insurance rates, as a rule, can't change as quickly as other prices do.\n\nCompanies need to assess their higher costs, and then negotiate with the state regulators who try to protect ratepayers from unreasonable hikes. Even after hikes get approved, your current rates are locked in until your policy renews.\n\nAnd then there's the caveat that the tariffs keep changing, with new additions and exemptions and reprieves.\n\nThat's complicating one of President Trump's stated goals for these tariffs, which is encouraging manufacturers to move to the United States. Companies say it's tricky to make plans for relocations when the rules keep changing.\n\nIt also makes it next to impossible to accurately forecast how much something like, say, auto insurance rates, will rise.\n\n\"Any numbers that people give you are just guesses that can change at any moment,\" says Martin, \"because everything's so unpredictable right now.\"\n\nIn these unpredictable times, some age-old advice is still reliable.\n\nSpence recommends having a trusted mechanic. Caldwell reminds drivers to shop around for their best rates. And Martin says the uncertainty about insurance rates is yet another good reason to be careful on the road. A good driving record will help keep your insurance rates low. Unlike tariffs, driving cautiously is something you can control."

            "content": "Shares of the U.S.-based Archer Aviation (ACHR) soared over 2% after the company announced an air taxi partnership in NYC with United Airlines (UAL). Through this partnership, the company aims to help New Yorkers bypass airport traffic by offering electric air taxi rides, cutting travel time from up to two hours to just 5-15 minutes.\n\nFlying Taxis in NYC?\n\nAs part of the latest deal, Archer Aviation plans to connect Manhattan with nearby airports using its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, Midnight. This four-passenger vehicle is designed to cut travel times from one-to-two-hour drives to just 5-15 minutes. Operating from Manhattan helipads, the service will shuttle customers to major airports like JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, and other smaller regional airports.\n\nArcher’s goal is to drastically reduce long, congested rides to NYC airports, providing a quicker, more efficient alternative. The company expressed optimism that it would obtain the required certifications by 2026, and it would provide an update on piloted flights during its next earnings call. Archer will release its Q1 2025 earnings report on May 8.\n\nMeanwhile, United Airlines will work closely with Archer Aviation to help build infrastructure needed to bring advanced air mobility to its customers.\n\nCertifications Before Takeoff\n\nArcher’s air taxi ambitions currently depend on certification approvals. The company’s flagship Midnight aircraft is still awaiting type certification from the U.S. aviation regulator. For context, type certification ensures that an aircraft meets the Federal Aviation Administration’s design and safety standards. Once Archer receives this certification, it will be able to start testing its planned routes.\n\nAdditionally, the company needs to get a pilot into one of its aircraft for a test flight. So far, the company has only conducted autonomous flights with no humans on board.\n\nIs Archer Aviation a Good Buy?\n\nOverall, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on ACHR stock based on six Buys, one Hold, and zero Sells assigned in the last three months. The average Archer Aviation share price target of $12.83 implies a 77.5% upside potential.\n\nSee more ACHR analyst ratings\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue"

YoY gains narrow sharply in San Diego, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Columbus… 20 below 2022 peaks.\n\nMarch is the time of the year – the spring selling season – when home prices in many markets rise sharply after declining during the winter, and they did so a year ago.\n\nBut this March, prices of single-family houses, condos, and co-ops across the US rose only 0.2% from February. A year ago, they’d jumped by 1.1% in March from February.\n\nThis small month-to-month price increase in March caused the year-over-year price gain for homes that sold in March to get whittled down to 1.1% overall, from 2.1% in February. A year ago, the YoY price gains were in 4.5% range. During the peak of Housing Bubble 2 in mid-2021, YoY gains exceeded 18%.\n\nSimilar scenarios played out in all of the 33 metros here: Month-to-month gains in March – if any… Miami and others had declines – were a lot smaller than a year earlier.\n\nThose markets with YoY price declines in February saw these YoY declines widen in March. Seven of those that still had YoY gains in February flipped to YoY declines in March. And others saw their YoY gains narrow, in some cases to near-nothing, such as San Diego.\n\nAll data here is from the “raw” mid-tier Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI). The ZHVI is based on millions of data points in Zillow’s “Database of All Homes,” including from public records (tax data), MLS, brokerages, local Realtor Associations, real-estate agents, and households across the US. It includes pricing data for off-market deals and for-sale-by-owner deals. Zillow’s Database of All Homes also has sales-pairs data. The index is not seasonally adjusted.\n\nThe 33 Most Splendid Housing Bubbles.\n\nHere we track the prices of single-family houses, condos, and co-ops in 33 large Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). To qualify for this list, the MSA must be one of the largest by population, and must have had a ZHVI of at least $300,000 somewhere along the line.\n\nThe metros of New Orleans, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, etc. don’t qualify for this list because their ZHVI has never reached $300,000, despite the massive surge of home prices in recent years, but from low levels.\n\nDown year-over-year: The group of the 33 metros here whose prices declined year-over-year keeps growing.

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s administration is taking control of the $7 billion reconstruction project for New York City’s busy but aging Penn Station, sidelining the city’s mass transit agency, the transportation chief said Thursday.\n\nState and city officials have sought for years to remake the country’s busiest rail hub, which is beleaguered by problems ranging from aging tracks to dreary commuter passageways.\n\nDepartment of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said his agency could deliver a world-class Penn Station by working with Amtrak, the federally chartered railroad company that owns the midtown Manhattan hub. Duffy said he was withdrawing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority as lead for the reconstruction project.\n\n“New York City deserves a Penn Station that reflects America’s greatness and is safe and clean. The MTA’s history of inefficiency, waste, and mismanagement also meant that a new approach is needed,” Duffy said in a prepared release.\n\nThe administration did not immediately provide details of how the reconstruction would proceed or how long it would take.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul called the move “a major victory for New Yorkers” that would save them tax money. Hochul said she had asked Trump for federal funding.\n\n“I want to thank the President and Secretary Duffy for taking on the sole responsibility to deliver the beautiful new $7 billion station that New Yorkers deserve,” Hochul said in a prepared release.\n\nAuthority Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said he was glad the federal government was focusing on the project, and that he expected the MTA to participate in the plans as the station’s major leaseholder.\n\nDuffy has recently clashed with the transit agency over crime on the city’s subways and the $9 congestion toll on drivers entering the most traffic-snarled parts of Manhattan. Federal authorities have set a Sunday deadline to end the congestion tolls."

            "content": "How tariffs could impact the availability of baby products\n\ntoggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIf you have – or have had – small children, chances are, you're familiar with Munchkin products. The company manufactures everything from sippy cups to bath toys, breast pumps to baby gates. Munchkin founder and CEO Steve Dunn recently wrote an open letter to President Trump and members of Congress about the harm new tariffs are doing to his business.\n\n\"These tariffs are having devastating real-life consequences,\" he wrote. \"These new tariffs are forcing us to halt orders, cut jobs and may soon prevent us from delivering essential baby products to parents nationwide.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe went on to say that \"due to the complete absence of necessary tooling and manufacturing expertise, automation, and skilled labor,\" Munchkin has been unable to bring production to the U.S.\n\nDunn spoke with All Things Considered host Mary Louise Kelly about why he wrote the letter, and the impact the tariffs on goods from China could have on his company.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\n\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nMary Louise Kelly: Briefly outline for me why tariffs pose such a threat to your company.\n\nSteve Dunn: Well, when the initial tariffs were implemented, most of the companies within the juvenile industry tried to absorb them. Now that the tariffs have increased to 145 percent, our industry and a lot of small businesses have just stopped ordering. And consumers – parents – will not find important juvenile products on the shelves.\n\nKelly: I'm just trying to get a picture in my head of what you're talking about. You're talking about products like strollers, products like baby gates, and you're saying you cannot keep making them if the current situation persists.\n\nDunn: Mary Louise, our whole industry has stopped ordering products from China due to the 145 percent tariffs. These are tariffs that just can't be passed on to two parents. You know, our birth rates are at the lowest levels in the last 40 years and making it more difficult and more expensive to be parents is going to even [exacerbate] that issue now.\n\nKelly: Stay with that point for a second, because in this open letter you write, and I'm quoting, \"if action is not taken soon, the damage will be irreversible, not only for our company, our employees, but countless businesses, workers and families across America.\" What is the damage you see being done to American families?\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDunn: The products they rely on – Munchkin operates in about 12 different categories of things from bottle brushes to bottles to a new product we launched that helps moms meet their breastfeeding goals. These products will not be on the shelves because our industry and millions of small businesses have simply stopped ordering. We will run out of inventory in the next 60 days, 90s days. And if we don't place orders now, any order we place now will take 45 days to get here.\n\nSo we're at a critical path where Munchkin owns thousands of tools in China. I can't even move my tools to the U.S. So moving and trying to relocate businesses like the juvenile industry or the maternal health industry into the U.S. would take years and years. It would take government-supported programs to create manufacturing zones. Just to manufacture our sippy cups would take 100 molding machines in the U.S. – if we could find them.\n\nKelly: If President Trump were on the line with us now, he might be arguing, \"hey, tariffs are going to bring manufacturing back to the United States. This is good for America. This is good for American workers.\" What do you say to that?\n\nDunn: I would say I wholeheartedly support the intent of onshoring strategic industries like semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and aerospace. But with respect to the juvenile industry and products that parents need everyday, we don't have $100 billion sitting in the bank. We have no ability and there is not this manufacturing base that is suddenly going to appear in the U.S. that can mold thousands and thousands of low-margin products. We don't have the automation. We don't have the skilled labor. So our industry is going to have layoffs. Our company has had a hiring freeze. We're not innovating. We can't find countries that don't have tariffs right now that make these products affordable for America, for the American public.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nKelly: Are you in conversation with other small, medium- sized business owners about a path forward?\n\nDunn: Yes, we're part of the Juvenile Products Manufacturing Association. I've talked with their general counsel. They're also petitioning the administration to look at an exemption or a carve-out for the juvenile industry due to the importance of supporting parents. In talking with other CEO leaders, everyone that I've talked to has stopped 100 percent of their orders coming in from China. That 145 percent on products will just be too expensive, and the consumers will not be able to pay for them.\n\n\n\nThis story was adapted for the web by Mallory Yu."

            "content": "Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang made a high-profile trip to Beijing this week following a sudden U.S. government move to block exports of the company’s H20 AI chips to China, The New York Times (NYT) reported.\n\nThe H20 — a chip Nvidia specifically designed to comply with earlier export restrictions — had become central to the company’s China strategy. But the policy reversal triggered a projected $5.5 billion revenue hit and a nearly 7% drop in Nvidia’s stock price as of Wednesday. Shares are down nearly 3% on Thursday.\n\nWhile in Beijing, Huang met with Chinese trade officials from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. According to Chinese state media, he emphasized Nvidia’s commitment to the market, saying the company would “spare no effort” to build compliant products and “unswervingly serve the Chinese market.”\n\nBack in Washington, however, Nvidia is facing rising scrutiny. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has launched an investigation into Nvidia’s chip sales across Asia, with a focus on whether the company violated export rules — particularly in relation to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which reportedly stockpiled tens of thousands of advanced chips.\n\nAs Wedbush Securities put it in a note Thursday morning, Nvidia and U.S. tech are now “caught in the eye of this Category 5 storm.” The firm called the chip ban the “first shots fired” in what could become a long and painful trade war between the U.S. and China. Analysts expect tech companies to offer little guidance this quarter, and Wedbush estimates 2025 forecasts will be cut by 7–10%.\n\nWhile the near-term financial damage may be considerable, the strategic risk is even greater. China brought in roughly $17 billion for Nvidia last year — over 19% of its total revenue. If access to that market evaporates, so does a key growth pillar.\n\nAnd with Washington turning up the heat and Beijing watching closely, Huang’s balancing act — between regulatory compliance and global expansion — just got significantly harder.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

The news has been accompanied by a lengthy, and often very funny, post-mortem on the series penned by its creators, including stars Laverne Cox and George Wallace and co-creator Dan Ewen. “This shit was cheaper than therapy,” they note up top, before diving into the work of making a comedy series centered on a Black trans woman living in the American South.\n\nThat includes what was apparently a lengthy initial meeting between Cox and Lear, who reportedly ended the conversation by noting “I’m almost a hundred years old. How have I just learned so much about something so important?” (“Some of Lear’s questions were too personal, some overly medical,” the piece continues. “Laverne’s retort, ‘That information is between me and my doctor and my boyfriend,’ would end up in the pilot script. But Norman’s questions were evidence of a mind that had remained open, decades after most people’s have welded shut.”)\n\nThe piece goes on to cover the show’s lengthy trip from genesis to actual airing, including landing at Freevee back before Freevee got absorbed into the larger streaming biomass. Ultimately, the show—which we enjoyed , for all that it sometimes felt like it took place in a reality at least modestly divorced from our own—arrived on TV in February 2025, right alongside the initial flurry of anti-trans moves by the just-installed Trump administration. Meanwhile, the writing for the series was already on the wall: “The series was met with much admiration,” Cox, Wallace, and Ewen write. “We went on the shows, bantering with Whoopi, Kelly, Seth, and others. We presented at the Image Awards and were showered with love. We enjoyed promising domestic numbers, especially with the African American audience. Critics called it ‘A tall glass of sweet tea,’ ‘Norman Lear’s parting gift,’ and a ‘show we need now more than ever.’ But by the time audiences saw Laverne’s epic trip down Jennifer Hudson’s dance line, Clean Slate was already toast. What? Guuuuuurl.”\n\nWhile saying “Of course, we mourn our baby,” the show’s producers also expressed their interest in trying to find ways to continue its story. “We will be conducting a folksy awards campaign, so keep your eyes peeled for our bake sale. “For Yo’ Momma’s Consideration” ads are being prepared. Conversations will continue about where and how Desiree and Harry’s journey might continue. We would love to further the echo of Norman’s voice. We will push to keep the story alive, for the sake of the kind of people portrayed in it, the kind of people being legislated out of existence, or erased from history books. It feels like it’s time to fight like hell for nice things. And whatnot.”"

            "description": "As \"Pride and Prejudice\" celebrates 20 years, director Joe Wright and production designer Sarah Greenwood discuss their experiences shooting the film.",
            "content": "In the 2005 film adaptation of “Pride and Prejudice,” the central love story between Elizabeth and Darcy is set in motion during a ball. It’s a rowdy, exuberant scene full of carefree dancing and whispered observations about the other attendees.\n\nThat’s also director Joe Wright‘s favorite scene. Not too long ago, Wright rewatched his debut feature, which Focus Features is bringing back to theaters this weekend in recognition of the film’s 20th anniversary. “The first ball, the community dance, I’m very proud of that scene. It has a kind of energy and a vitality and a messiness and joy,” Wright tells Variety.\n\nIn the scene, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) first spots Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) — “the person with the quizzical brow” —and then overhears him insulting her appearance. It’s also where viewers are introduced to Elizabeth as a young woman with sharp wit, who has a retort ready for Darcy when the two later converse.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe joy in the ballroom characterizes the film as a whole. When Wright came on board to direct “Pride and Prejudice,” he felt strongly that the film should evoke the lively nature of youthful romance as well as a “realism, a sense of mess.”\n\nHis intentions are evident in the amount of buoyant, contagious laughter in so many of the scenes featuring the Bennet sisters. There’s the oldest, Jane (Rosamund Pike) followed by our protagonist Elizabeth, then Mary (Talulah Riley), Kitty (Carey Mulligan) and Lydia (Jena Malone). Wright recalls initially thinking he should cast actors who looked similar and realizing that it would be an incredibly difficult endeavor. So instead, “in rehearsals…we developed a laugh so that they all had the same laugh, and that that was what unified them,” he says.\n\nCourtesy of Focus Features\n\nThe enthusiasm of the characters was reflected in the people who worked on it. Wright says despite it being his debut feature, he wasn’t intimidated by the prospect of tackling “Pride and Prejudice” and making the novel’s first film adaptation since the 1940 version starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. “I was very young and reckless, and I didn’t feel the Austen pressure. I felt a pressure to make the best film I could possibly make,” he says.\n\n“It was made in a moment of joy and excitement,” Wright adds. “Austen doesn’t need me. I’m not going to change her legacy with a movie like this, but I was so excited by her talent, by her fierceness, by her emotional, psychological honesty.”\n\nProduction designer Sarah Greenwood also remembers that momentum on set, created from people who were starting off in their careers. “We were all at the same level,” she says.\n\nThe film went on to garner Oscar nominations for Knightley’s performance, Greenwood and Katie Spencer’s art direction and set decoration, Jacqueline Durran’s costume design and Dario Marianelli’s score.\n\nOf course, “Pride and Prejudice” had already been adapted successfully in the modern era, namely through the 1995 BBC series led by Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. “They set us a very high bar. And our approach was a different approach, but did it justice,” Greenwood says.\n\nOne of the ways this adaptation distinguishes itself is through its emphasis on youth. Wright, pointing out that Austen herself was 21 when she wrote the novel, wanted to cast actors who basically matched the characters’ actual ages in the novel. “What I felt most importantly was that Elizabeth Bennet was 18 in the book, and I wanted to make sure that whoever played her was the correct age, that it was a story about people falling in love for the first time, not the second, third or fourth time,” Wright says.\n\nAnother distinction was the fact that this version is placed in 1797, around the time Austen wrote the novel, compared to 1813 when it was published. Greenwood says the film adheres more to the Georgian era rather than the Regency period. “You look at the BBC version, and that’s very Regency, and it’s very tight-laced and high-waisted,” she says.\n\nAnd in line with the change in time period, Wright envisioned the Bennet home, Longbourn, as a place of bustling conversation. “I wanted this loud, busy household in which everyone is constantly talking over each other to try and be heard. And so that’s the atmosphere I was creating, which is quite contrary to any of the period movies that I’d seen before,” Wright says, citing Robert Altman as an influence for the dialogue. “However, I wasn’t doing it to be contrary. I was just trying to convey what I conceived to be the reality and the truth of what it must have been like in that household.”\n\nThe home is also far from pristine. In fact, there’s plenty of dirt and animals trotting around the house — a tangible way of indicating the family’s lack of wealth compared to characters like Darcy and his friend, Charles Bingley.\n\n“What we wanted visually to get the feeling of was the fact that the farm, which was the estate [and] which would have produced all the wealth for the family, was just creeping in on them. It was just encroaching, and so the garden had gone to seed, and the animals were everywhere,” Greenwood says.\n\n“It was just the way of reinterpreting how they could have lived and making it slightly less mannered and slightly more real, which, in fact, is all in the book,” Greenwood continues.\n\nThe Bennet house grounds the story. “It’s like a lodestone in the film,” Greenwood says. “You constantly go back to the Bennet house. All these things happen, and you go back.”\n\nThe location for Longbourn was a house called Groombridge Place. Greenwood remembers the process of re-paneling the dark brown interiors so that the production could paint over everything. The task was “delicate and laborious, but because we were shooting in the house for six weeks, it was really worth doing,” Greenwood says.\n\nThe house ended up with more colors, including blues. Crucially, the paint was made to appear rundown with “lots of aging and patina.” “Nowadays, we have very strong modern chemical paints. We have cleaning products,” Greenwood says. “In those days, they didn’t. They could repaint, but they couldn’t afford it.”\n\nSimilarly, the actual antiques in the house are out of style compared to the fashionability of other wealthy homes since the family couldn’t redecorate. “Therefore, it feels very comfy and very lived-in. We made all the loose covers for the sofas that were all frayed and ratted and torn,” Greenwood says.\n\nMr. Bennet’s office, a cozy nook with bookshelves, serves as the patriarch’s den, Greenwood says. She worked on incorporating the personality of Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) into the space by giving the character a very specific pastime.\n\n“He’s a lovely man, but you don’t get the feeling that he pays much attention to [the estate]. And so it was giving him a hobby that was absolutely useless, there was no purpose to it. What they used to do at the time was… breeding and importing orchids. He’s up a ladder, and he gets an orchid down,” Greenwood says.\n\nIn one shot, viewers can see Kitty tying Lydia’s corset as the camera pans around their bedroom. Fashion plates are stuck onto the walls, in the same way a modern teenager’s room would have postcards or magazine cutouts tacked up. One can imagine the two youngest sisters sitting on their bedroom floor and extracting the fashion plate illustrations out of periodicals.\n\n“Why would a teenage girl in those days be different from a teenage girl today? There was a freedom. And I don’t think our Mrs. Bennet, played by Brenda Blethyn, would have chastised them much, she was not bothered. She was almost a child in her head herself,” Greenwood says.\n\nThe Bennet sisters’ free-spiritedness was crucial for Wright as he worked on bringing the character of Elizabeth to life with Knightley and the other artisans. He based Elizabeth on his own sister, an “anarchist punk in the 1980s who went and got a sledgehammer and helped smash down the Berlin Wall.”\n\nElizabeth tests social conventions and turns down proposals that she knows she cannot accept despite the pressure to get married as soon as possible. Her style in the film reflects her indifference to gender expectations.\n\nCourtesy of Focus Features\n\nCostume designer Durran’s experience working with filmmaker Mike Leigh led to her approaching the clothes “through the lens of a British realism,” according to Wright.\n\n“Everyone, all the other girls get to wear these lovely lilacs and pinks and sage greens, and Keira wears brown. There’s something defiantly unfeminine within the context of the times about her, about her costumes and her hair design, this short hair at the back, which we found a reference for, and we thought was interesting, because it created a kind of rebellion,” Wright says.\n\n“Elizabeth was far more interested in the notion of the mind, rather than in the notion of what she was supposed to be in terms of femininity or gender,” Wright adds.\n\nThe heroine’s independence, her effort to secure a life that she wants within patriarchal structures, is a crucial theme of “Pride and Prejudice.” And the happy ending is hard-earned.\n\nDuring the iconic rain scene in which Darcy shares his feelings for Elizabeth, seemingly out of nowhere, she rejects him, and two begin a thrilling, rapid-fire argument that reveals the misunderstandings they both hold about each other. “We worked almost like music. It was about rhythm. I’m always interested in the rhythm of human interactions,” Wright says.\n\n“I remember we were taking the dialogue quite slowly and thoughtfully, and actually, they’re not thinking, they’re just at each other. And so I remember in rehearsals once I said, ‘Okay, I just want you to run the scene as fast as you can, just the words. Don’t bother acting in it.’ They, really fast, sped through the dialogue. And I said, ‘Okay, that’s how I want the scene to go until that moment of recognition at the end when you look at each other’s mouths, and actually all you want to do is kiss each other.’ And so that was a bit of a discovery for us, but it’s quite technical,” he says.\n\nCourtesy of Focus Features\n\nFollowing Elizabeth’s refusal of Darcy’s proposal and the ensuing confusion she feels about her life, she struggles for clarity. There’s a shot of Elizabeth standing on a cliff, staring into a vast expanse as Marianelli’s score swells.\n\n“What I most loved there was, she’d been in this house, this stifling house with these nightmarish sisters who she loved so much and her mother’s pressure and [having] gone through this quite dark period of the story when she feels like all is lost,” Wright says. “Then there’s this breaking free of that.”\n\nWright took inspiration from David Lean and “big cuts from an extreme close-up of the match, cutting to the landscape of the sun rising in ‘Lawrence of Arabia.'”\n\n“The idea was this shocking cut between the close-up of her eyes, and then suddenly the orchestra. And here’s Dario coming in beautifully. The orchestra bursting out, and we cut to this gigantic wide shot filmed in Derbyshire at exactly the right time of the day,” Wright says. “And, yeah, Keira bounded out onto that cliff’s edge, and everyone freaked out and she was rushed back and they put a wire on her so she couldn’t fall off.”\n\nMarianelli’s romantic score endures on social media. Wright says he remembers being “blown away” by the compositions, which he calls “rhapsodies, almost, these outpourings of emotion.” Marianelli’s music can “express some of the emotions that the characters were required to, because of the social etiquette at the time, repress,” he says.\n\nThe romantic tension ramps up in the film when Elizabeth travels with her aunt and uncle to Pemberley, Darcy’s estate. Chatsworth House, which was supposedly what Austen had in mind for Pemberley when writing the novel, served as the filming location — but not without an initial hurdle.\n\nChatsworth was notorious for not allowing filming, according to Greenwood. “We said to Joe, ‘Well, we can go and look at it and see what we think of it, but, we can’t film here.’ And he said, ‘I don’t want to film here. I just want to have a look.’ So of course, we go there, and it’s absolutely stunning. It’s the most beautiful house. And Joe goes, ‘I want to film here,'” she says.\n\nCourtesy of Focus Features\n\nWright then wrote a letter to the resident, the Duchess of Devonshire, after which she extended an invitation to meet in person. Greenwood says the director was persuasive enough that the production could not just use Chatsworth, but to modify one of its rooms. The sculpture gallery in which Elizabeth admires a bust of Darcy originally had red velvet drapes, and the production was allowed to remove them. “To this day, these drapes have stayed down because the statuary looks so much better against the stone walls than the red velvet. The Victorians put the red velvet up, and we went in and took it down, and it never went back up,” Greenwood says.\n\nMost of the interactions at Darcy’s home were filmed in another location called Wilton House Salisbury.\n\nCollaboration was key to making the film. Wright remembers working with Emma Thompson, who wrote and starred in an adaptation of “Sense and Sensibility,” on the dialogue. “I remember a day when we went up onto Hampstead Heath together, and she started improvising Charlotte’s scene. “I’m 27,” that scene, and I was writing notes on her improvisations. And so she also gave me a sense of confidence in what we were trying to do,” Wright says.\n\nGreenwood similarly discussed artistic choices with Spencer and Durran. “It’s a very considered, joint effort, that everybody communicates so that nothing jars or stands out. The only pure primary color was the red of the soldiers, it’s things like that,” she says.\n\nShe thinks back to how English weather could be a challenge throughout the production and how everyone had to work together to find a solution. The scene in which Mrs. Bennet, cross with Elizabeth refusing Mr. Collins’s marriage offer, chases after her daughter and then goes back to get Mr. Bennet’s help in changing her mind.\n\n“She’s running across the bridge, and her dresses are all flapping, and the geese are going like that. That wasn’t planned. That happened because the light was coming in so low, and Roman [Osin], our DP, couldn’t balance the light for inside, and we didn’t have any time. And it was like, ‘What should we do?’ And Joe said, ‘Right, let’s send that scene outside to the lake because it’s so beautiful,’ and we had, I don’t know, five minutes to get it before the sun went down,” Greenwood says.\n\n“Everybody was gathering all the geese up and corralling them. And, ‘Okay, we’ve got one go at this!’ And it was like, bang, Brenda runs across the bridge with [her dress] flapping like this, and that is one of the most beautiful scenes. And you couldn’t have planned it,” she adds.\n\nLooking back on the film, Wright finds it jarring to mark 20 years, comparing the feeling to a time loop scene in the film, “The Man Who Wasn’t There.”\n\n“There’s a kind of time loop, and I’m sitting doing press for a movie, that is, as if it was made by someone else, and at the same time, as if it only happened yesterday,” Wright says.\n\nHe’s pleased to know that some of the young cast members went on to have fruitful careers. “I was going to say proud, but I’ve no right to be proud. I’m just so excited to see what’s happened to their careers and their personal lives. It’s a lovely thing,” Wright says.\n\nCourtesy of Focus Features\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that the interest in adapting Jane Austen continues, with Netflix’s own “Pride and Prejudice” TV series in the works. But the interest in the 2005 film isn’t fading anytime soon, as audience members venture to theaters to revisit this particular version of the famous love story.\n\n“It still is incredible and fresh and lovely today as it was then, which is really great to see because some films really age,” Greenwood says. “But yeah, this one doesn’t seem to.”"

With The Mandalorian & Grogu set to take over cinemas worldwide in May 2026 and a New Republic-era event movie in active development, it sure looks like the characters' future is tied to the big screen.\n\nAt Star Wars Celebration Japan, longtime collaborators Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau introduced Sigourney Weaver as a veteran Rebel pilot who now holds a high rank as a member of the New Republic's military forces. In fact, the leaked footage (you'll have to look around) teases she's the person Din Djarin is responding to, at least during the bulk of the movie, while he works for the new galactic government hunting down the remaining Imperial warlords that refuse to surrender.\n\nAnother actor now confirmed to be part of the ensemble is Jeremy Allen White (The Bear) as Rotta the Hutt, son of the now deceased Jabba. If you've watched The Clone Wars you might remember a certain little Stinky the Huttlet…. well, the big twist is that Rotta is buff now and fighting in gladiatorial arenas.\n\nWriter-director Jon Favreau and the actress Sigourney Weaver stopped by the Star Wars Celebration's live stage to discuss her involvement in the next theatrical Star Wars installment, which aims to reignite the franchise's big-screen presence before we move on to new stories such as the just-announced Star Wars: Starfighter. You can watch the extensive conversation below:\n\nJon Favreau and Sigourney Weaver | Star Wars Celebration LIVE! - YouTube Watch On\n\nFor those who can't find recordings of the footage online or just want to learn some tidbits without actually watching it, we've got you covered: The teaser begins with Din Djarin, the titular Mandalorian, assaulting a massive AT-AT walker from the inside in one continuous shot that's beautifully choregraphed. He later blows up the big vehicle with explosives and flies away with his trusty jetpack and Grogu.\n\nAt this point, Weaver's character (not named yet) is introduced and we get fast shots of a new Razor Crest ship for the duo, Din walking alongside Zeb Orrelios, and Grogu using the Force and even swimming. Another huge action sequence, likely tied to the starting one, takes place on a snowy planet and has the two characters running away from a convoy of AT-ATs on a bipedal walker.\n\nThe Mandalorian & Grogu is coming to cinemas on May 22, 2026."

Six women, led by superstar Katy Perry, were flying into space!\n\nBy contrast, Ars Technica has been largely silent. Why? Because yet another suborbital flight on New Shepard matters little in the long arc of spaceflight history. Beyond that, I did not want to be too negative about someone else's happiness, especially since it was privately funded. Live and let live, and all of that.\n\nHowever, if I'm being frank, this flight and its breathless promotion made me uncomfortable. Let me explain. Perhaps the most important change in spaceflight over the last two decades has been the rise of commercial spaceflight, which is bringing down the cost of access to space and marks an essential step to humanity becoming a spacefaring species. This rising tide has been spurred in large part by billionaires, particularly Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and, to a lesser extent, Richard Branson.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, Branson and Bezos took flights on their own rockets. This fueled the \"boys and their toys\" and \"billionaire joyrides\" public perception of commercial spaceflight. My issue with the NS-31 flight is that it perpetuates this perception. True, an all-women flight is definitely not boys and their toys. But consider what NS-31 really was. Bezos wanted to send his fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, to space. And that's fine. One can imagine that she wanted some attention on her flight, so they invited Perry. And presto, a media sensation and lots of glam. But the resulting spectacle trivializes the important work of commercial space.\n\nAnyway, I decided that Ars Technica should sit this one out.

            "content": "Ben Affleck is weighing in on the flight of film and television productions from Hollywood.\n\nThe actor and filmmaker took on California’s production crisis in an interview with the Associated Press at The Accountant 2’s red carpet premiere at L.A.’s TCL Chinese Theatre on Wednesday. “I think part of the problem with California is they came to take this industry for granted a little bit,” Affleck said, noting that other jurisdictions offer more favorable exchange rates and tax rebates.\n\nAffleck pointed out that California Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed a major increase to the state’s cap on its tax incentives program for the film and television industry. But, he said, it’s not in enough to stem the tide of film and TV sets fleeing California and the U.S. in general for savings. “The percentage you get back in terms of actual budget doesn’t compete with places like England, which is why you see a lot of these big, huge movies shoot in the U.K.”\n\nAffleck also mentioned that attractive incentives from states like Georgia, New Mexico, Louisiana, Texas, Massachusetts and New Jersey have drawn projects out of state as studios and streamers chased cost savings in the post-Peak TV landscape. Georgia and New Mexico, for instance, have no annual cap on their incentives programs.\n\nThe filmmaker further raised the specter of one of the state’s hallmark attractions for productions — its crew talent — leaving the state altogether. “It’s really the technicians and the crew that make or break your movie,” he said. “You need the best people, you need good people. I, as a director, know that to be true. And so if people move away, you know, that really hurts the industry.”\n\nDespite the barriers that he laid out, at least a couple of Affleck’s recent projects have notably invested in local production. The Gavin O’Connor-directed Accountant 2 shot at least partially in Los Angeles and Santa Clarita. Affleck is also currently filming his upcoming Netflix project Animals, in which he is directing and starring, in the city.\n\nOn-location shoot days and levels of soundstage occupancy in Los Angeles have nosedived in recent years, with ramifications for L.A. businesses and crew communities. The downturn has sparked a movement to return production to its cultural home in the U.S. called “Stay in L.A.” and a legislative effort in Sacramento to expand California’s current tax incentives program."

            "description": "On Variety's Awards Circuit Podcast, Bruce Springsteen and 'Road Diary' director Thom Zimny explain hour the Boss finally allowed filming of his tour.",
            "content": "The fact that “Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band” even exists goes against everything the Boss used to believe. Up until a few years ago, he admits he was “very superstitious” about filming the band.\n\n“I didn’t believe that the magician should look too closely at his magic trick, that it might alter it in some way,” Springsteen tells Variety’s Awards Circuit Podcast, in the Emmy season kickoff episode. “And we were doing fine… It’s really amazing that we have the films that we have from when we were a younger man, because I was pretty much against filming.”\n\nDirected by longtime collaborator Thom Zimny, “Road Diary” — currently streaming on Hulu and Disney+ — contains loads of that archival film, including 1975 footage from London’s Hammersmith Apollo. “What got captured got captured almost by accident,” he says. “At the Hammersmith Apollo, the BBC just filmed it. I don’t know if I was even aware of them filming it that night, and I didn’t look at it for 30 years.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBut in recent years, Springsteen changed his tune. “We’re at a point now where we should be filming at least everything we do,” he says. “Once a tour or once an album, I enjoy filming, including films with our records. Now it’s just a part of what we do.” With Zimny, that has included “Letter to You,” “Western Stars” and “Springsteen on Broadway.”\n\n“Road Diary” chronicles Springsteen’s 2023-2025 world tour, which was seen (especially early on) as even more introspective than usual. Springsteen came into the tour with a very specific idea of theme and flow, including a setlist that was pretty rigid at first.\n\n“I had a very clear idea of what I wanted to sing and write about, which was the band and our philosophy — and what it feels like to age alongside of your friends, and what it feels like at this age to experience your mortality,” he says. “You see your friends passing rather often these days. Those were issues that were on my mind.”\n\nThat’s why the Commodores’ “Nightshift” became an unlikely cover for Springsteen, but it’s now a staple and showstopper in his concerts. “ I always loved that song,” he says. “I remember sitting in a bar in Red Bank and just having a drink, and it came on the playlist. And I got choked up. I was a few tequilas in, and that helped, I suppose, but I heard that song and I said, ‘God, I love that song.’ It was a little bit of a lost masterpiece. It wasn’t a song that people mentioned much. So when I was going to do my soul covers album, I said, ‘I want to do “Nightshift!” It ended up being a nice duet between Curtis [King] and I, and it’s just the bottom line is the emotion is simply in the song. It’s a beautiful song about people passing and working on the night shift.”\n\nThe film pays tribute to late original E Street Band members Clarence Clemons (who died in 2011) and Danny Federici (who died in 2008), including old interviews.\n\n“Both of them come from a film that I had worked on about ‘Darkness on the Edge of Town,’” Zimny says. “And for years, I’ve saved those clips and felt like ‘Road Diary,’ I had this mission to not only bring the sonic qualities of those players and guys in E Street in the forefront, but literally to see their expressions again, their smiles, hear the musicality of their voices. I thought a lot about my experience as a fan and the importance of that. I wanted to explore the E Street history, but also the presence of being in the pit and taking in that show.”\n\nOf course, not everything’s in the film. Springsteen was forced to postpone several dates at the end of 2023 after being diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease, but that hiatus isn’t addressed here.\n\n“I didn’t think my peptic ulcer was film-worthy, so we left it out,” Springsteen says. “I actually enjoyed the time off, but you hate disappointing your fans. And it actually took a while for the whole thing to calm down and give back to my to myself. So it was an unusual experience, because I’m usually pretty ironclad. But no, we never considered it making it part of this story.”\n\nUp next in Springsteenland, Jeremy Allen White will be seen in the biopic “Deliver Me From Nowhere,” playing the Boss in a feature about the making of his 1982 album “Nebraska.” The film is adapted by Warren Zanes’ book of the same name and comes from director/writer Scott Cooper.\n\n“They pitched the idea, and I said, ‘it sounds like fun,’” Springsteen says. “It’s an interesting concept, because it’s only a couple of years out of my life. It’s ’81, ’82, and centered around the creation of that particular record while I was simultaneously recording ‘Born in the USA’ and also going through some personal difficulties that I’ve been living with my whole life. But it’s fantastic.”\n\nSpringsteen says he was impressed by what he saw of Jeremy Allen White, who’s playing the musician during that era. “I was on tour during a lot of it, so they filmed a good amount of it without me there,” Springsteen says. “But I was on set sometimes. It was interesting to see it played out, to see your grandmother’s house again, and to go inside and get a general feeling of what it was like when you were very young. So I enjoyed all those parts of it.”\n\nThe star also recently made waves on social media when he attended a Los Angeles Lakers game – and caught a flying basketball. “It was either catch it or bounce it off my head,” he says. “So I decided I’d catch it.”\n\nAs for what’s next, Springsteen and the band hit the road once again in May for dates in Europe, followed by Canada. Would he consider another live box set chronicling his last few decades touring? “What we’re doing now is basically, we release every show,” he notes. “You can have any live show that you want, shortly after we do it. It’d be possible to do a live album again, if we felt like it. But I think they’re less in demand these days, because people have the ability to purchase any of the show they’ve been at, or any of a hundred others.”\n\nAsked about the state of the country — and music’s role in responding to what is happening to our democracy — Springsteen says it’s something he’s thinking about. “One of the artists’ jobs to make sense of existence and to make sense of the current times that you live in, and to contextualize those times,” he says. “Every artist does it in a different way. So I’ve got that on my mind, and I’m sure it’ll be reflected in our next leg of the tour.”"

            "description": "Seth Rogen’s savvy Hollywood satire has half the town wondering who inspired the show’s characters. We rounded up the prime suspects.",
            "content": "The core audience for screen depictions of Hollywood has always been Hollywood itself. Apple TV+‘s anxiety-inducing Tinseltown sendup The Studio — about a midlevel exec, played by co-creator Seth Rogen, who is promoted to studio chief and finds himself irreconcilably torn between making art and the bottom line — is the ultimate series à clef. Rest assured that industry types are parsing every frame, wondering who’s based on whom, and hoping they’re not the ones being lampooned. And if not, why the hell not?\n\nWarner Bailey, creator of the popular insider Instagram account Assistants vs. Agents, attended the show’s star-studded L.A. premiere in March and recalls the nervous excitement in the room. “You’d look around and there was like a flash of pain on people’s faces. They were laughing but also gasping when the absurdity would unfold. It became very clear that people saw themselves on the screen.”\n\nMost of the characters are surely composites. But drawing from clues dropped by the show’s creators — as well as pure speculation — THR set out to map the Hollywood genomes of The Studio‘s principal players.\n\nMATT REMICK (SETH ROGEN)\n\nIllustration by Brian Taylor\n\nIt’s safe to assume that the head of Continental Films is an amalgam of every beleaguered exec Rogen has encountered since his breakout at 17 on Freaks and Geeks, when mentor Judd Apatow reportedly warned him that the studio suits were “operating out of a place of sheer panic.” Given how much Rogen and co-writer Evan Goldberg seem to have drawn from their Sony experience in the mid-2010s, it’s tempting to seek corollaries for Matt Remick in the similarly named Matt Tolmach and Doug Belgrad, who worked under Amy Pascal as co-presidents of production. Current Sony CEO Tom Rothman, for what it’s worth, introduced to himself at CinemaCon as “Seth Rogen.” The one person Rogen has cited is 20th Century’s Steve Asbell, who once joked to him, “I got into this because I love movies, and now it’s my job to ruin them.”\n\nSAL SAPERSTEIN (IKE BARINHOLTZ)\n\nIllustration by Brian Taylor\n\n“Everyone has a Sal in their office, someone high up who’s always taking a call in the hallway just loud enough for the whole floor to hear,” observes Bailey, of the Hollywood insider Instagram account Assistants vs. Agents. In other words, he has no idea who the real Sal Saperstein is, either. Barinholtz certainly isn’t giving away many clues. All he’s revealed is that the character is cobbled together from a variety of studio execs he’s dealt with over the years. “When they’re watching the show,” he recently shared, “they might be like, ‘I think I said that one time.’ ”\n\nMAYA MASON (KATHRYN HAHN)\n\nIllustration by Brian Taylor\n\nHahn has been slippery about the inspirations for her overly caffeinated, expletive-spewing head of marketing, saying during a recent interview that Maya was based on “a tapestry of women.” That tapestry may well include strands of Blair Rich, marketing chief at Legendary, and Sue Kroll, Amazon MGM’s marketing boss, both of whom have Maya-like résumés (and temperaments). But there might be threads of Sue Mengers as well. Rogen could have encountered the late, famously outrageous agent back when he made 2012’s The Guilt Trip with Mengers’ client Barbra Streisand.\n\nQUINN HACKETT (CHASE SUI WONDERS)\n\nIllustration by Brian Taylor\n\nThough Wonders has not named a specific inspiration for Quinn, the assistant turned junior executive, she has provided a key observation: “[Quinn] is so a nepo baby,” Wonders tells The Hollywood Reporter. “Her apartment is insane. I walked into set and I was like, ‘Wow, Seth and Evan, her nepotism is really showing.’ ” One can only guess at commonalities with other executives with familiar last names, including Warner Bros.’ Courtenay Valenti, Marvel’s Brian Chapek and Amy Pascal protégé (and Anthony Minghella daughter) Hannah Minghella of Netflix.\n\nGRIFFIN MILL (BRYAN CRANSTON)\n\nIllustration by Brian Taylor\n\nRogen has said the inspiration for the flinty but flamboyant billionaire is David Zaslav — it’s not hard to imagine the mogul who nearly shuttered TCM greenlighting a live-action Kool-Aid tentpole. But initially, Rogen had a more buttoned-up personality in mind (“More like a Michael Lynton-type … a boring, scary-suit kind of guy”), so some of that DNA might linger. Sartorially, the ascot-wearing dandy owes a debt to the late Bob Evans, whose Beverly Hills mansion, incidentally, is now owned by Warners chief Zas. Or take Griffin Mill’s name at face value: This is who Tim Robbins’ character in The Player has become 33 years later.\n\nPATTY LEIGH (CATHERINE O’HARA)\n\nIllustration by Brian Taylor\n\nNo mystery here — just look at the hair. Plus, Rogen has been transparent about whom this character is based on. “Amy is someone who was a huge mentor,” he’s said of Pascal, who ran Sony when he had his overall deal with the studio. Really, about the only one who isn’t entirely sure who Patty is supposed to be is the actress who plays her. “I did not go into researching too much about her,” O’Hara has said. “I didn’t want to be accused of playing anyone in particular.” (We’re throwing in a pinch of Amazon’s recently booted chief Jen Salke because she’s made the character suddenly seem zeitgeisty.)\n\nThis story appeared in the April 16 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

The Fox News employee contacted security personnel over the incident, and Fischer was “escorted… off the floor,” the comedian told the Daily Mail.\n\nIn a statement to Variety, Fischer said: “This was a mutual and very friendly interaction. When asked if she would like to get coffee she said yes. At that point phone numbers were consensually exchanged. Absolutely nothing aggressive or forceful happened from me or her.”\n\nPrior to his final appearance on “Gutfeld!” in January, Fischer had been on the show 15 times.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2025 — President Trump’s inauguration day — Fox News’ Fox Nation streaming service premiered “No Pardon Needed With Tyler Fischer,” which was recorded at Joe Rogan’s comedy club in Austin, Texas. The 45-minute special is “a satirical look at the current state of politics and culture,” and featured Fischer’s impersonations of Trump, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Elon Musk and others in Trump’s cabinet, according to Fox.\n\nIn announcing Fischer’s special on Fox Nation, Fox News described Fischer as “a rising star in stand-up comedy and content creation” fronting election- and pandemic-focused comedy specials “showcasing his celebrity impressions and knack for blending cultural commentary that resonates across generations and political leanings.” According to the network’s announcement, Fischer lives between Austin and New York City. He recently embarked on his second nationwide stand-up comedy tour.\n\nFischer, in his post on X, said that “After being canceled, I have reached out to people at the TV show for months and they have completely ghosted me.”"

            "description": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs desire to push back his criminal trial fell short today as a federal judge is determined to get things going by early May.",
            "content": "Barring unforeseen circumstances, Sean “Diddy‘ Combs’ criminal trial for sex trafficking and more will start next month. Also, footage from a Warner Bros Discovery Fall Of Diddy docuseries about the much accused “I’ll Be Missing You” performer will be allowed as evidence, despite the efforts of the David Zaslav-run media giant.\n\nWith the former mini-mogul in attendance, a federal judge this morning rejected a motion by Combs’ defense to push back the trial by 60 days. Almost right from the top of the hearing, Judge Arun Subramanian denied the sealed move by the Marc Agnifilo- and Teny Geragos-led legal team based on the defense’s assertions that the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York was slow in handing over evidence and even lacked possession of certain evidence from Victim-4 in the case.\n\nOnce again calling the defense’s claims nothing new in a case that has been bogged down in procedural battles the past few months since Combs’ September arrest in a Big Apple hotel, Judge Subramanian chided the defense for looking to shift the May 5 trial start by two months, not two weeks. Noting the bulk of the latest indictment was much the same as past filings, the judge told the defense it was “unclear why there isn’t sufficient time to prepare.”\n\nWith jury selection set to begin the first week of May, the actual opening statements in the incarcerated and heavily lawyered up Combs’ trial are penciled in for May 12. If found guilty on the charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and more, the 55-year-old Bad Boy Records founder will likely be behind bars for the rest of his life.\n\nMoving briskly through pre-trial motions Friday, Judge Subramanian also denied an attempt by Warner Bros Discovery to stop outtakes from its January debuting Fall of Diddy docuseries.\n\nSpecifically, the footage the defense wants to see involves a former employee of Combs and an ex-girlfriend. WBD flew the flag of reporter’s privilege to keep the outtakes out of the case. However, today, Judge Subramanian rejected that notion because both of the individuals in the footage are pretty certain to be giving testimony in the trial and therefore the outtakes are relevant and admissible.\n\nRELATED: Sean “Diddy” Combs Decries Latest Indictment From Feds As Nothing New; Invading “Private Sex Life”\n\nCombs has failed three times since his arrest last fall to be released on a $50 million bail package, and is currently housed in one of the nicer units of Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center as inmate 37452-054. More charges have been added by the politically besieged SDNY since the New Year, including a superseding indictment that Combs entered yet another not guilty plea to in a hastily convened April 14 hearing.\n\nCassie Ventura and Sean “Diddy” Combs in 2018 John Shearer/Getty Images\n\nBuilding off the quickly settled ($30 million) assault and abuse suit and more from Victim-1, a.k.a former Combs girlfriend Cassie Ventura (who has said she will testify in open court in the trial), prosecutors allege that Combs and his aides coerced women and men into marathon sordid sexual encounters called “freak-offs.” The sessions included male and female prostitutes, drug use, threats of violence and imprisonment in the hotel rooms where the acts were staged and videotaped.\n\nIn a filing late April 17 the government summed up its case by saying: “Over the course of more than a decade, the defendant subjected multiple victims to sexual, physical, emotional, and verbal abuse. With respect to Victim-1, Victim-2, and Victim-3, the defendant used those forms of abuse, along with threats, fraud, and coercion, to cause them to engage in commercial sex acts.”\n\nRELATED: Feds Hit Diddy With Forced Labor Claims In Sex Trafficking Case; Reject Move By Rapper To Suppress Digital Evidence\n\nIn stark terms, the feds added: “Freak Offs were multi-day sex performances that the defendant arranged, directed, masturbated during, and often electronically recorded. The defendant exercised control over the victims through, among other things, physical violence, promises of career and financial\n\nopportunities, granting and threatening to withhold financial support, and by other coercive means,\n\nincluding tracking their whereabouts, dictating the victims’ appearance, monitoring their medical\n\nrecords, controlling their housing, and supplying them with controlled substances. The\n\nGovernment expects the evidence to show the following with respect to Victim-1, Victim-2, and\n\nVictim-3, as well as other victims.”\n\nProclaiming that he has done no wrong and all the relationships were consensual, the defense has exclaimed the feds are using “racist” laws against Combs and seeking to “police non-conforming sexual activity.” In that vein, on February 24, the defense took a judicial poke at “unconstitutionally broad” search warrants that had been used on Combs as part of spring 2024 raids of his Los Angeles and Miami homes, devices, digital storage and more.\n\nIn today’s over two-hour hearing, Judge Subramanian ruled that Ventura — Victim 1 in the indictment — must turn over all versions of an unpublished draft memoir she wrote to the Combs’ lawyers by next Friday, but not any related correspondence or bank statements sought by the defense. Subramanian will also allow three prosecution witnesses — Victims 2, 3 and 4 in the indictment — to testify using pseudonyms, despite defense arguments that Victims 3 and 4 have spoken publicly in the past about their ties to Combs and are likely to be easily identifiable when they’re on the stand. The judge said he is open to changing his ruling if Combs’ lawyers can persuade him that anonymity harms the defense team’s ability to put on their case or challenge the witnesses’ credibility.\n\n\n\nThe judge also said he would limit the testimony of a psychological expert hired by prosecutors to testify in general terms about the dynamics of abusive relationships, and said the expert will not be allowed to utter the phrase “coercive control” while on the stand.\n\nFollowing that, Judge Subramanian denied a defense motion to throw out some of the counts in the indictment, but in a win for Combs’ lawyers barred testimony from two prosecution witnesses who were poised to discuss alleged abuse by Combs that occurred two decades ago. “That evidence is excluded,” Subramanian said, agreeing with the defense that the testimony was “potentially explosive” and “uncorroborated.”\n\nAs well as the criminal case, Combs is charged in dozens and dozens of civil actions (mainly from Houston-based attorney Tony Buzbee) claiming assault and abuse similar to the sex trafficking claims. He has entered not guilty pleas to all of them, with several since dismissed or having died on the legal vine.\n\nAlong with the various pre-trial motions being addressed, this week has also seen more muscle added to Combs’ defense team.\n\nComing off an ultimately successful stint representing rapper Young Thug in his gang and racketeering trial, Atlanta attorney Brian Steel has joined the defense. Earlier this year, Anthony Ricco left the defense, citing in a declaration before the court: “Although I have provided Sean Combs with the high level of legal representation expected by the court, under no circumstances can I continue to effectively serve as counsel for Sean Combs, consistent with the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice.”\n\nMORE"

            "content": "John Cena's the bad guy in his final WrestleMania. Here's why that's a big deal\n\ntoggle caption Georgiana Dallas/WWE via Getty Images\n\nFor most of John Cena's WWE career, you couldn't see him being a bad guy on TV.\n\nCena has won a record 16 WWE world championships since debuting in 2002. He's taken on the biggest names in wrestling, including The Rock, The Undertaker, Randy Orton and CM Punk. His heroic performances earned him the often-meant-in-jest nickname \"SuperCena.\"\n\nAgainst all seeming odds, during critical matches, Cena would spring back up, hit his finishing move and pin his opponents.\n\nAnd he's done most of that as a \"babyface,\" or the good guy in the ring. Cena's gimmick endeared him to wrestling's youngest fans throughout the years so much so that he became the Make-A-Wish Foundation's most requested celebrity wish granter. In 2022, he set the Guinness World Record for most wishes granted.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut this weekend, Cena heads into what is slated to be his final WrestleMania – the biggest showcase in wrestling – as a heel. He's taking on defending WWE champion Cody Rhodes and, if he wins, Cena would break the record for most WWE world championships.\n\nCena announced last year that he would retire from in-ring competition at the end of 2025. He shocked fans in March by attacking Rhodes, after securing a title match, and made his heel turn official.\n\nYouTube\n\nSince then, Cena has lambasted WWE crowds for their love-hate relationship with him and promised to \"ruin wrestling\" for everyone.\n\n\"I will win that championship and retire with it. I am taking it home with me!\" Cena proclaimed to a crowd at the March 24 episode of WWE Raw. \"I will be the last real champion in WWE.\"\n\nSo is his time really up? And why is Cena's heel turn such a big deal to wrestling fans?\n\nMorning Edition explored these questions and Cena's evolution with David Shoemaker, a writer for culture website The Ringer and host of its wrestling podcast, The Masked Man.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nA Martínez: The wrestling world has a word for this, the heel turn. So how big of a deal was it when John Cena did it?\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDavid Shoemaker: It was a really big deal, one, because John Cena, like you said, hadn't been a heel for the 20 years of his fame. He's just been known as the most consistent babyface, as they say in the business. It was also a big deal from a fan's perspective because we've been begging for him to turn heel for most of those 20 years. We're used to seeing our wrestlers go back and forth on the spectrum. And John Cena has been a stalwart, refusing to embrace the dark side for this whole time.\n\nMartínez: Now, on WWE Raw last month, Cena sounded like he kind of enjoys playing the bad guy. Why would you want to go out like this? I mean, is this something that fans actually like? I mean, you said you've been clamoring for, but does everyone else feel that way?\n\nShoemaker: I talk to wrestlers all the time. Most of them prefer playing heel. It's more fun. You get to just ham it up out there for the fans also. They all know that boos are just as good as cheers in their line of work. Will he go out as a heel? This is his final year. My guess is that his last month will probably be as a fan favorite because you can always go home again. But for right now, he's getting to do the thing that he's always wanted to do, too. I mean, it's not just the fans. He's talked openly about wanting this opportunity, wanting to play the bad guy. And I think you can tell from his monologues in the ring he's really enjoying it.\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Timms/WWE via Getty Images\n\nMartínez: Now, last month, there was another star of the big screen in the ring, coaxing Cena to go over to the dark side. And that was The Rock. So, I mean, what does it mean that these two mega movie stars are playing wrestling villains? Is he following The Rock's footsteps here?\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShoemaker: He is in a lot of ways. The Rock came back last year and teased a WrestleMania main event match, and he was a hero and he thought everybody would get behind him. But after he took the spot from Cody Rhodes, the fans turned and said, \"No, we don't want that. We want Cody. He's the guy that we've been following all this time.\" And the Rock played it on the fly and turned heel. And it turned out to be the best move he could make. I think there was a lot of conventional wisdom that a Hollywood star, the level of The Rock, couldn't play heel because it would jeopardize his mainstream appeal. It would make those rope line interviews awkward or whatever. But it turned out to be the best business decision he could have made. He's more famous now and then he possibly could have been. Everybody just took it in stride. And I think you're seeing the same thing with John Cena.\n\nMartínez: Do you think he's really going to retire?\n\nShoemaker: Well, pro wrestlers are really bad at retiring famously, just like boxers, you know. I mean, you usually retire at the end of a match when everybody's watching you because you want that moment in the sun, right? And then two months later, you're sitting at home and you don't have anything to do and you change your mind. But of all the wrestlers that have ever said they're going to retire, John Cena is one that I believe. He's a man, it seems to be, of real conviction outside of the ring and would not be doing this without having really thought it through.\n\nTreye Green edited this digital story.

            "content": "Joe Seiders, the drummer for indie rock band the New Pornographers, has been arrested on possession of child pornography charges, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department confirmed in a press release Thursday.\n\nSoon after the arrest, the band confirmed that Seiders, 44, is no longer a member of the group. “Everyone in the band is absolutely devastated by the news of the charges against Joe Seiders — and we have immediately severed all ties with him,” the band said in a statement shared on social media. “Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by his actions.”\n\nThe New Pornographers were formed in the ’90s, and Seiders joined in 2014, playing drums and singing backup vocals on the band’s most recent three albums Whiteout Conditions, In the Morse Code of Brake Lights and Continue as a Ghost.\n\nAccording to the Sheriff’s Department, authorities were first dispatched to a Palm Desert business in the late afternoon on April 7, speaking with an 11-year-old boy who said an unidentified male had recorded him on his cellphone while the boy was using the restroom. Two days later, authorities got a second report at the same location at just past 5 p.m., after an employee said that a man was “entering and exiting the restroom with juvenile males at the business.” Authorities identified the man as Seiders and took him into custody.\n\nAuthorities obtained search warrants for Seiders’ residence, cellphone and vehicle and found evidence implicating him in the two reported incidents, as well as other crimes, the release said. Authorities said Seiders was booked into Indio’s John Benoit Detention Center for possession of child pornography, annoying/molesting a child, invasion of privacy and attempted invasion of privacy."

            "content": "Ryan Googler’s critically acclaimed Sinners starring Michael B. Jordan bit off an impressive $4.7 million in Thursday previews as Easter weekend gets underway at the box office, where the period vampire pic will battle with A Minecraft Movie for top spoils. Speaking of the latter, Minecraft jumped the $300 million mark on Thursday domestically.\n\nAll eyes on are how Coogler’s Sinners performs, since the bold original pic was made entirely by Warner Bros. movie chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy from start to finish.\n\nSinners has plenty of advantages as it arrives on the big screen. Reuniting Coogler with his go-to leading man Jordan, the R-rated movie boasts the best Rotten Tomatoes critics’ score of Coogler’s career with 97 percent.\n\nWarners, trying to manage expectations, is targeting an opening in the $35 million to $40 million range for Sinners. There’s reason to be circumspect, considering the film is an R-rated, period supernatural vampire pic. Tracking services are more bullish in suggesting $40 million to $45 million, while rival studios think Sinner‘s launch could end up north of $50 million.\n\nProduced and co-financed by Legendary alongside Vertigo, Minecraft should easily earn $40 million to $45 million in its third outing as it jumps the $600 million mark globally, including $300 million domestically. The film is on its way to becoming one of the top video game adaptations of all time, and is already the top-grossing pic of 2025 in a feather-in-the-cap for De Luca and Abdy.\n\nSinners is a defining moment for the executive duo and their commitment to working with high-profile auteurs, and giving filmmakers a relatively wide berth in terms of budget. Sinners cost $90 million to make before marketing, a relatively hefty price tag for a genre movie (that’s ahead of the $50 budget for Coogler and Jordan’s Creed).\n\nCoogler burst onto the scene with the indie hit Fruitvale Station before going on to direct Creed and the Black Panther franchise.\n\nA period pic, the 1932-set Sinners stars Jordan in dual roles as identical twin entrepreneurs known as Smoke and Stack. Having survived the World War I trenches and Chicago gangland, the brothers return after seven years to their segregated Mississippi Delta hometown, Clarksdale. They are flush with cash and have a truckload of liquor and a plan to open a juke joint. However, they encounter unexpected horrors.\n\n“Sinners is the gifted writer-director’s first entirely original feature, not based on real-life events or existing IP, and he packs it with enough thematic layers and genre fluidity to fuel at least three movies,” writes David Rooney in The Hollywood Reporter‘s review."

            "content": "Aimee Lou Wood absolutely crushed it on The White Lotus’ third season, as her adoring Chelsea stole the show even amidst crazy storylines like the incestuous Ratliff brothers and the too-real female friendship. So it must be frustrating for Wood that her teeth keep coming up in conversation. The situation came to a head last weekend when the actress took issue with Saturday Night Live’s parody of her, and cast member Bowen Yang said Wood’s reaction was “completely valid.”\n\nChelsea’s story on The White Lotus (which can be streamed with a Max subscription) ended tragically, as both she and boyfriend Rick (Walton Goggins) were killed in a shootout at the titular resort. But much of the talk about her performance has been overshadowed by comments about her teeth. In “The White Potus” sketch that aired April 12 on the 2025 TV schedule, Sarah Sherman wore fake teeth in an apparent portrayal of Chelsea, which Aimee Lou Wood called “mean and unfunny.”\n\nBowen Yang understood the reaction, telling Extra:\n\nHowever she reacted to that sketch is completely valid. You kind of forget the sort of human, emotional cost that it sort of extols on someone.\n\nIn trying to produce relevant sketches for SNL Season 50 host Jon Hamm, it seems the writers at Saturday Night Live forgot to consider that it was a real person’s physical appearance they were making a joke about, not just a fictional character on TV.\n\nAimee Lou Wood had made it clear she was over talking about her teeth, and Bowen Yang said the situation served as a reminder for the SNL writers to consider the impact of their jokes. In Yang’s words:\n\nYou need those reminders every now and then that parody can go too far sometimes, and that we as comedians can take account for that instead of banging our foot and saying that, like, we should be allowed to say whatever we want because that’s just the culture.\n\nIn the days that followed, Aimee Lou Wood was seen sobbing in South London, with many jumping to the conclusion that she was upset about her SNL portrayal. However, she clarified that her woes were “completely unrelated” to the NBC sketch show drama. You can see “The White Potus\" sketch below:\n\nThe White Potus - SNL - YouTube Watch On\n\nThe actress also suggested on social media that she’d received “apologies from SNL,” but it turns out the apology was not made in an official capacity on behalf of Saturday Night Live, but rather was a personal gesture from someone she knows on the show. That might have been Sarah Sherman herself, who did send Aimee Lou Wood flowers in the aftermath of the sketch, as the actress showed them off on social media.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nPeacock TV: from $7.99 a month/$79.99 a year\n\nTune into Saturday Night Live and the other latest hits from NBC and Bravo by subscribing to Peacock TV.

She really was like, 'What was that conversation about?' I was like, 'I don't know anything!' She is like a laser. So she zeroed right in on it, and she's like, 'Is it you? Is it you?' I could barely keep any secrets.\"\n\nThe actor says that he never even hinted at Julian's guilt to his wife, Yellowjackets star Melanie Lynskey. \"It was just the writers and me, as far as I could tell,\" says Ritter, who spoke to EW ahead of Thursday's finale. \"Melanie doesn't like any spoilers, so I couldn't even tell her at home. I still haven't told Melanie. She will not know until the finale airs because she really dislikes a spoiler. So yeah, I'll finally be able to stop keeping secrets in my own home.\"\n\nRitter also recalls the reaction in the room when the cast read through the script for the final episode of the season. \"Some people have purposefully not read the finale to be able to hear it live,\" he explains. \"It was really fun to get to the finale and hear gasps in the room, and 'I can't believe it was you!'\"\n\nHe continues, \"I remember people having a big response to it, and we all were talking about what's going to happen next. How is season 2 going to start with all of the incredible cliffhangers? Alfie's father coming home, Claudia's pregnancy, and all of that stuff. There's so much going on — it's very exciting.\"\n\nJason Ritter and Skye P. Marshall on 'Matlock'. CBS\n\nIn Ritter's standout scene in the finale, Julian confesses his guilt to Olympia, revealing that he conspired with his father to hide evidence that could have taken opioids off the market. \"We've seen Julian come clean about his affair, we've seen him not at his best — fighting, sniping, being a little jerk sometimes,\" Ritter reflects. \"But this is the first time that we've seen Julian completely vulnerable like this.\"\n\nRitter says, \"His armor has just cracked, and someone's ready to slice his Achilles heel at any moment. The most challenging thing was trying to think: since this person has created this fortress around his secret, what does it look like when the walls crumble down?\"\n\nSeason 1 of Matlock is now streaming on Paramount+.\n\n"

            "content": "Anne Hathaway’s seemingly ageless appearance became a hot topic of discussion after the actress sat front row at Ralph Lauren’s fall 2025 fashion show.\n\nThe “Devil Wears Prada” star, 42, looked fresh-faced as she took in the stunning collection alongside a slew of other celebs, such as Michelle Williams, Naomi Watts and Kacey Musgraves, in New York City on Thursday.\n\nPhotos and videos of Hathaway’s taut look quickly went viral on social media, with some fans questioning how she has maintained such a smooth, wrinkle-free look.\n\n10 Anne Hathaway’s ageless look went viral on Thursday.

Getty Images\n\n“These plastic surgeons are getting real good,” one user wrote on X, to which another agreed, “Money well spent i can’t even tell.”\n\n“She’s like a vampire. She doesn’t look like she’s aging,” a third commented.\n\n“Whatever procedure/treatment Anne Hathaway had done to her face has her looking STUNNING. She’s always been gorgeous but honey??” a fourth chimed in.\n\n10 She stunned in a full tan look with a sleek ponytail.

GC Images\n\n10 They noted that it was “money well spent” and that she seems to be aging backwards. GC Images\n\nOthers, meanwhile, noted that Hathaway’s super sleek ponytail may have doubled as a temporary facelift.\n\n“If she’s had work done, it’s very very good. But let’s not discount the power of the slick back ponytail face lift,” a netizen pointed out.\n\n“it’s the makeup and hairstyle giving the tight illusion,” another agreed on Reddit.\n\nHathaway has maintained a youthful glow ever since she first stepped onto the scene at just 17 years old.\n\n10 Others credited her taut ponytail for the make-shift facelift.

Paul Zimmerman/Shutterstock\n\nHathaway said she “wanted a nose job” when she was “growing up” because she didn’t think her schnoz was “good” enough.\n\nHowever, as she got older, she realized that her nose set her apart.\n\n“I think it’s what lets me change my face a lot,” she explained.\n\n“Your face needs to have character if you’re going to be an actor or you’re just kind of a face. You’re not really a person or a personality.”"

With The Mandalorian & Grogu set to arrive next year, fans had been wondering about the next theatrical installment, and now we know it'll be a post-Skywalker Saga standalone titled Star Wars: Starfighter .\n\nNo, this movie won't be connected to the 2001 flight sim video game of the same name. Instead, it will take place \"approximately five years\" after the events of 2019's The Rise of Skywalker . Little is known about the story at this point, though recurring rumors are pointing to Jedi (or at least Force-sensitive characters) being a big part of the plot, even if the movie isn't a direct follow-up to the sequel trilogy. Shawn Levy ( Deadpool & Wolverine ) will be directing from a script written by Jonathan Tropper (The Adam Project). Ryan Gosling (Blade Runner 2049) is now confirmed to star in the project.\n\nThe Star Wars social media accounts also shared a 20-second teaser with the logo and some epic music to announce the May 28, 2027, release date. Despite what the title might suggest, the use of the 'light of the Jedi' symbol right at the center backs up the aforementioned rumors. Watch it below:\n\nStar Wars: Starfighter - Official Teaser Trailer | Star Wars Celebration 2025 - YouTube Watch On\n\nAt some point, renowned Hollywood insider Jeff Sneider teased Daisy Ridley's Rey Skywalker would have a small role in this story , paving the way for her own movie and the post-IX state of the galaxy. That project remains in active development alongside an all-new trilogy and other unrelated theatrical entries , according to today's press release from Disney and Lucasfilm.\n\nMeanwhile, casting seems to be underway for other major roles. Earlier this week, it was reported that Anora star Mikey Madison had passed on the movie , and Jesse Plemons (Civil War) might be one of the big names circling a villainous role. Expect numerous casting updates in the coming weeks and months."

That led to a ton of animosity building up between all three Superstars, as well as Raw general manager Adam Pearce's decision to make it a Triple Threat.\n\nBelair has expressed her belief that she's been treated unfairly, Sky has suggested that she's being overlooked and Ripley has felt slighted due to Bianca's role in her losing to Iyo in the first place.\n\nAll three women can stake claim to the title in some way, and since it is believable that any of them could leave WrestleMania as champion, it should make for an entertaining and unpredictable match.\n\nRoman Reigns vs. CM Punk vs. Seth Rollins\n\nIn the main event of Night 1 of WrestleMania 41, three of the biggest stars in wrestling over the past 20 years will duke it out for supremacy.\n\nRoman Reigns, CM Punk and Seth Rollins all have deeply rooted personal issues with each other, and everything is set to come to a head Saturday when they meet in a Triple Threat match.\n\nPaul Heyman's involvement has added even more intrigue to the situation as well since he is seemingly torn between supporting Reigns or Punk. Also, Rollins has said Heyman owes him a favor since he refrained from stomping The Wiseman's head into the canvas.\n\nHeyman could play a pivotal role in the result of the match, and that could set the stage for some compelling storytelling for weeks and months into the future.\n\nOn top of that, Reigns, Punk and Rollins are three of the best to ever do it, and there is little doubt that they will all be on top of their game in an effort to put on one of the all-time great WrestleMania matches."

            "content": "Minutes before David Cronenberg logged onto Zoom with Jim Jarmusch this past January, news broke—David Lynch had died. The loss of a friend and fellow auteur cast a shadow over their conversation, a stark reminder of mortality, legacy, and the fragile line between life and death. It was an oddly fitting backdrop for Cronenberg, an artist who has spent his career exploring the darkest corners of the human psyche, where flesh, mind, and technology collide. Cronenberg has long been a prophet of our tech-fueled nightmares, and now, at 82, his legacy continues with The Shrouds, a thriller about an app that lets mourners watch their loved ones decompose. Is he a visionary or just a sharp observer? Will tech save or destroy us? And does indie film still stand a chance? Over the course of their conversation, Cronenberg and Jarmusch do their best to find out.\n\n———\n\nWEDNESDAY 2 PM JAN. 15, 2025 TORONTO\n\nJIM JARMUSCH: Hello?\n\nDAVID CRONENBERG: Hi Jim. We can’t see you.\n\nJARMUSCH: I don’t know how to do that.\n\nCRONENBERG: Well, there’s a video thing with a slash through it and you just hit it with your—\n\nJARMUSCH: Okay. Can you see me? You’d probably rather not.\n\nCRONENBERG: I’m very happy to see you. Listen, I just heard that David Lynch is dead.\n\nJARMUSCH: I just heard that five minutes ago. Really a shock. I don’t know what to say. I’m kind of reeling from it.\n\nCRONENBERG: Yeah, me too.\n\nJARMUSCH: What a strange, beautiful gift to cinema and expression in general. I thought the 18-hour version of the reboot [Twin Peaks: The Return] was one of the best things I’d seen in a number of years.\n\nCRONENBERG: Yes. It was pretty hypnotic.\n\nJARMUSCH: Yes.\n\nCRONENBERG: I was flirting with doing a Netflix series, and I was interested to hear how exhausting and crushing it was for him to do. I think it was 18 episodes and he wrote and directed them all. That’s incredible. That’s beyond what we do in movies.\n\nJARMUSCH: What’s even more perplexing to me is he wasn’t able to get his movies financed. But on the basis of Twin Peaks, they supported him in making the 18 episodes. It’s really an 18-hour film in a way.\n\nCRONENBERG: It totally is, yeah.\n\nJARMUSCH: But still, he couldn’t get financing just to make a feature film.\n\nCRONENBERG: Well, I know that you’ve made comments about the film industry being dead. Did you ever think you were really a part of the film industry?\n\nJARMUSCH: No, not really. I consider myself happily marginal.\n\nCRONENBERG: Me too. And David as well. I knew him when he was doing Dune for Dino De Laurentiis, because I was doing The Dead Zone for Dino. So I was in L.A. a lot, and I remember going to Bob’s Big Boy burgers and having lunch with David and talking about all of that. He was already in trouble with Dune. He really liked De Laurentiis, as did I, but he said, “He’s no help.” I think he was being muscled by the studios. And I think the film was cut separate from him.\n\nJARMUSCH: I only met David a couple times—once in an elevator in Cannes at the Carlton Hotel.\n\nCRONENBERG: That’s a classic.\n\nJARMUSCH: He gave me a CD of some trumpet music he had produced, oddly. Then I met him a couple other times. I tried to induce him into making an electric guitar collaboration because he plays very unusual electric guitar stuff, as do I. But he said, “Well, let’s think about that and keep in touch.” It never happened, but I have a great Dino De Laurentiis story. He called me into his office when I was very young, after my second film, Down by Law, and said, “Why do you make amateur films instead of professional films?” And I said, “Can you tell me the difference?” This was in the mid-’80s. He said, “Yes, professional films cost at least $5 million.”\n\nCRONENBERG: [Laughs] He’s right about that in some ways. I started off doing films inspired by the New York underground. I shot them myself, cut them, edited them, and all of that. But when I decided to write a script that might be commercial, I thought, “I have to make money somehow, which means that the film actually has to have a certain budget, and I have to get paid as a writer-director.” That’s when I first realized that I was going to be part of the film industry—even though Canadian filmmaking was, by its nature, independent filmmaking. Certainly independent of Hollywood.\n\nJARMUSCH: I have so many things I want to talk to you about. I know you started with the Toronto Film Co-op, which was underground films more or less, and you were inspired by a friend and mentor of mine, Jonas Mekas.\n\nCRONENBERG: Yes, that’s right. I was at some distance, being in Toronto, but there were times when New York underground filmmakers like [Ed] Emshwiller and the Kuchar Brothers would come to Toronto. There was a theater that had been built into what used to be a post office, called Cinecity. They would do 24 hours of underground films. You’d come out in the morning and have coffee, and then go back in and watch some more. American filmmakers came up to Toronto; it was very inspiring.\n\nJARMUSCH: Wow. The Kuchar Brothers were masters of great titles like Hold Me While I’m Naked.\n\nCRONENBERG: They were so funny. Partly because they were doing parodies of Hollywood stuff, but also because of their unique sensibility. It was the same with Ed Emschwiller’s masterpiece, a really short film called Relativity. Hollywood, of course, was not remotely interested in anything like that. In fact, even the European films, which were also an influence for me, weren’t doing what the underground filmmakers were doing.\n\nJARMUSCH: I grew up in Akron, and as a teenager, we would go to this adult movie theater that would show these Underground Cinema 12 programs. I don’t even know if we had our driver’s licenses. It was just stoners going to see these underground films, but in Akron, it was a big revelation to see things like Chelsea Girls. You may not remember, but I got to have lunch with you some years ago in Cannes on the beach. I just remember laughing a lot and finding you very funny. Your reputation from your films is very dark, but I don’t have that same impression. I have to confess, part of me considers your work comedic.\n\nCRONENBERG: I totally agree with you.\n\nJARMUSCH: I find very funny things in your films. At times, it’s been embarrassing to me in a way, because I’ve been in movie theaters watching your films, laughing out loud, and having people look at me like I’m some kind of sicko. “You think that’s funny? They open a wound and try to fuck it.” [Laughs] So I have to salute you as a semi-comedic filmmaker.\n\nCRONENBERG: I recently met Woody Allen in Paris, and he felt very familiar to me, let’s put it that way. One of the things I say about my new movie, The Shrouds, which is technically a very dark and disturbing movie, is that it’s also very funny. It’s a strange audience at Cannes, as you know. There’s a mixture of local people and producers and distributors. But it’s also a language thing. It wasn’t until it was shown in Toronto and New York that I thought, okay, at least now the audiences really get the humor.\n\nJARMUSCH: Weaving grief with comedy and science—it’s an unusual film, for sure. These days, financing our films has become the worst nightmare. I know that we both got some help recently from Saint Laurent in Paris. I was wondering how that worked for you? For me, it was really a relief—especially them not being film people telling me what I should do. I always have final cut, but they were appreciative of what I did.\n\nCRONENBERG: I agree. I had a very good experience with Anthony Vaccarello. The Shrouds is a Saint Laurent coproduction with other entities. I think they still have things to learn about film production, but they were totally respectful. At one point they were saying, “Oh no, we want to dress everybody in the film, including the extras.” And I said, “Well, we actually don’t dress the extras. They bring their own clothes because we can’t afford to dress them.” I also don’t think they realize the time pressures. In the film business, if you’re going to dress somebody in a Saint Laurent suit, it doesn’t have to be perfectly made. It has to be perfectly fit, and it has to last for the shoot, but it has to get there fast. I think that the time sequences in the fashion business are quite different from filmmaking. So there were those kinds of anomalies and little stutters. But it was very interesting for me. In fact, in two weeks I’ll be at a Saint Laurent fashion show in Paris, because the Cinémathèque Française is doing a massive retrospective of my stuff. It’s kind of scary. They have everything I’ve ever done, including shorts that I did for the CBC [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation] 50 years ago on two-inch videotape, which was the standard then. As luck would have it, Saint Laurent is doing a fashion show there.\n\nJARMUSCH: I’ll see you there. I’m going also.\n\nCRONENBERG: Oh, you’re going to be there? That’s fantastic.\n\nJARMUSCH: Any excuse to go to Paris, but also I have to do a few things with them, a little documentary.\n\nCRONENBERG: I did like the idea that you and I have become runway models late in life.\n\nJARMUSCH: [Laughs] Well, my 19-year-old daughter was impressed.\n\nCRONENBERG: That’s important.\n\nJARMUSCH: I had the same experience. I have the wonderful costume designer Catherine George, and I was very specific with Saint Laurent: It’d be great if they made all the clothes, but I’m very particular, and they have to suit the characters, and I’m not taking things as a Saint Laurent commercial, as much as I do respect their designs. Anthony is really a brilliant designer, but it worked out because they said, “Okay, if you need the clothes to be distressed or whatever, we’ll just do that too, or you can do it. Or if you want something in a color we don’t make, or a style that isn’t currently made by us, we will create it.” And they did that for all my characters. You would never know that all the clothes are from Saint Laurent.\n\nCRONENBERG: Fantastic.\n\nJARMUSCH: I know you’re a writer, and you’re interested in certain writers that are very important to me, like Burroughs, and Philip K. Dick, Nabokov, and, of course, J.G. Ballard. I love Crash very much. One reason is the idea of sex being as tied to procreation as control, something that Crash addresses in a very important way. J.G. Ballard is now considered almost prophetic, as is Burroughs, and as are you, in a way.\n\nCRONENBERG: Weirdly.\n\nJARMUSCH: [Laughs]\n\nCRONENBERG: I don’t think of art as prophecy, and I don’t think my purpose in making the art that I do is to be a prophet. But if you are an artist, you perhaps have antennae that are more sensitive than other people’s, or at least you’re paying more attention. There are signals in the zeitgeist that are suggesting what is happening beyond people’s normal comprehension. And so if you’re sensitive to that and you allow that to take control of some of what you’re doing, you’re going to anticipate things that will happen. People especially talk about Videodrome that way, as anticipating the internet and so on. When you see the movie, it’s kind of undeniable.\n\nJARMUSCH: Your interest in science and technology runs through your work. Did you study science?\n\nCRONENBERG: I did a year of organic chemistry at the University of Toronto. I really thought that I could be a writer who was also a scientist, like Isaac Asimov, who was a genuine scientist, legitimate, but also a prolific science-fiction writer. But then I realized that I would rather invent the science than do the years of drudgery and research. Of course, inventing the science immediately meant that I’m making genre movies. I saw that you recently made a zombie movie.\n\nJARMUSCH: It doesn’t quite suit the expectation of the genre. It’s a comedy. I also made a vampire movie that wasn’t really a vampire movie—it’s a love story. But I’m glad you chose your own approach to science. How do you feel about the denial of science today?\n\nCRONENBERG: It’s shocking and bizarre. Can we blame the internet? Science has always been politicized in one way or another, because if you’re building the atomic bomb you can do that.\n\nJARMUSCH: It’s not new.\n\nCRONENBERG: It’s always about politics, but we thought that since the Enlightenment, we’d come away from that. But it’s getting to be the Middle Ages out there in terms of people’s understanding of science. All because somebody changed their mind about a particular Covid vaccine. But it’s an innate part of science that you try stuff. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. It’s not a conspiracy.\n\nJARMUSCH: I’m just shocked that knowledge and enlightenment is now projected politically as being a negative thing.\n\nCRONENBERG: Intellect in general is being completely disparaged, and it allows all kinds of strange philosophers to emerge in the meadow of life. A lot of them are religious or pseudo-spiritual as a kind of replacement for science. But there’s so much technology that the survival of the planet depends on right now. Spiritualism by itself is not going to help.\n\nJARMUSCH: I’m with you. I think we’re both atheists on that level. I know you’ve said that social media is horrifying, horrible, and also helpful and positive. It’s very contradictory.\n\nCRONENBERG: That makes it very human. That’s always been my understanding of technology: It’s not a thing from outer space, it’s a projection of us. It can be hideously awful, murderous, and deadly, and it can also be fantastic and brilliant and life-affirming.\n\nJARMUSCH: Do you feel that way about A.I.? I mean, it’s incredibly helpful but also incredibly dangerous. It’s how the tools are deployed. They’re not innately positive or negative.\n\nCRONENBERG: That’s absolutely true. If you put A.I. in charge of your nuclear stockpile, then you’re going to have some problems. [Laughs] But if you ask it to write a précis of a novel that you’re interested in, it can be quite nice.\n\nJARMUSCH: I’m not so sure A.I. wouldn’t make a more rational decision about nuclear deployment than some of the people currently in charge. [Laughs] I was thinking recently about how teenagers are glued to their phones. Their phones are an extension of their beings. And I was reading about how bees can communicate over long distances. I started to wonder, maybe this technology is an adaptation. If you take the phones away from teenagers, they don’t know where they are anymore. [Laughs] Is there a Darwinian aspect where it’s helpful in that way?\n\nCRONENBERG: I think the phone has really altered the nervous systems of human beings. I often say to people, “Wait a second, I’m going to look this up,” because I’ve out- sourced a lot of my memory to my phone. I just read a really interesting article talking about why losing a memory is actually an evolutionarily positive thing. You have to be able to forget for your mind to function. So having a phone that you can outsource some important memories to is not bad, but it has to have a balance with life in the real world. You have to eat real food; you have to make love to real people.\n\nJARMUSCH: Well, that’s changing too, I guess. [Laughs]\n\nCRONENBERG: The specifics of it will change. But they don’t necessarily have to change for the worse.\n\nJARMUSCH: I don’t know. I get so depressed by these humans.\n\nCRONENBERG: Humans can be very depressing, yeah. That’s why I really love babies, because they haven’t learned how to be destructive yet. [Laughs]\n\nJARMUSCH: Now we’re getting a little negative. But when I get depressed by the state of the world, I try to appreciate the very strange phenomenon of having a consciousness. I think, “Life on earth is such a fragile, brief thing.” The fact that we’re even here talking to each other is remarkable, and therefore something to celebrate. My friend Joe Strummer from the Clash always used to say to people, “When you get really low, you only have to remember one thing: You’re alive!” So I try to hold that close. But lately, I don’t know.\n\nCRONENBERG: You might be able to find some people who walk around thinking they’re dead. That’s the problem.\n\nJARMUSCH: Right. Your films have tenderness and warmth in them in places, even though critics don’t always project those qualities onto you. The end of Crimes of the Future is tender, warm, and moving to me.\n\nCRONENBERG: Our relationship with the critics, of course, is kind of contentious.\n\nJARMUSCH: I like that quote—I think it’s Godard—it goes, “Critics are soldiers too, but they’re firing on their own troops.”\n\nCRONENBERG: The idea that my filmmaking has always been cold was the critique of The Shrouds. I never felt that I was making cold films. I always wanted to avoid sentimentality and cliched emotional hooks, but cold? There are one or two critics who’ve jumped on that. And I ignore them, of course.\n\nJARMUSCH: They like to find these catchphrases to plaster on you. It makes it easier for them. “Well, the state of the industry’s getting complicated, and now the cinema is dying.” Years ago, before we had streaming services, if we wanted to see a film by, say, Jean Eustache, we’d say, “Oh, it’s going to play at the Bleecker Street Cinema two months from now.” It was an event. Now, my drug of choice is the Criterion Channel. I can see these things whenever I want and that’s great. But there’s something also missing that we can’t put back again.\n\nCRONENBERG: I stopped going to the cinema many years ago. Part of it is my hearing. I watch everything with subtitles, including movies in English. Also the parking is not so great in Toronto.\n\nJARMUSCH: [Laughs]\n\nCRONENBERG: So, I only see movies in real theaters every once in a while, mostly at film festivals, and I’ve found that the projection isn’t always so great. I remember being in Venice onstage with Spike Lee and some others. He was talking about the Cathedral of Cinema, the whole religious aspect of it. And I said, “Spike, I’m watching Lawrence of Arabia on my watch, and there are a thousand camels there. I can see every one of them.” I was joking, but what I meant was, I don’t find the cinema experience all that great. Maybe it’s because I’m older. I don’t feel that communal thing.\n\nJARMUSCH: Right.\n\nCRONENBERG: I do find that people talking about streaming can be very passionate in the way that we were passionate in the movie theater after we saw a film. So it’s different, but I don’t think it’s worse. I also don’t miss working with film. The cutting and editing was a nightmare for me. It was very restrictive. You have so much more control now. And of course, we are control freaks to a certain extent, if you’re making a film.\n\nJARMUSCH: Yes!\n\nCRONENBERG: I have nostalgia for the old films, but I don’t have that Spielberg-esque need to actually shoot on film.\n\nJARMUSCH: I feel the same. And I know David Lynch was very vocal about this, too. The magic of film and the light passing through, that’s all very beautiful, and we appreciate it, but I would never shoot on film again. I don’t have the budget. Quentin Tarantino is lucky to get the money to do that. I can’t. I don’t see the point.\n\nCRONENBERG: Normally I just do one or two takes. In the old days, we would say, “Okay, let’s do one for the lab,” because the lab would always destroy one take in the chemical bath or the sprockets in the machine would tear.\n\nJARMUSCH: Yeah. Well, I don’t know anything else to talk about besides the horror of trying to raise money for our work. [Laughs]\n\nCRONENBERG: That’s the real horror film, to follow some poor filmmaker trying to get the money together.\n\nJARMUSCH: I will say, I’ve had my same American crew for a long time, but it’s very, very difficult with the union here. They almost crushed me, so now my next films will all be shot in France. I’m trying to get a French passport, in fact. Shooting here is prohibitive. It’s stressful, it’s traumatizing.\n\nCRONENBERG: Well, France might end up being the last bastion, having such a diamond-hard cinema history. Different from anywhere else in the world, really.\n\nJARMUSCH: In America, I’m an indie filmmaker, and I’m happy to be that. But in France, I’m an actual film director.\n\nCRONENBERG: And a Saint Laurent model.\n\nJARMUSCH: Along with David Cronenberg. [Laughs] I’ll see you in Paris next week.\n\nCRONENBERG: This was a lot of fun. Thank you.\n\nJARMUSCH: And let’s say hats off to David Lynch, too.\n\nCRONENBERG: For sure.\n\n———\n\nGrooming: Alanna Chelmick using MAC Cosmetics.\n\nPhotography Assistant: Jasmine Wi-Afedzi."

            "content": "Warning: this post contains light spoilers for The Wedding Banquet.\n\nBowen Yang bares it all in Andrew Ahn's joyous remake of The Wedding Banquet.\n\nWithout giving too much away, an unexpected hookup occurs between the Saturday Night Live breakout's character, Chris, and an unlikely person in the adaptation of Ang Lee's 1993 queer cult classic (though it won't come as too much of a surprise for those familiar with the original feature). Yang fully committed to the scene, which sees his character awaking in horror the morning after and briefly flashing his bare butt as he jumps out of bed.\n\n\"It was something that for anyone other than Andrew Ahn, I would've been like, 'Let's talk about coverage,' and 'I'm not going to show nip,' and 'I'm not going to show butt,'\" Yang tells Entertainment Weekly of the memorable scene. \"I would've gotten really granular about that. But there was just something about playing the comedy of that scene, which is such a shocking moment. And then you're supposed to believe that these two people are so good about moving past it and then immediately having to de-queer the house in a way that cleanses the stakes.\"\n\n\n\nKelly Marie Tran, Lily Gladstone, Han Gi-chan and Bowen Yang in 'The Wedding Banquet'.

Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free newsletter to get the latest trailers, celebrity interviews, film reviews, and more.\n\n\n\n\"There was no hesitation in the end because it just felt so integral,\" Yang adds of the scene. \"I just think it's a very important part of the story, that you see these two people jump out of bed, scream at each other, and then go, 'This doesn't mean anything. Okay, bye!'\"\n\nAnd while butt pads have played a considerable role in Hollywood lately, Yang shares that the butt on screen was the real deal. \"You will be able to tell from the flat topography of my buttocks that I bare it all,\" he quips.\n\nAhn's remake remains true to Lee's original film while also incorporating some modern sensibilities. As Chris, Yang is the commitment-phobic boyfriend of Min (Han Gi-chan), the closeted heir to a Korean corporate empire working in the States on a visa that will soon expire. When Chris rejects his marriage proposal, Min hatches a plan with their close friends Angela (Kelly Marie Tran) and Lee (Lily Gladstone), a couple struggling with a series of unsuccessful and costly IVF treatments as they try to start a family: a sham marriage to Angela in order to obtain his green card. In return, Min will pay for Lee's next round of IVF treatments. Chaos ensues when Min's formidable grandmother (played by Yuh-jung Youn) visits from Korea and insists on throwing her grandson the ultimate wedding banquet.\n\n\n\nHan Gi-chan, Yuh-jung Youn, and Kelly Marie Tran in 'The Wedding Banquet'. Luka Cyprian/Bleecker Street\n\nThough the cast all met \"cold on set,\" Yang says, \"it was all really fortuitous that we got to, through Andrew's direction, accelerate this connection, this intimacy, and this sense that these were four people who knew each other for a long time.\"\n\nHe adds, \"I think one of the highest compliments that I've gotten from someone who's seen the film is, my friend Matt Rogers said, 'I can tell the layout of the house. That's how drawn into that world and this group of friends I am.'\"\n\n\n\nFor Yang, starring in the remake feels like a meaningful, full-circle moment. \"I had seen [the original] in college. I would go to the library at NYU and I would just post up with the DVDs — oh my gosh, this is really aging me,\" the comedian jokes. \"I remember being pretty blown away by this idea that films that you didn't realize were out there have been impactful in the culture and in cinema. I just remember watching it at a time when I thought my parents would never accept this thing about me. I'd come out to my parents, then I went back in the closet after conversion therapy. It gives me this check-in point now to where my family just accepts that part of me and embraces it.\"\n\nThey even pester him about his love life now, Yang shares. \"I never thought we would get there. When I think back on the movie, I do think about the strides that have been made just within my family alone.\"\n\nThe Wedding Banquet is in theaters April 18.\n\n"

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT! This story contains details from Thursday’s crossover episodes of Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU on NBC.\n\nDick Wolf’s two flagship shows on April 17 staged their third crossover since May of 2022 by chronicling the brutal rape and murders (what else?) of several marginalized women in the Big Apple. The two-hour event on NBC also marked the first time that Maura Tierney — who joined L&O this season as Lt. Jessica Brady — was required to kick some actual cop ass. (Her character acknowledges that “it’s been a minute” since she last got physical with a perp).\n\nHere, Tierney looks back on the 24th season so far and explains how the crossover episodes were unexpectedly reminiscent of her days playing Abby Lockhart on ER.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDEADLINE How’s it been joining Law & Order? How has the pacing felt compared to the other series you’ve done?\n\nMAURA TIERNEY Well, it’s very different because the show is half law, half order. [Laughs] So a lot of times it’s really fast because they’ll pile all of the precinct scenes in one or two days. The pace is very quick on those given days, but then sometimes I won’t work a couple of times a week. So I have more free time than, say, when I was on ER. And the scenes are much more concentrated. The other day I had three interrogations back to back. Or maybe four, I’m not sure. It can be hectic, but it’s fun.\n\nDEADLINE What’s it been like living in this darker world?\n\nTIERNEY Well, it’s quite literally darker. The set is so dark. I think the show looks very cool, but it’s dark in there. It’s also dark because someone dies every week, but I think there’s an excitement to the chase. It’s dark when they have younger people die, but a lot of times the investigations outweigh the tragedy of the loss. That’s really on the guest stars’ back. They have a lot. That’s a hard job.\n\nDEADLINE What feels refreshing about this in comparison to your previous series?\n\nTIERNEY I love working in New York. The Affair started in New York, but the last two seasons we moved to L.A. until the very end. I really like working here. I like working outside in the seasons. The other day we shot in front of Radio City. I don’t like the dark stage as much.\n\nDEADLINE Does L&O always attract a crowd?\n\nTIERNEY It’s very chill. They’ll be like, ‘Hey, what’s up? How you doing?’ They’re very friendly, but nobody stops and stares. They’re very New Yorker. That’s good. Nobody gawks.\n\nDEADLINE In the beginning, did you have a big say in Jessica Brady’s look?\n\nTIERNEY The costume designer is very collaborative, but there’s not so much we can do. Jessica is a lieutenant, so she has a dress accordingly. So I’m usually wearing a suit or a jacket or some version of that, but she has to look professional all the time. We don’t see her at home. I have no idea how that character would dress at home. I did start out wearing sneakers but that did not work out because the guys are so tall. I needed some height on me. I needed some boots to get up there with them.\n\nDEADLINE You have a fun line in the crossover episode where you say you ‘haven’t played that rough in a minute.’ So have we not seen Jessica be all badass in previous episodes?\n\nTIERNEY No, and it was so funny because I have said I want to do stunts. But then I was like, oh, careful what you wish for because I fail. Mariska Hargitay is really good at it. But I was very tentative. We had to beat this guy up and my stunt double was actually my stunt double on ER, which is wild. I saw her and I was like, ‘oh my God, I’m so glad you’re here.’ I was feeling miserable with pretending to kick the guy in the back of the knee and I needed to use my stomach because, I don’t know, I was afraid to hurt another actor. He wasn’t a stunt man. It was fun, but I won’t say I excelled at it.\n\nDEADLINE I can’t believe you needed a stunt double on ER.\n\nTIERNEY Well, my character Abby got beat up sometimes. She got beat up by an abusive husband. We also had to go in front of a green screen once and be dropped from a helicopter.\n\nDEADLINE Brady’s dynamic with Benson was interesting. I started to wonder if we would see these two powerful women clash. How would you describe the differences between Benson and Brady?\n\nTIERNEY Benson has emotions and Brady doesn’t show many. I just think that Benson is a little more empathic than mine. I don’t think it was as much about powerful women clashing. They clash in terms of how they do the police work. They don’t clash over what their goals are. So it wasn’t just two powerful women sniping at each other. It was very balanced in terms of sometimes, a kinder approach works and sometimes, a tougher approach works. The characters were figuring that out throughout those two episodes. Both of us realized they could learn from one another. I wouldn’t be surprised if the crossover happened again. We had a really good time. It was very fun.\n\nDEADLINE You two shared the screen before, right?\n\nTIERNEY It was a similar clash over the best way to get the job done, and my character was more about by any means necessary. Benson was not. So we sort of built on that.\n\nDEADLINE What can we expect from the finale?\n\nTIERNEY The finale is really great. It involves more of Odelya Halevi’s character, Maroun. It’s more about her story. I don’t have as much to do in the finale, but there’s a slight cliffhanger, which the show doesn’t really do. So I think that that’ll be fun for the audience.\n\nDEADLINE And most importantly, you’re coming back, right?\n\nTIERNEY The show hasn’t been officially picked up yet but yes, I will be back if the show comes back."

            "content": "LAS VEGAS -- Jey Uso recorded a memorable moment in WWE history when he eliminated John Cena to win this year's Royal Rumble. It was unexpected, but mostly received well by fans who were touched to see Uso's hard work rewarded. But as the shock wore off and his WrestleMania program with Gunther developed, the audience split into two camps.\n\nThe live audience is captivated by Jey's command on the microphone and theatrical entrance. The vocal online fanbase has been mostly disinterested in the world heavyweight title program, pinning most of the blame on Uso.\n\n\"It's been a lot, Uce,\" Jey told CBS Sports. \"You hear them and see them out there.\n\n\"'He's not championship material because he does three moves, he's from this family and that's why he gets these opportunities.' It's all good because I busted my ass to get here.\"\n\nJey's position on the card eclipses his brother, Jimmy, who doesn't have a WrestleMania match. In February, Jey got emotional about the subject, explaining to CBS Sports that his brother is experiencing the journey at his side. The sentiment never felt more true than when Jimmy was inserted into the world title program. Jimmy led with confidence as Jey's character struggled with self-doubt. This was conveyed most clearly when Jimmy slapped Gunther in Jey's honor. It sounded like a gunshot, eliciting countless online reactions.\n\nWWE WrestleMania 41 card: John Cena, Roman Reigns, CM Punk and five matches lapsed fans need to know for 2025 Shakiel Mahjouri\n\n\"You had to be there behind the camera,\" Jey said. \"I knew it was coming, so I acted like I ran up the stairs, but I ran back down to see the slap. When I say he really slapped the shit out of him, he really slapped the shit out of him.\"\n\nJimmy was punished for his defiance. Gunther viciously attacked Jimmy on the following week's Monday Night Raw, bloodying and battering him. Jey was zip-tied to the ring ropes and forced to watch his crimson-faced brother in agony. It was a graphic scene that added much-needed weight to an otherwise dull storyline. As a performer, Jimmy selflessly gave his twin brother the best shot at success.\n\n\"He didn't say two words, just 'OK.' He was down for whatever,\" Jey said.\n\n\"I've never seen my brother bleed like that. When I'm out there, when we're in front of the cameras, it's real. Everything is real. The emotions. All that. I'm so happy my brother was down to do whatever was needed. He helped catapult my storyline to the top, I believe.\"\n\nCheck out the full interview with Jey Uso below.\n\nJey's name is on the billing for WrestleMania 41 this weekend. Jimmy's is not. The brothers are enjoying striking out on their own, but have no desire to hide their connection. Whatever solo accolades they achieve are a collective win for the record-setting tag team champions.\n\n\"We had eight to 10 weeks to drag this story out,\" Jey said. \"What if this Jimmy stuff happened in the first two weeks? Now we lose momentum. We knew the end game. We knew we had to stretch it out, so we stretched it out to where it got a little [slow] and now we shot back up.\n\n\"We're running it here. I knew what kind of promo I needed to cut within the last two weeks. I knew there'd be a moment for that, and I'd need to deliver, and I did. It was real.\""

            "description": "Willem Dafoe tells IndieWire about making 'The Legend of Ochi' in a new interview.",
            "content": "Sometimes, making great art is an exercise in disappointing your heroes.\n\n“I remember Gene Hackman, one of his advices to me when I worked with him was, ‘Never work with a first-time director,'” Willem Dafoe told IndieWire while discussing his new film “The Legend of Ochi,” which hails from first-time director Isaiah Saxon. “Obviously, I didn’t follow his advice, but may he rest in peace.” (Dafoe and the late Hackman starred together in 1988’s “Mississippi Burning.”)\n\nDafoe currently has his pick of coveted roles from elite auteurs — in 2024 alone, he starred in films from Robert Eggers, Yorgos Lanthimos, Tim Burton, and Jason Reitman. So it takes a lot for a new filmmaker to dazzle him. But Saxon and his directorial debut “The Legend of Ochi” were something special. A throwback to fantasy epics like “The NeverEnding Story,” the film immerses viewers in an ocean of matte paintings and puppets to depict the fictional town of Carpathia, where villagers live in fear of an adorable species called Ochi. Nobody loathes the creatures more than Dafoe’s Maxim, who blames them for his wife’s death and assembles an army of young boys to exterminate the magical beings from the Carpathian forests.\n\n‘The Legend of Ochi’ Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nWhat convinced Dafoe to don World War I armor and chase after a cute Gremlin-like creature with a bunch of kids? The actor said it was a combination of Saxon’s animation pedigree — the director has spent decades applying his distinct stop-motion approach to music videos through his studio Encyclopedia Pictura — and the director’s visceral passion for the material that proved to be irresistible.\n\n“When they have a certain passion and their approach is very personal, I think this is something that I don’t know for a fact, that Isaiah has been living with for a long time,” Dafoe said. “It had a strong impulse behind it; it wasn’t just another film. You like to get people when they’re trying to make something that they’ll die if they don’t make it.”\n\nDafoe has always been an actor who embraces a new challenge, so he delighted in the opportunity to use a puppet as one of his primary scene partners. He explained that the petite Ochi puppets were actually part of a large rig operated by six people — a phenomenon that only accentuated his character’s perception that these tiny creatures were actually monsters that deserved to be feared.\n\n“Physical is where I live. Acting is all about doing things if you ask me,” Dafoe said. “And because it’s kind of this low-tech stuff, like with the puppets, for example, it’s interesting when you’re doing a scene with the Ochi, you’re doing the scene with, basically, six people rolled into one. It’s fun when you’re playing across to see all that’s going behind animating this creature. And of course, you’re not concentrating on that, but you get that energy of this very distinct, very concentrated six people or whatever it is, operating this puppet that’s reacting to you. So it’s a very engaging place to be. It sounds strange. You’d think it would be otherwise that maybe you’d fall out, but in fact, it sucks you in.”\n\n‘The Legend of Ochi’ Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nIn some ways, acting alongside a team of puppeteers brought Dafoe back to his days doing experimental theater with companies like The Wooster Group, in which he performed in the 1980s. While the actor never worked with puppets on stage in such a large capacity, his background in experimental performance gave him a comfort level with projecting human emotions in response to actions that were not necessarily cued by other human characters.\n\n“Sometimes, we’d be working in very unconventional performance modes. Sometimes, we do our cueing or have some kind of reference offstage that we’d have to follow,” he said. “So that has a similar kind of concentration, where you have an outside reference, and you’re going to that, and that kind of gives you a super concentration. That’s a very good thing to have when you are performing because the world drops away and you’re doing what you’re doing. There’s no flourish, there’s no extra, there’s almost no ego. You are really giving up… It’s like an athlete. You are concentrating on following that thing, and that’s where everything in your body is going. And that way you get a real pure presence.”\n\nAn A24 release, “The Legend of Ochi” opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday, April 18, before expanding nationwide on April 25."

Director Matt Shakman’s feature offers a new take on the superhero quartet who made their first comic book appearance in 1961.\n\nFantastic Four: First Steps stars Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm/The Human Torch and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm/The Thing.\n\nIn the new footage for the 1960s-set project, Reed Richards and Sue Storm learn that they are expecting a baby, spurring a complicated response. “We can do this,” Kirby says.\n\nOur heroes face threats from Galactus but are determined to stay united, even as the public begins to lose faith in them. “We will face this together,” Kirby adds. “We will fight it together — as a family.” Toward the end of the trailer, Julia Garner’s Silver Surfer briefly glides across the screen to offer a warning.\n\nThe latest version of the screenplay is from Eric Pearson, who also worked on Marvel’s forthcoming Thunderbolts*. The First Steps cast includes Ralph Ineson as Galactus, along with Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich and Natasha Lyonne.\n\nFollowing an unreleased Roger Corman-produced feature in the 1990s, the Fantastic Four hit the big screen with director Tim Story’s 2005 movie that starred Chris Evans, Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd and Michael Chiklis as the titular group. Although critics were unimpressed, the movie did well at the box office and spawned a 2007 sequel.\n\nThe team was rebooted for Josh Trank’s 2015 feature starring Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B.

            "content": "We rarely think about food in relation to our mental health. We worry about it leading to health issues, such as cardiovascular or gastrointestinal problems, but did you know that different foods and beverages can exacerbate anxiety spikes and even bouts of depression?\n\nIn fact, there are foods and drinks that therapists and psychiatrists, who have spent their careers advising people on mental wellness, typically avoid ― or consume in moderation ― for the sake of their mental health.\n\nTake this knowledge with a grain of salt. These foods and drinks can be consumed once in a while and not be correlated with negative mental health consequences. Just remember that, as with everything, moderation is key.\n\nMultiple Cups Of Coffee Or Espresso\n\nFor some people, too much caffeine can have a negative impact on anxiety. “If a person is prone to feeling anxious or has multiple stressors, know that over-caffeination causes an increased cortisol response and can lead to adrenal fatigue, a recipe for persistent stress and burnout, not to mention sleep issues,” said licensed clinical psychologist Brittney Jones.\n\nResearch suggests that consuming more than 250 milligrams of caffeine per day (that’s roughly 2 1/2 cups) could have a negative impact on anxiety, so Jones does her best to keep her coffee consumption under that amount. And for people who get jitters or anxiety spikes from coffee, consuming caffeine in the form of matcha can be a great alternative since it gives many people a feeling of calm alertness thanks to a compound called L-theanine.\n\nDiet Soda\n\nIf you’re looking out for your mental health this summer, you might want to keep your diet soda consumption to a minimum. “Everyone loves a cold diet soda on a warm summer day, but the health concerns outweigh the benefits,” said Jacques Jospitre, Jr., a board-certified psychiatrist and co-founder of SohoMD. “While we know high-sugar sodas aren’t great for our health, diet sodas might actually be even worse. Many of these contain phenylalanine, which is an added chemical well-known to mess up brain neurochemistry by stopping the proper production of serotonin and dopamine, two molecules we need for good mood.”\n\nAdditionally, these drinks have artificial sweeteners like aspartame, “which is a known neurotoxin and may raise stress hormones like cortisol, as well as increase the amount of free radicals in the brain,” Jospitre said.\n\nAlcohol\n\nWhile a drink or two once in a while isn’t the worst thing, Danielle Tucci, a licensed professional counselor and the founder of Live Better Therapy Solutions, said she does her best to avoid alcohol when considering her mental health."

Most were detected in rural areas of the Tolima and Meta departments, the Amazon basin, and the Magdalena River region.\n\nCases have also been reported in areas where the virus has not been historically located, such as the coffee-growing Caldas region, according to the president’s office.\n\nSome regions were already under alert before it was extended nationwide due to the expected surge in travel during Easter weekend. Travel to some zones with a critical virus presence will also be restricted under the health emergency.\n\nYellow fever is a disease that is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected mosquitoes.\n\nMany people do not experience symptoms from the disease, while others experience fever, muscle pain, headache, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, according to the WHO. In most cases, symptoms disappear after three to four days.\n\nHowever, some patients enter a second phase of illness in which they develop jaundice and abdominal pain, among other symptoms. Half the patients who enter this phase die within seven to 10 days, according to the WHO.\n\nThere is no specific anti-viral drug treatment for yellow fever; the WHO advises that patients rest, stay hydrated, and seek medical attention as needed.\n\nThe office of President Gustavo Petro urged Colombians to receive the single-dose vaccine, which is free and can be administered to anyone older than nine months.\n\nMedical teams would be deployed to administer vaccines in the affected areas, the office announced.\n\n“In two months, the entire Colombian population must be vaccinated against yellow fever,” Petro said on X. “We must do this, and our health system must guarantee it.”\n\nPetro added that he would declare an economic emergency due to the situation.\n\nPetro’s office said that the Ministry of Health and the National Health Institute have deployed more than 20 immediate response teams to investigate the spread of the disease.\n\n“We have already asked each territorial entity to have a hospital to which people suffering from the disease can go, so that we can exercise clear and definitive control over them from there,” Health Minister Guillermo Alfonso Jaramillo stated to local media.\n\nSome opposing political figures argued that the government’s response to the disease comes too late.\n\n“It is unacceptable for the government to declare a health and economic emergency for yellow fever when the crisis started six months ago,” said Senator Paloma Valencia from the Democratic Center party. “Decisions should have been made a long time ago to prevent deaths.”\n\nPetro will hold a broadcast cabinet meeting on emergency measures to prevent the spread of the virus and release a new report on the progress of the disease on Monday."

Submit it here!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI divorced my children’s dad for a “bad” reason in their minds, and they are so angry, and I’m not sure how to work through it with them. My kids are 18 and 20, and in college. In their narrative (and their dad’s), I filed for divorce the instant the youngest went to college because I hated their grandma and wanted her to die alone. To me, it’s more complicated. In 2023, my MIL moved in with us for emergency caregiving for Alzheimer’s. She and my husband weren’t close. He was a surprise youngest kid and she openly resented him for it in childhood, although she apologized a few years ago. It seemed like he was trying to make it up to her by taking her in. His older siblings suggested a nursing home, and offered to help arrange it. She could afford it, even. Instead, he moved her in without consulting me, and she needed a lot of help. She could be pretty mean even before the dementia removed her filter, so once that happened, things really deteriorated.\n\nAfter two years of burnout, anger, and exhaustion, I fell out of love. We had multiple conversations and even marriage counseling about the ways his unilateral decisions were hurting our marriage. The last straw was his refusal to the idea of a home health aide after she accidentally set a small fire and needed daytime supervision. Instead, he suggested I take FMLA (he’s already used his) or go part-time to stay home with her. I realized he wasn’t even trying to look out for his mom’s best interests, or mine.\n\nI filed for divorce, and he immediately told our kids that it was because I hated Grandma and didn’t want to care for others. It hit on a painful point for me and the kids; I was the primary earner with long hours for all of their middle school years because their dad was unemployed. I never got to spend as much time with them as I wanted, and I know they resent that. So to them, it feels like more of the same. What can I do to make room for their pain but not get excommunicated?\n\n—Miserable\n\nDear Miserable,\n\nYour reasons for leaving the marriage are quite fair; your husband refused to do what was best for his mother (out of a field of options that not everyone has) and instead, chose a situation, without your input, that was untenable for you. Of course, that doesn’t stop your kids from being hurt over the divorce, but you aren’t responsible for their pain. Your children are young adults; they’re old enough to handle the truth about why you split from their father. Be honest with them.\n\nTalk to them about what life was like with your MIL and their father’s refusal to get her the sort of help she needs. Acknowledge that the idea of you “refusing” to be around may be triggering because of their childhood experiences, but let them know you did everything within reason to make things work, until you simply couldn’t anymore. Be empathetic and let them know that you know the divorce hurts them; give them the space to express their grief while still standing up for yourself. It may take them some time to understand, but hopefully, they’ll come to respect the way you advocated for yourself.\n\n—Jamilah"

(AP) — A Texas doctor who has been treating children in a measles outbreak was shown on video with a measles rash on his face in a clinic a week before Health Secretary Robert F.

Little mild fever. Spots came in the afternoon. Today, I woke up feeling good,” Edwards said in the video.\n\nMeasles is most contagious for about four days before and four days after the rash appears and is one of the world’s most contagious diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctors and public health experts said Edwards’ decision to go into the clinic put children, their parents and their community at risk because he could have spread it to others. They said there was no scenario in which Edwards’ conduct would be reasonable.\n\nKennedy met with Edwards about a week after the video was posted by Children’s Health Defense, the group Kennedy led for years until December. In an April 6 post on X, Kennedy said he “visited with these two extraordinary healers,” including Edwards and another doctor, and praised their use of two unproven treatments for measles.\n\nEven as measles has exploded in Texas and spread across the country, Kennedy, the nation’s top health official, has declined to consistently and forcefully encourage people to vaccinate their children and remind them that the vaccine is safe. Kennedy’s post drawing attention to Edwards is inappropriate but unsurprising given Kennedy’s record, said Dr. Craig Spencer, a medical doctor who is also a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

A spokesperson for Kennedy said he is not anti-vaccine and that he is “committed to improving children’s health in America and has re-deployed resources to Texas to help with the current outbreak.” He did not answer why the health secretary chose to meet with and praise Edwards rather than any of the other doctors in West Texas who have been treating children in the outbreak.\n\nEdwards told The Associated Press in an email that he “interacted with zero patients that were not already infected with measles” during the time he was infectious. “Therefore, obviously, there were no patients that were put in danger of acquiring measles since they already had measles.”\n\nBut Jessica Steier, a public health scientist, said the video shows Edwards in the room with people who do not appear sick, including parents of sick children and the people who visited the clinic from Children’s Health Defense. She also questioned what steps Edwards was taking to confirm people were sick with measles, rather than relying on guesswork.\n\nSteier, who runs the Science Literacy Lab and co-wrote an article about Edwards’ conduct, said while there may be some extraordinary emergencies where it would be appropriate for a sick doctor to work, this is not one of those situations because there is no shortage of providers who are not infected. She also pointed out that the video shows Edwards was not wearing a mask.\n\n“You have the HHS secretary lifting him up,” she said. “You know, it’s so, so dangerous. I really feel for the people who are on the ground.”\n\nChildren’s Health Defense has sued a number of news organizations, among them the AP, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.\n\nKennedy’s promotion of a doctor who has touted unproven measles treatments is “wholly irresponsible” but is in line with Kennedy’s long public record of anti-vaccine views, said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He said Kennedy has carried those views to his new job as the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n“He’s not the director of Children’s Health Defense anymore. He’s responsible for the health and well-being of children in this country,” Offit said. “It’s an emergency, but Kennedy is not treating it that way.”\n\n___"

            "content": "There are so many factors that can influence how we perceive others, which in turn can determine the people we choose as platonic friends or romantic mates. We certainly make snap judgments based on physical appearance, but scent can have a powerful influence, too. According to a new paper published in the journal Scientific Reports, two heterosexual women meeting for the first time rely partly on scent to judge whether they want to be friends with each other, deciding within minutes—practically at first whiff—whether there is friendship potential.\n\nSocial olfactory research largely stems from evolutionary psychology, specifically the work of Swiss biologist Claus Wedekind in 1995. Subtle chemical signals from pheromones are known to play a role in attraction in many species. Scientists had already found evidence in fish and mice that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, which are critical for immune system function (and useful in determining tissue compatibility for transplants, for instance)—showed a marked preference for sexual partners with different MHC genes, perhaps as a way of keeping the gene pool well-mixed and protecting against inbreeding.\n\nWedekind introduced the so-called \"sweaty T-shirt\" method to study the possible role of MHC in mate preferences in humans. Male participants wore the same T-shirt for two days, which were then placed in identical boxes. Women participants then smelled each shirt and indicated which ones they found most sexually attractive. Wedekind found that the women overwhelmingly preferred the T-shirt smells of men who had the most dissimilar MHCs to their own. The only caveat: The preference was reversed in women who were taking oral birth control.\n\nThere have been many other smelly T-shirt studies since Wedekind published his findings, even inspiring the trend of \"pheromone parties\" for amorously inclined singles. The psychologists who authored this latest paper were more interested in studying the role of olfactory cues in platonic friendships. Smelly T-shirt studies often try to isolate a person's \"natural\" odor, devoid of scents from toiletries, pets, and other environmental factors. The Cornell team focused on so-called \"diplomatic\" odor, which incorporates all those other factors.\n\nWhy can’t we be friends?\n\n“It’s not just perfume,” said co-author Jessica Gaby of Middle Tennessee State University. “It’s your dietary choices. Are you a cat person or dog person? What laundry detergent do you use? All these judgments come together into what we call ‘diplomatic odor.’ You live in this odor space–does it match with the odor spaces of the people you interact with?”"

            "description": "Growing air leaks, and the lack of a deorbit plan top the list of concerns for the aging space station.",
            "content": "The International Space Station (ISS) has been orbiting Earth since 1998, housing groups of astronauts in the microgravity environment around 250 miles above the surface of the planet. All of that time in space has taken a toll on its aging hardware, and the space station is due to retire within the next few years. Until then, however, safety experts are warning of long-running issues that threaten the safety of the ISS, and the crew on board.\n\nDuring a meeting of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) held on Thursday, members of a NASA safety panel stated that there are growing risks threatening the space station as it nears the end of its use, SpaceNews reported. “The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence,” Rich Williams, a member of the panel, said during the meeting.\n\nAt the top of the list of growing risks is a leak where air has been escaping at an increasing rate from a tunnel that connects a docking port to a Russian module. In 2019, Russia’s space agency Roscosmos reported the detection of an air leak found in the vestibule (named PrK) that connects a docking port to the Russian Zvezda module, which the space agency had launched to low Earth orbit in July 2000. The rate of air that has been leaking from Russia’s Zvezda module had doubled from one pound of air per day in 2019 to a little over two pounds around a week before the launch of the Progress MS-26 cargo spacecraft in February 2024.\n\nBoth NASA and Roscosmos have been monitoring the air leak since then, and officials from the two space agencies are scheduled to meet later this month to update mitigation efforts for the growing safety concern, according to Williams. A report issued in late 2024 elevated the air leak to the highest level of risk based on its likelihood and severity. In the meantime, the source of the leak remains unknown. The astronauts on board the ISS are prepared to close the hatch to the service module when access is not required in order to minimize the amount of air lost, as well as to isolate the leak itself from the rest of the space station.\n\nAnother safety issue addressed during the meeting is the lack of a deorbit plan for the ISS in case of an emergency. NASA is in the process of solidifying a plan to ditch the nearly one-million pound space station in 2030, sending it flying through Earth’s atmosphere to mostly burn up from the heat, with its remaining bits ending up at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in a controlled reentry. But as of now, NASA has no emergency plan in place to deorbit the ISS, and that’s a big problem. If NASA is forced to destroy the space station ahead of its retirement, then it increases the risk of ISS debris falling on inhabited areas.\n\n“If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the [U.S. Deorbit Vehicle] is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude,” Williams said, according to SpaceNews. The panel highlighted other issues with the ISS, including having enough spare parts for life support systems on board and delays with cargo deliveries. Williams blamed these issues on “ISS budget shortfall.”\n\n“As programs near final phases, it is tempting to assume less resources will need to be available,” Williams said. “For the ISS, it is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle is safely reentered.”"

            "content": "Consuming too much cooking oil could increase your chances of cancer, a study from Weill Cornell Medicine found.\n\nThe study was published on March 14 in Science, after researchers noticed that linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid found in vegetable and seed oils, can enhance an aggressive subtype of breast cancer called triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).\n\nTNBC, known for its rapid growth and spread, has limited treatment options. It is more common in women under the age of 40 and accounts for 10% to 15% of all breast cancers, with a 77% survival rate according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nLinoleic acid is deemed essential for mammals, playing crucial roles in supporting inflammation regulation, skin health and cell membrane structure, according to an article from The Conversation. However, since the 1950s, people have been eating too much of this fat when using seed oils in fried and ultra-processed foods.\n\nDr. John Blenis, the study’s senior author and a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell, told The New York Post that “the findings do not warrant blanket avoidance of seed oils, but suggest moderation and selectivity, especially for high-risk individuals.”\n\nLinoleic acid can be found in seed oils made of canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, soy, sunflower, safflower and rice.\n\nThese oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids but lower in omega-3s. This imbalance can lead to inflammation in the body, The Post explained.\n\nTherefore, the best way to stay healthy, Blenis explained in the New York Post article, is to have “a balanced, whole-food diet” because it’s considered “an important cornerstone of cancer prevention” and is “a strategy everyone can adopt.”\n\n12aa"

            "content": "The first patient has been enrolled in an expanded access program (EAP) trial evaluating MN-166 (ibudilast), Medicinova’s oral anti-inflammatory drug, in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nEAPs, also known as compassionate use programs, allow patients with serious or life-threatening conditions to access investigational therapies outside of clinical trials when no other alternatives are available.\n\nIn addition to providing a greater number of patients with potentially lifesaving or life-extending treatment, EAPs offer opportunities to collect additional clinical data on experimental therapies.\n\nThe MN-166 program will enroll about 200 patients at several locations in the U.S. who are not eligible for the ongoing COMBAT-ALS trial (NCT04057898), including those with more advanced disease, to evaluate the therapy’s safety and efficacy in a broader patient population.\n\nIt is funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), under the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act (ACT for ALS). ACT for ALS was signed into law in 2021 and provides $100 million annually through fiscal 2026 for efforts to improve ALS prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\nRecommended Reading Nonprofit biotech develops tool to help ALS patients find clinical trials\n\nTargeting proteins to reduce inflammation\n\n“We are honored to support this EAP trial, which will provide MN-166 to more individuals in advanced stages of ALS who are not eligible to our current Phase 2/3 COMBAT-ALS trial,” Yuichi Iwaki, MD, PhD, president and CEO at Medicinova, said in a company press release.\n\nIn ALS, the nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movements, called motor neurons, become progressively damaged and die. The exact causes of ALS remain unclear, but abnormal brain inflammation is thought to play a central role.\n\nMN-166 is an oral small molecule designed to reduce that inflammation and boost the survival and growth of nerve cells by targeting several different proteins involved in those processes. It is expected to slow the progression of ALS and potentially extend survival.\n\nThe ongoing Phase 2b/3 COMBAT-ALS trial is evaluating MN-166 in about 230 adults who began experiencing ALS symptoms up to 1.5 years before entering the study.\n\nParticipants are being given either MN-166 or a placebo twice daily for 12 months, after which all will be able to enter an optional, open-label extension and receive the experimental therapy for an additional six months.\n\nAn interim analysis from the first 217 patients, presented last year, suggested that MN-166 may slow ALS progression, extend survival, and reduce the decline in key physical functions. These include bulbar functions like speech and swallowing, fine motor skills such as writing, and gross motor abilities like walking or climbing stairs.\n\nThe data remain blinded, meaning investigators don’t know which patients are receiving NM-166 and which are on a placebo, so more data will be needed to know for sure if the experimental therapy has an impact on those outcomes.\n\nMN-166 has received orphan drug designation in the U.S. and European Union to treat ALS. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also granted it fast track designation. These designations are intended to support and expedite the development of promising treatments by offering incentives such as regulatory support, market exclusivity, and potential expedited review."

There are over 10 million new cases of dementia globally each year.\n\nBut a study published last year suggests up to 13 percent of people diagnosed with dementia in the US may have a misdiagnosis and are instead left struggling with a condition that can be treated.\n\n\"Health care providers [must be] made aware of this potential overlap between dementia and hepatic encephalopathy, which is treatable,\" said Virginia Commonwealth University hepatologist Jasmohan Bajaj in July 2024.\n\nHepatic encephalopathy – cognitive impairment caused by liver failure – impacts more than 40 percent of patients with advanced liver disease (cirrhosis). The brain impairments it causes are hard to distinguish from dementia.\n\nOur livers regulate the levels of most chemicals in our bodies, from filtering them from the blood to aiding with digestion.\n\nAside from the well-known liver-damaging effects of alcohol, other risks to the liver include the hepatitis virus, high cholesterol, obesity and diabetes, stress, and aging. But if caught early enough and with the right treatment, damage to our livers can be reversed.\n\nMuch of this can be mitigated through changes in diet and behavior, and there are even more potential drug treatments on the horizon as well.\n\nIn fact, treatment of hepatic encephalopathy has resolved cognitive impairments in at least two patients who had been diagnosed with dementia.\n\n\"He is a different person!\" the wife of one of the patients notes, after his memory loss, falls, tremors, and hallucinations were all resolved.\n\nA recent study in mice suggests that even the impacts of aging on the liver may be reversible if caught early enough.\n\n\"We've shown that aging exacerbates non-alcoholic liver disease… and by reducing this impact, we can reverse the damage,\" explained Duke University hepatologist Anna Mae. \"You are never too old to get better.\"\n\nIn an earlier 2024 study, Bajaj and colleagues reviewed the medical records of 177,422 US veterans diagnosed with dementia between 2009 and 2019.\n\nNone of them had been diagnosed with liver disease, but the team found over 10 percent had high fibrosis 4 (FIB-4) scores, an index to measure liver scarring, meaning they were very likely to have cirrhosis.\n\nIn the new study, Virginia Commonwealth University biostatistician Scott Silvey, Bajaj, and colleagues repeated this review with 68,807 medical records of patients from a national database who aren't veterans, to see if their earlier results reflected the general US population.\n\nTo their surprise, even more patients with high FIB-4 scores were found in this population – almost 13 percent.\n\n\"The prevalences and determinants of a high FIB-4 are striking, including a greater proportion of patients who were not white in the high FIB-4 group,\" explain Silvey and team.\n\n\"While we did not study the specific factors behind these disparities, a lack of access to therapy or medical care in both dementia care and comorbidity care could contribute.\"\n\nOnce our livers start to malfunction, it stresses other tissues in our bodies, including kidneys, pancreas, and heart, as well as our brains. So it makes sense to prioritize our liver health.\n\n\"This important link between dementia and liver health emphasizes the importance of screening patients for potentially treatable contributors to cognitive decline,\" said Bajaj.\n\nThis research was published in The American Journal of Medicine.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was first published in July 2024."

Credit: Neuroscience News\n\nWhile upsetting thoughts and experiences can disrupt one’s ability to focus attention while performing everyday tasks, translating this phenomenon to the laboratory has remained elusive.\n\nIn a new study, researchers from Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine and VA Boston Healthcare System have shown that when people are sustaining attention, distractions that are upsetting or unpleasant are most likely to disrupt that focus.\n\nThe researchers hope these findings will assist in treating anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders.\n\n“We found that negative distractions disrupted ongoing task performance as well as impacted the participants’ mood by making them feel worse,” explained corresponding author Michael Esterman, PhD, principal investigator in the VA’s National Center for PTSD and BU associate professor of psychiatry.\n\nTwo groups of approximately 60 participants performed a series of tasks (called the gradCPT) requiring them to sustain their visual attention for about 10 minutes without a break, while photos of distractions would sometimes fade in and out in the background on a video monitor.\n\nThese visual distractions could be upsetting (a crying baby), neutral (a chair), or positive (a smiling baby).\n\nThe researchers found that when the backgrounds were upsetting, participants were both slower and less accurate at the sustained attention task.

Behavioral Research Methods\n\nAbstract\n\nCharacterizing the effects of emotional distraction on sustained attention and subsequent memory: A novel emotional gradual onset continuous performance task\n\nThis study examines the impact of emotional distraction on sustained attention using a novel gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT). Sustained attention is a foundational cognitive process, vulnerable to both internal (endogenous) and external (exogenous) disruptions.\n\nReliable, validated paradigms to assess internal sources of variation in sustained attention have been used to characterize basic aspects of attention as well as individual differences and neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nHowever, sustained attention can also be disrupted by external distraction, especially highly salient distractors, due to their affective and/or arousing nature. Markedly less work has been conducted to develop reliable and validated paradigms to study these effects on sustained attention.\n\nThis study introduces a novel task, the emogradCPT, to characterize the impact of emotional distractors (background images) on the ability to sustain attention during an emotionally neutral task (digit discrimination task).\n\nAcross two experiments and three rounds of data collection, we demonstrate that emotionally negative distractors robustly and reliably disrupt ongoing ability to sustain attention, reflected in reduced accuracy, and slower RTs, relative to neutral, positive, and no distractor conditions.\n\nFurther, we validated the task by correlating objective and subjective measures of distraction, as well as demonstrating the impact of these distractors on downstream memory encoding and affect.\n\nMaking these data and tools publicly available, we encourage the use of this paradigm to inform future basic, clinical, and neuroimaging studies of affective interactions with ongoing goal-directed attentional processes."

            "content": "Recent research points to protein-rich food choices as powerful drivers of health. Many people are now asking whether a meat-heavy approach to protein is truly the best strategy when it comes to living longer.\n\nThe recent findings show that countries with higher levels of animal-based protein see lower mortality rates among children under five, yet plant-based protein is linked with longer lifespans for adults.\n\nThe study was conducted out by PhD candidate Caitlin Andrews and her team, led by Dr. Alistair Senior at the University of Sydney.\n\nFrom plants to meat protein\n\nPopulations worldwide seem to be trading vegetables for meat. Researchers have observed that animal-based protein consumption has climbed across various regions over the past several decades. More societies are gravitating toward protein-dense foods derived from cattle, poultry, and pigs.\n\nThese shifts are not uniform, though. In several corners of the globe, chickpeas, beans, and other legumes are still mainstays, along with certain dairy and egg products. In resource-constrained nations, individuals often rely on whatever is the most affordable form of protein.\n\nMeat protein lowers child death rates\n\n“For the under-fives, a food system that supplies large amounts of animal-based proteins and fats lowered rates of infant mortality,” said Andrews.\n\nIn places where young children miss out on ample nutrition, extra amounts of animal-based protein can be tied to better early survival rates.\n\nOne explanation involves the nutrients found in eggs, dairy, and meat. These foods contain essential amino acids, iron, zinc, and vitamins that help children grow. They also provide energy-dense fat, which supports early development.\n\nFamilies who live in impoverished settings, however, often struggle to access such staples.\n\nPlant protein helps adults live longer\n\n“For adults, plant-based proteins increased overall life expectancy,” said Andrews.\n\nHigher plant-based protein intake appears to bring key advantages. Diets built around legumes, peas, lentils, and nuts are linked with fewer chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease.\n\nAdults who rely on beans, lentils, or tofu may also get more dietary fiber. That fiber supports normal digestion and can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, too much red or processed meat is often linked with harmful effects that might shorten lifespan.\n\nGood fats early, less later\n\nAnother interesting aspect involves fat. Research suggests that in infancy and early childhood, certain animal fats might help reduce malnutrition.\n\nLater in life, though, cutting back on high-fat products can aid weight management, possibly easing issues like type 2 diabetes and hypertension.\n\nFoods loaded with saturated fat may disrupt the balance if combined with processed sugars and a sedentary lifestyle. Such combinations might trigger an inflammatory state and higher vulnerability to illnesses.\n\nThis pattern emphasizes how dietary composition can be more important than any single nutrient.\n\nA higher cost for the planet\n\n“Protein is a crucial part of the human diet, but as eating habits change and developed countries look to decarbonize, where we get our protein from has come under greater scrutiny,” noted the research team.\n\nMeat production draws attention for environmental reasons. Livestock farming typically requires more land and water compared to growing legumes or grains.\n\nThose aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions often look to pea or chickpea farming as lower-impact methods. This is sparking interest in alternative proteins, such as plant-based meat.\n\nBut these shifts need to be carefully approached, given how vital animal-sourced protein appears to be for child development.\n\nShifting protein needs\n\nWhat each person puts on the plate can differ by budget and culture. For families with small children, variety may be the safest bet. Adults seeking to improve their longevity might gain from swapping out meat for beans, peas, or other plant-based sources.\n\nSome individuals find plant protein more economical, while others view meat as a valued tradition. Experts advise that local resources and medical concerns shape the ideal balance.\n\nThe best approach might be a mixed plan, adjusting as people move from childhood into later stages of life.\n\nRethinking protein for global well-being\n\nThese results highlight a pattern: keep an eye on total protein intake first, then prioritize more plant-based sources past childhood.\n\nFuture innovations may focus on improving vegetarian options for children at risk of malnutrition. Researchers also stress the need for more accessible programs, especially in areas with low food security.\n\nShifting the global menu can pose challenges. It involves policy support, agricultural reforms, and nutrition education. The end goal is to see infants thrive and older people enjoy extra years, while also safeguarding natural resources.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Communications.\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

Neural Encoding of Intent: Single neurons in the motor cortex reflect the experience of intention.\n\nSingle neurons in the motor cortex reflect the experience of intention. Brain-Machine Integration: The study leveraged implanted electrodes and machine learning to decode and act on motor intentions in real time.\n\nSource: PLOS\n\nResearchers led by Jean-Paul Noel at the University of Minnesota, United States, have decoupled intentions, actions and their effects by manipulating the brain-machine interface that allows a person with otherwise paralyzed arms and legs to squeeze a ball when they want to.\n\nPublished in the open-access journal PLOS Biology on April 17th, the study reveals temporal binding between intentions and actions, which makes actions seem to happen faster when they are intentional.\n\nSeparating intentions from actions was made possible because of a brain-machine interface. The participant was paralyzed with damage to their C4/C5 vertebrae and had 96 electrodes implanted in the hand region of their motor cortex.\n\nAs they tried to squeeze a ball, a machine-learning algorithm looked at all the signals coming to the electrodes, and learned which activity pattern meant “squeeze” (close) and which meant “relax” (open).\n\nOnce learned, the machine could send an electrical signal to the appropriate hand muscles, allowing the participant to squeeze the ball, which then delivered a sound. On average, the participant perceived the time from intention to action to be 71 ms, which was slightly faster than the real time duration.\n\nThe heart of the study involved systematically removing each part of the chain of events. By randomly stimulating the participant’s hand to squeeze the ball, the researchers were able to eliminate intentions. In this case, actions were judged to occur much later.\n\nOn the other hand, when the participant tried to squeeze the ball, but actions were prevented by not stimulating the hand, intentions were perceived to happen much earlier if the sound was still played after the machine decoded the intention. Perceived timing did not change if the sound was not played.\n\nThese results indicated a compressed temporal binding between intention and action. Recordings from the electrodes, which normally cannot be done in humans, showed that the motor cortex encodes these intensions.\n\nThe authors add, “The work builds on a long tradition trying to establish the temporal relationship between moving, the onset of the subjective experience of intending the movement, and the neural correlates of this intention.\n\n“While there have been quite a number of non-invasive studies on this topic, only a single study prior to our was able to measure single neurons – the gold-standard in neuroscience – in humans while asking them to report when they first ‘felt the urge to move’.”\n\nThe authors continue, “This prior work (Fried et al., 2011) showed that certain brain areas (all in the frontal cortex) know about the intention to move up to a second prior to when we experience that intention. You can imagine this created quite the debate regarding whether humans have free will or not.\n\n“Our study contributes to this debate by recording single neurons in the primary motor cortex.

PLOS Biology\n\nAbstract\n\nNeuronal responses in the human primary motor cortex coincide with the subjective onset of movement intention in brain–machine interface-mediated actions\n\nSelf-initiated behavior is accompanied by the experience of intending our actions.\n\nHere, we leverage the unique opportunity to examine the full intentional chain—from intention to action to environmental effects—in a tetraplegic person outfitted with a primary motor cortex (M1) brain–machine interface (BMI) generating real hand movements via neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES).\n\nThis combined BMI-NMES approach allowed us to selectively manipulate each element of the intentional chain (intention, action, effect) while probing subjective experience and performing extra-cellular recordings in human M1.\n\nBehaviorally, we reveal a novel form of intentional binding: motor intentions are reflected in a perceived temporal attraction between the onset of intentions and that of actions.\n\nNeurally, we demonstrate that evoked spiking activity in M1 largely coincides in time with the onset of the experience of intention and that M1 spike counts and the onset of subjective intention may co-vary on a trial-by-trial basis.\n\nFurther, population-level dynamics, as indexed by a decoder instantiating movement, reflect intention-action temporal binding.\n\nThe results fill a significant knowledge gap by relating human spiking activity in M1 with the onset of subjective intention and complement prior human intracranial work examining pre-motor and parietal areas."

            "content": "Local and state health officials confirmed Thursday that Michigan is experiencing its first measles outbreak since 2019.\n\nAn outbreak is defined as three or more related cases, which has been confirmed in Montcalm County, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Mid-Michigan District Health Department, which serves Clinton, Gratiot and Montcalm counties.\n\n“This outbreak underscores how contagious measles is and how quickly it can spread,” said Natasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive.\n\nThe agencies said seven cases have now been confirmed across the state in 2025 — one each in Oakland, Kent, Macomb and Ingham counties — in addition to three in Montcalm County. Officials said the Montcalm cases are not related to any others across the state.\n\nHealth officials said the highly contagious disease is best prevanted through vaccination.\n\n“The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine remains our best defense, and two doses of MMR offer 97% protection against measles,\" Bagdasarian said in a statement. \"We urge all Michigan residents to check their vaccination records to ensure they are up to date with the MMR vaccine.”\n\nThe disease is spread through direct person-to-person contact and through the air. People can contract measles by being in a room where an infected person has also been up to two hours after they left, according to the CDC.\n\nAnyone who believes they may have been exposed should call their health care provider before seeking treatment so health care workers can take steps to ensure other individuals are not infected.\n\nAccording to the CDC, measles can cause serious complications like pneumonia and encephalitis. Experts say the disease is potentially deadly, especially for very young children, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems.\n\nAs of April 10, there have been 712 confirmed cases of measles across the U.S., including seven outbreaks. Most of the cases are in Texas, which has seen 561 cases since late January, according to the state's department of health and human services. Two Texas children have died due to the disease.\n\nThe nationwide case count is the highest since 2019, when 1,274 individual cases were confirmed in 31 states, according to the CDC.\n\nmreinhart@detroitnews.com\n\n@max_detroitnews"

            "content": "How climate change could affect arsenic in rice\n\n2 days ago Share Save Amanda Ruggeri Share Save\n\nAlamy Scientists around the world have been working on ways to reduce arsenic levels in rice (Credit: Alamy)\n\nRice is a staple food for billions of people around the planet, but a new study suggests climate change may increase arsenic levels contained within the grain.\n\nRice is a staple food for more than half of the global population. It is consumed on a daily basis by more people than either wheat or maize, also known as corn.\n\nSo it is with some concern that scientists have unveiled a recent finding: that as carbon emissions rise and the Earth continues to warm, so too will arsenic levels in rice.\n\nYet, consuming even low amounts of inorganic arsenic through food or drinking water can lead to cancers and a range of other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\n\nResearchers around the world have been working on ways to reduce the levels of arsenic in rice – and in the meantime, there are ways of cooking it that can extract some of this harmful element from grains (see the box further down the story for more).\n\nBut a new study of inorganic arsenic accumulation has found it may become a greater problem due to climate change. The researchers grew 28 different strains of paddy rice at four different locations in China in experimental conditions over a 10-year period.\n\nThey found that arsenic levels in the rice increased as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere and temperatures rise. Then epidemiologists modelled how, at current rice consumption levels, these arsenic levels could affect people's health. They estimated that the corresponding increases in arsenic levels in rice could contribute approximately 19.3 million more cancer cases in China alone.\n\nGetty Images Arsenic in rice could increase as CO2 levels and temperatures continue to rise (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\"Inorganic arsenic has been shown in more studies than I can throw a stick at to be a carcinogen, to have adverse effects with respect to pulmonary health, with respect to cardiovascular health – it's a long laundry list,\" says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the study. \"And two metrics of climate change – the increase in CO2 and the increase in temperatures – are resulting in greater amounts.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that the researchers' worst-case scenario is beyond the high emissions \"business as usual\" scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body on climate change. The most dire predictions assume temperatures rise by 2C, and CO2 levels increase by an additional 200 parts per million between 2025 and 2050. But it does provide a snapshot of what may happen to rice crops in the future if carbon emissions are not reduced.\n\nWhile the researchers focused on locations in China for their experiments, they say such impacts are likely to be seen in rice grown in regions including Europe and the US too, as inorganic arsenic is common in rice grown around the world.\n\n\"We're not the first ones to look at CO2, we're not the first ones to do temperature – but we're the first ones to put them together in the field. And that's what stunned us,\" says Ziska.\n\nOf course, the study has limitations, aside from the metrics chosen for the 2050 scenario. For one, it assumed that people will continue to consume the same amount of rice per person in 2050 that they were eating in 2021, even though, as countries get wealthier, their rice consumption tends to drop. On the other hand, it also assumed that people would continue to eat far more white rice than brown rice, like they do now. Because of how it is processed, white rice contains less inorganic arsenic than brown rice – so a shift in the other direction could make numbers even worse.\n\nStill, this is \"one of the most comprehensive studies\" ever done on the topic, says Andrew Meharg, professor at the school of biological sciences at Queen's University Belfast, and a long-time researcher of rice and arsenic, who was not involved in the study. \"This is as robust as you’re ever likely to get.\"\n\nGetty Images In flooded rice paddies, anaerobic bacteria in the soil turn to arsenic due to the lack of oxygen (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nHumans have known for hundreds of years that arsenic is toxic. Its tasteless, colourless, odourless nature even made it a preferred method for dispatching enemies in the courts of ancient Rome and medieval Europe. But in single doses at trace amounts, it does not cause poisoning.\n\nOver the last few decades scientists have discovered that even lower amounts of arsenic can cause health impacts when exposure happens chronically over a lifetime.\n\nThis is particularly true of inorganic arsenic, which is more readily able to attach to biomolecules in the human body where it can cause harm. While naturally occurring in rocks and soils, inorganic arsenic can be a byproduct of activities like mining, coal burning and other industrial processes. (Read more about why \"natural\" doesn’t always mean better).\n\nAnd, outside of drinking water, the main source of dietary exposure to arsenic worldwide is rice. In regions that tend to have little arsenic in their groundwater, like Europe, rice is the single biggest source of dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic.\n\nLowering the arsenic in your rice If you want to lower your arsenic exposure from rice, there are a few things you can do. First, some types of rice have more inorganic arsenic than others. White rice has a lower inorganic arsenic content than brown rice but has less nutritional value. Basmati rice has less inorganic arsenic than other varieties. And rice from certain areas, including east Africa, has less arsenic than rice from other areas, including parts of the US, Europe, and south-east Asia. Researchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK also recently discovered a way of cooking rice that can remove 50% of the arsenic in brown rice and 74% from white rice. They recommend first parboiling the rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining. Then add fresh water and cook it on a lower heat to absorb all the water. The UK's Food Standard's Agency recommends rinsing your rice before cooking and then boiling it in six parts water to one part rice before draining and rinsing again.\n\nThe problem comes down to how around 75% of the world's supply of rice is grown, says Ziska – in irrigated paddy fields.\n\nRice tends to be choked out by weeds. But rice can grow in water, while weeds cannot. \"That gives rice a big advantage over weeds, and you don't have to spray, you don't have to hoe,\" Ziska says. \"But there's a downside. The downside is, because it's flooded, there's no oxygen in the soil.\" In these conditions, anaerobic bacteria in the soil then turn to arsenic as an alternative to oxygen to accept electrons as they respire. These bacteria then facilitate reactions with other minerals in the soil that make the arsenic more bioavailable and easier for the rice plants to absorb through their root systems.\n\n\"When you shift the soil by making it less having less oxygen, arsenic comes into its own,\" Ziska says. It changes the microbiome of the soil in such a way that arsenic-loving bacteria become more prolific.\n\nAnd this is what he and his fellow researchers predict will get worse as temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise. \"This bacteria in the soil is getting more carbon. It's getting warmer. And it's being more active,\" Ziska says. \"It really is a synergistic effect. You're making the little bacteria happier with warm, warmer temperatures, but you're also giving them more carbon, and they just go crazy.\"\n\nZiska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.\n\nGetty Images Parboiling rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining can help reduce arsenic levels (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhat worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be. In January 2025, the US's Environmental Protection Administration updated their assessment of inorganic arsenic's \"cancer potency factor\", taking into account all new research on arsenic and disease. Their latest assessment found that \"arsenic is a lot more potent of a carcinogen than we previously believed\", says Keeve Nachman, professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a co-author of the rice and arsenic study. In particular, there is now good evidence that arsenic not only raises the risk of skin cancer, but lung and bladder cancers.\n\nFor individuals, the risks are slight. For example, the latest EPA review found that consuming 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day – or 7.8 micrograms for a 60kg person – would raise the risk of developing bladder cancer by about 3% and diabetes by about 1%.\n\nBut across populations, particularly those that eat a lot of rice, these small risks can add up. And, if the predictions made by Ziska and his colleagues turn out to be correct, this could significantly impact disease in populations that depend on rice as a staple over the decades to come.\n\nInorganic arsenic If everyone consumes 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day, for example, the EPA calculates that – compared to consuming noinorganic arsenic – an additional eight people out of every 10,000 get bladder cancer, an additional 10 out of 10,000 get lung cancer, an additional 110 per 10,000 get ischemic heart disease, and an additional 129 out of 10,000 develop diabetes. The amount of inorganic arsenic in rice varies enormously. But one study found that the global median amount is 66 micrograms per kg of rice. The EU set a limit in 2023 on inorganic arsenic in rice at 200 micrograms per kg of rice.\n\nSo, aside from cutting emissions and keeping temperature rise as low as possible, what can be done?\n\n\"We can't pretend that we're going to take rice off the table. That's not feasible,\" says Nachman. As well as an important food tradition, rice is important to people living in poverty, some of whom get up to half of their daily calories from rice alone. \"But we need to do something differently.\"\n\nGetty Images Rice is a staple food for billions of people worldwide (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThere is also interest in trying to breed varieties of rice that take up less inorganic arsenic, but this hasn't yet panned out, researchers say.\n\nThere also needs to be better monitoring and regulation of arsenic exposures in food, researchers say. \"Policymakers have been dragging their feet for decades on this,\" says Marham.\n\nCurrently, the US Food and Drug Administration does not regulate arsenic levels in rice but has set a limit of 0.1mg/kg of rice intended for consumption by children. In 2023, the EU set new limits on inorganic arsenic in rice at 0.2mg/kg of rice while China has proposed introducing similar limits. But these recommendations don't take into account the fact that some communities eat far more rice than others.\n\n\"There are ways in which to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic, but it will require a fundamental change in management of how rice is currently being grown,\" Ziska says. \"It really needs attention, because it affects so many individuals globally.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week."

            "content": "You're probably taking over-the-counter painkillers incorrectly\n\ntoggle caption Photo illustration by Beck Harlan/NPR\n\nWhen hit with a headache or fever, people often reach for over-the-counter painkillers like acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as their first line of defense.\n\nUsed correctly, these drugs can be safe and effective for pain relief. That means following the instructions on the label and the advice of a health care provider.\n\n\"But that's not how we take these medications in real life,\" says Trisha Pasricha, a physician and instructor at Harvard Medical School. Some people take too much pain medication too quickly, misdiagnose an ailment and take the wrong drug, or unknowingly take multiple pain relievers at the same time.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOne study published in 2018, for example, found that 15% of over 1,300 survey participants exceeded daily NSAID dosages, and most participants didn't recognize that all the products they were taking were NSAIDs.\n\nThese behaviors can lead to serious side effects, from bloating and nausea all the way up to heart attack and stroke, Pasricha says.\n\nTo prevent these risks, the health care professionals we spoke to for this story say it's important to get to know the painkillers in your medicine cabinet. Here are 10 things they wish you knew about these drugs.\n\nPhoto illustration by Beck Harlan/NPR\n\n1. Acetaminophen is usually the better choice for fevers, says University of California San Francisco (UCSF) clinical pharmacist Candy Tsourounis. Commonly known as Tylenol, it's thought to reduce fever and relieve minor aches and pains by raising your body's pain threshold and regulating your body temperature. It's also gentler on the body than NSAIDs are.\n\n2. NSAIDs are generally considered more effective than acetaminophen for pain relief, Tsourounis says, especially for inflammatory pain like muscle aches. While acetaminophen is thought to work only on the central nervous system, NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (like Advil or Motrin) or naproxen (like Aleve) work throughout the body to reduce inflammation, pain and fever.\n\n3. Taking too much acetaminophen at one time or too many doses close together can cause liver damage, Tsourounis says. So stick to 3,000 milligrams of the drug at most per day, and don't mix it with alcohol, which is also hard on the liver.\n\n4. NSAIDs carry risks to the gut and the heart. Common side effects include stomach pain, heartburn and bloating. You can also experience more serious damage like ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding or kidney damage if you take NSAIDs at too high a dose or even just for too long a time period, Pasricha says. And non-aspirin NSAIDs have the potential to raise your blood pressure. Every NSAID has a different max dose, so pay attention to your labels.\n\ntoggle caption Photo illustration by Beck Harlan/NPR\n\n5. If you're not sure which painkiller to use or how much to take, talk to a pharmacist, says Blamoh Twegbe, pharmacy manager at UCSF outpatient pharmacy. \"Please utilize us. That's what we're here for!\" They can help you make an informed decision by asking about your type of pain and chronic conditions and by checking any potential drug interactions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n6. There's a limit to how much pain NSAIDs can treat, Pasricha says. If you take more than the recommended dosage or more than one type of NSAID at once — for example, combining Motrin and Aleve — you're increasing your risk of side effects without getting any additional pain relief. If you feel your over-the-counter (OTC) drugs aren't working, talk to a doctor or pharmacist instead of ignoring the warning label.\n\ntoggle caption Photo illustration by Beck Harlan/NPR\n\n7. If you're habitually reaching for the same OTC pain medication, talk to your health care provider. For example, if you're taking naproxen every day of your period every month because of muscle cramps. Pasricha says that pain might signal a larger underlying health problem that could be better treated with prescription medication, lifestyle changes or both.\n\n8. Beware of accidentally overmedicating with a combination OTC drugs. Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are often included in a lot of other sick-day remedies, like migraine medication, allergy pills or all-in-one cold and flu medicines, Twegbe says. So when you're not feeling well, double-check your labels before assuming you need a dose of Tylenol on top of those cold-relief meds.\n\ntoggle caption Photo illustration by Beck Harlan/NRP\n\n9. Alternate between NSAIDs and acetaminophen to manage major pain and reduce side effects. If you're suffering from the flu or nursing a new injury and need strong and steady pain relief, switching between acetaminophen and an NSAID like ibuprofen every few hours can be a safe and effective way to help you cope until your symptoms subside, Twegbe says. Just make sure to follow recommended dosages and dosing times for each medication.\n\n10. Think beyond pills. Because over-the-counter pain relievers are so readily available, people often forget that pills aren't the only option when suffering from minor aches and pains, Pasricha says. Many NSAIDs and other analgesics are available in topical form, like creams or patches, and can offer similar relief without the potential side effects to your gut.\n\nThere are also nonmedication remedies, like heating pads to ease back pain or exercising in water for arthritis. Talk to your doctor about your alternatives, Pasricha says. \"They might even control your pain more reliably than just taking medicine.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

It’s good for everyone.\n\nStaircase strolls: Just walk up and down a few stairs at a casual pace. You’ll get your steps in and help digestion too\n\nMake it casual. Make it enjoyable. Maybe even call someone during that walk or listen to a short podcast.\n\n20 mins of extra walking every day slashes cardiovascular disease risk\n\nYou must have heard about walking 10,000 steps a day. But what if you were told that just 2 minutes of walking—yes, a chill, post-meal kind of walk—could actually help you fight off some serious health issues like diabetes and heart disease?In today’s fast-paced, work-from-home, always-in-a-rush lifestyle, we rarely move around after meals. We eat and then slump into the couch, scroll endlessly, or get back to our laptops. Over time, this sedentary behavior builds up and silently starts messing with our metabolism, blood sugar, and heart health .But here’s where the magic of mini walks comes in.Sitting down after a full meal feels like a natural reflex. But here’s the not-so-fun truth: right after you eat, your blood sugar levels spike, especially if your meal was rich in carbs. This spike requires insulin to kick in and shuttle that sugar into your cells. Now, if you're just lounging around post-meal, your muscles aren’t helping out much. They’re inactive, which means your body takes longer to bring those blood sugar levels down. Over time, this constant spike-crash cycle can lead to insulin resistance. That’s a direct ticket to type 2 diabetes. Add to that the extra calories that don't get used and end up being stored as fat, often around your belly—aka the danger zone for heart disease.Now, studies are showing that just 2 minutes of light walking after eating can dramatically reduce your post-meal blood sugar levels. It sounds almost impossible that such a tiny amount of effort can have such a big impact, but science backs it up. One major study published in Sports Medicine in 2022 analyzed several trials and concluded that people who took short walks (2 to 5 minutes) after meals had significantly lower blood sugar levels compared to those who just sat around. Even just standing helped a little, but walking was clearly better. When you walk, even casually, your leg and core muscles start contracting and your body starts using up the glucose floating around in your blood.Walking right after meals helps avoid that post-lunch slump. You stay more alert, energetic, and less bloated. And all of this goodness happens in just two minutes.Diabetes and heart disease often go hand in hand. When your blood sugar is out of control, it affects your blood vessels, your blood pressure, and your overall cardiovascular health. The more sugar floating around unnecessarily, the more damage to your arteries over time. Leisure walking improves circulation, lowers blood pressure, and reduces triglycerides (those nasty fats in your blood). It also reduces inflammation, which is a key culprit in both heart disease and insulin resistance. Even short walks, when done regularly, can help your heart stay young. You don’t need a treadmill or running shoes. Just your feet and a little commitment.Here are a few easy ways to sneak in your 2-minute stroll:Start with 2 minutes within 60 to 90 minutes after a meal, ideally sooner. The earlier you move after eating, the more effective it is in flattening that blood sugar spike. Of course, if you have more time and energy, walking for 10-15 minutes gives even better results. But remember: 2 minutes is still infinitely better than zero.In a world obsessed with high-intensity workouts and 30-day challenges, we often underestimate the power of small, consistent habits. And walking for just 2 minutes after a meal might be one of the most underrated health hacks out there. It doesn’t feel like much. It might even feel silly at first. But over time, it adds up to lower blood sugar, better heart health, more energy, and possibly even weight loss. So here’s your reminder: the next time you eat, don’t just sit there. Walk a little. Let your body do its thing."

Because the measles virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after someone infected leaves the area, these times include the estimated period when the individual was at the location and two hours after:\n\nApril 6, 5:45-10 p.m. — Seattle-Tacoma International Airport: Gate S10 in S Concourse, international arrivals, baggage claim Carousel 20 and Gina Marie Hall (southernmost exit near international airlines)\n\nApril 6, 8:45 p.m. until April 7, 7 a.m. — Comfort Suites Tukwila Airport, 7200 Fun Center Way\n\nApril 7, 4:45-7:30 a.m. — Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Gate S1 in S Concourse\n\nThe person was likely exposed to measles while traveling abroad, according to public health officials.\n\nThe measles vaccine is highly effective. Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR, provide about 97% protection against getting infected during a lifetime.\n\nAdvertising\n\nMost people have immunity to measles through vaccination, so the risk to the general public is low, according to Public Health. However, Public Health recommends anyone who was in the locations of potential exposure to measles around the times listed should:\n\nFind out if you have been vaccinated for measles or have had measles previously. Make sure you are up-to-date with the recommended number of measles vaccinations.\n\nCall a health care provider promptly if you develop an illness with fever or an unexplained rash. To avoid possibly spreading measles to others, do not go to a clinic or hospital without calling first to tell them you want to be checked for measles after an exposure. It is also important to limit contact with others, especially those without known immunity.\n\nIf you were at the locations at the times listed above and are not immune to measles, the most likely time you would become sick would be between April 13 and April 29. People who are immunocompromised may take longer to experience symptoms.\n\nSpread of measles can occur before people know they have it and before any rash appears.\n\nMeasles cases are rising in the U.S. There have been more measles cases in the country during the first three months of 2025 than in all of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

The child confirmed to have measles on April 7 has since fully recovered. Both recently returned from international travel.\n\n“As expected, on April 16, the test result confirmed measles infection,” said DOH in a news release. “Because of the duration between symptom onset and test specimen collection, an antibody test was performed which takes longer to process.”\n\n>> RELATED: Measles cases climb to 800 in 25 states, CDC says\n\nDOH said it has already investigated others who may have been exposed, based on this being a presumed case of measles. The adult is no longer contagious.\n\nThrough contact-tracing efforts, health officials have also identified dozens of individuals exposed to one or both cases at various Oahu locations, and asked 10, which had not been vaccinated or shown immunity against measles, to isolate at home.\n\nDon't miss out on what's happening!

The virus can remain in the air up to two hours after an infected person has left the room.\n\n“Vaccination is the best way to protect loved ones and prevent an outbreak,” said DOH. “If you or your ohana have not been vaccinated or otherwise have immunity against measles, please talk with your healthcare provider about getting a dose of the (measles, mumps, rubella) MMR vaccine.”"

            "content": "The rise in antibacterial resistance to common antibiotics has led to the growth of drug-resistant forms of gonorrhea, sometimes referred to as “super gonorrhea.” At the moment, just a handful of antibiotics stop the bacteria replicating.\n\nHealth experts have worried for some time what might happen if a new form of gonorrhea develops that doesn’t respond to our current drugs. Therefore, welcome relief greeted the information of a potential new medication to treat the bug.\n\nMedical journal The Lancet was the first to publish the news. It says the drug, gepotidacin, has proved effective in stage 3 trials.\n\nHow about we take this to the next level? Subscribe to our newsletter for a refreshing cocktail (or mocktail) of LGBTQ+ entertainment and pop culture, served up with a side of eye-candy.\n\nPharma giant GSK sells the drug under the brand name Blujepa. The medication received FDA approval in late March for the treatment of UTIs in women and girls over the age of 12, following its success in earlier trials.\n\nThis latest study highlights its use to specifically target gonorrhea. The company will now seek FDA approval to market Blujepa to treat men and women. If approved, it will be the first new antibiotic to tackle the gonorrhea in over 30 years.\n\nThe rise in gonorrhea\n\nGonorrhea rates hit a low in 2009 but rose steadily over the next dozen years. They have fallen since 2021, but it remains the second most common STI after chlamydia, according to the CDC.\n\nGonorrhea disproportionately impacts gay men. The introduction of PrEP a dozen years ago likely played a part in the increase in STI rates among queer guys. The adoption of DoxyPEP is believed to have helped bring down those rates slightly in the last couple of years.\n\nAt the moment, the CDC’s recommended gonorrhea treatment is a 500 mg injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone. For many, another of the benefits of Blujepa is that it comes in the form of oral pill. That means no more jabs.\n\nAmong the study of 600 people, Blujepa was 92% effective, compared to 91% for the currently recommended drugs. It was also effective against strains of gonorrhea resistant to current forms of treatment.\n\nStuart Ray, a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told The Hill, “In general, it’s very exciting to see a late-stage trial for a new antimicrobial for a thorny problem like gonorrhea. I think it’s very exciting to see data and progression of an agent this far down the path.”\n\nSign up for the Queerty newsletter to stay on top of the hottest stories in LGBTQ+ entertainment, politics, and culture."

            "content": "Poll Have you made any changes to your alcohol consumption for health reasons? No, I drink the same Yes, I drink less\n\nWalk like it matters\n\n\n\nEat half a plate of veggies every day\n\n\n\nLive with a purpose\n\n\n\nLimit alcohol\n\n\n\nCancer prevention isn’t about fear\n\n\n\nLet’s face it: when you hear the word cancer, it instantly sends a shiver down your spine. It’s one of those scary health topics no one really wants to think about, but deep down, we all wonder, “Am I doing enough to protect myself?” You don’t need to flip your life upside down or live in a bubble to reduce your cancer risk. There are small, super doable things you can start doing today that actually make a big difference over time.Recently, a cancer doctor Dr Amy Morris, who herself is a cancer survivor shared 4 essential things one must do in order to stay cancer free. In a video, shared on her Instagram account, Dr Morris says, \"As a cancer thriver, you’ve already done so much to get rid of cancer. Chemo, Surgery, Radiation. But now that all of that is done, you are likely wondering how do you STAY cancer free?\"Dr Morris talks about habits that are easy, natural, and can even make you feel happier, more energetic, and just... better. These four daily habits may sound basic, but together, they pack a punch when it comes to long-term protection.Walking. Sounds almost too simple, right? But regular walking—like even 30 minutes a day, can dramatically reduce your risk for certain cancers, especially breast, colon, and endometrial cancers.Walking helps maintain a healthy weight. Fat cells don’t just sit there; they produce hormones and inflammation that can fuel cancer. It improves digestion, meaning things move along faster in your gut (hello, reduced colon cancer risk). It boosts your immune system, which is your body's personal security guard against rogue cancer cells. You don’t have to power walk or wear fancy shoes. Just sneak it in: take phone calls while walking, park a bit further, or stroll after dinner. And yes, 10-minute walks three times a day are just as good as one long walk. It's the movement that matters!We’ve all heard \"eat your vegetables\" since kindergarten—but this simple advice may be one of your strongest cancer-fighting tools. Why half a plate? Because when veggies take up that much space, they naturally crowd out the less healthy stuff—like refined carbs and fatty meats. More color, less cancer risk.Cruciferous veggies (like broccoli, cabbage) are loaded with sulforaphane—a natural compound shown to fight cancer cells. Leafy greens are packed with antioxidants and folate, which help repair damaged cells. Fiber in vegetables keeps your gut happy and reduces the risk of colon cancer. Add spinach or grated carrots to your dal or roti dough. Top toast with avocado or cucumber. Toss whatever’s in the fridge into a stir-fry—no recipe needed. And no, it doesn’t have to be expensive. Even humble okra, pumpkin, or bottle gourd have their own protective superpowers.This one might sound a little too much to follow, but it’s legit: people who feel like they have a sense of purpose—something meaningful that gets them out of bed—tend to have lower inflammation, stronger immune function, and better long-term health. Living with purpose doesn’t mean you need to start a foundation or move to the mountains. It can be as simple as volunteering once a month, spending time with people who matter, growing a garden, creating something—art, music, a little blog or just waking up with an intention beyond the to-do list. When your life feels meaningful, your stress levels go down—and that’s huge, because chronic stress can weaken your immune system, mess with hormones, and even encourage cell mutations.Alcohol—even in small amounts—can increase the risk of several cancers, including breast, liver, mouth, and esophageal. Why? Alcohol turns into acetaldehyde in the body, a toxic chemical that can damage DNA and stop cells from repairing themselves. That’s literally the start of cancer.Not ready to quit? Have alcohol-free weekdays. Switch to smaller glasses. Sip slowly and space out drinks with water. Even cutting down a little can reduce your risk. It’s not about perfection—it’s about progress.It’s about empowerment. These daily choices won’t just reduce your cancer risk—they’ll improve your quality of life right now. More energy. Better sleep. Stronger immunity. Sharper mood. And the best part? These aren’t fads or expensive supplements. They’re simple, sustainable habits that work with your lifestyle—not against it.So take a walk. Eat your veggies. Follow your joy. Skip that second drink. Your everyday choices matter more than you think."

            "content": "Montana public health officials have identified five cases of measles in Gallatin County, the first confirmed instances of the infectious disease in the state since 1990.\n\nIn a Thursday evening press release, the state Department of Public Health and Human Services said the individuals — children and adults — are isolating at home in Gallatin County. All are unvaccinated or their vaccine status is not known, the release said.\n\nCounty health officials are working to establish who else may have been exposed to the disease in recent days.\n\n“The [Gallatin City County Health Department] continues to assess any potential exposures while the individuals were contagious and are contacting the people who may have been exposed. People potentially exposed are being provided with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for,” the state press release said.\n\nOn its website, Gallatin County health officials listed two locations where members of the public could have been exposed to measles.\n\nInterwest Tire on Jackrabbit Lane in Belgrade on Monday, April 14, between 12 p.m. and 4 p.m.\n\nNorth Coast Electric in Bozeman on Shedhorn Drive on Friday, April 11, between 7:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.\n\nThe announcement makes Montana one of 26 nationwide jurisdictions with measles cases, according to the most recent information from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of April 10, the federal agency had confirmed 712 cases.\n\nMontana officials said the infected people were exposed to the disease while traveling out of state, but did not say where.\n\nThe vast majority of nationwide cases, 97%, have affected people who are not vaccinated against measles, according to the CDC. About 70% of cases have occurred among those 19 years old and younger. Two children have died from the disease during the ongoing outbreak. A third death is under investigation.\n\nIn its Thursday press release, the state health department said that people “without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.”\n\nThe measles virus has an average incubation period of 14 days. Infectious particles can hang in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after someone leaves the area. A person carrying the virus can spread it to others days before they begin showing symptoms.\n\nState officials described early measles symptoms as including “fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth, and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure.” Infants under 12 months of age, who are typically not recommended to get either of the two-dose MMR vaccine series, are particularly at risk of infection.\n\nSome of the long-term health consequences from measles can include brain swelling, seizures, hearing loss, pneumonia, miscarriage and death.\n\nThe state health department said that a high level of vaccination at the community level helps protect infants and others who cannot be vaccinated from disease. The release did not state Gallatin County’s vaccination rate against measles.\n\n“While it is unfortunate to have cases of measles after 35 years of disease inactivity in Montana, we have been working diligently with our local partners to prepare,” said Dr. Maggie Cook-Shimanek, the state health department’s public health physician, in the Thursday announcement. “We are confident that our public health and clinical partners will work together and address this situation as quickly as possible. It is important for everyone to know their vaccination status and to visit with their health department or health care provider if they are unsure.”\n\nMontana legislation backed by Republican lawmakers in 2021 stripped a requirement from state law that required state officials to collect aggregated vaccination and exemption data from school districts and child care centers, creating a statewide information void about local vaccination rates.\n\nA bill to reverse that decision, House Bill 364, has stalled in the state Legislature."

Many popular tourist destinations in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico, are also affected.\n\nTravelers returning from dengue-endemic areas should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites for three weeks. If dengue symptoms develop within two weeks of return, travelers should seek medical evaluation.\n\nOther countries are reporting increased dengue cases, including Fiji, French Polynesia, Tonga, the Republic of the Philippines, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.\n\nTravelers should review up-to-date country-specific travel information for guidance on dengue risk and prevention measures at least four to six weeks before traveling.\n\nClick here for more information."

            "content": "Researchers at Mass General Brigham found that by December 2023, over one-third of all new prescriptions for type 2 diabetes were for GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutide or tirzepatide.\n\nNew research shows a major shift in how weight loss and type 2 diabetes are managed, with newer drugs like tirzepatide rapidly replacing older medications such as metformin and insulin. Between 2021 and 2023, use of GLP-1RA-based medications surged, especially tirzepatide, highlighting evolving prescribing patterns and the growing focus on obesity treatment.\n\nWhen it comes to managing weight loss and type 2 diabetes, it’s out with the old and in with the new. A study from Mass General Brigham analyzing insurance claims from nearly 2 million people between 2021 and 2023 highlights a major shift in the use of glucose- and weight-related medications.\n\nThe data show a sharp rise in the use of newly approved drugs, especially tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss, while older treatments like metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin have seen a decline.\n\nThe findings, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, reflect a rapidly evolving approach to managing type 2 diabetes and obesity.\n\n“Taken together, these findings highlight the rapidly shifting landscape of prescribing patterns for glucose-lowering and weight-lowering medications,” said lead author John W. Ostrominski, MD, of the Cardiovascular Division, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Hypertension, and Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. “These changing trends likely reflect the combination of new evidence, increased awareness and prioritization of obesity treatment, and changing guidance for how to help patients manage these conditions.”\n\nRise of GLP-1RA-Based Medications\n\nThe study, which was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, examined claims data among people with commercial insurance. The researchers report that in January 2021, approximately half of the weight-lowering medications initiated by people without diabetes were GLP-1RA-based medications such as semaglutide and tirzepatide. By December 2023, this percentage increased to nearly 90%, with tirzepatide being the most commonly started (31%). Use of other weight loss medications, such as phentermine and liraglutide, declined.\n\nAmong people with type 2 diabetes, 13% started GLP-1RA-based medications in January 2021. That rate rose to 35% by December 2023. Metformin, the most commonly started glucose-lowering medication in January 2021 (30%), declined to 19% by December 2023.\n\nWhen the authors compared the immediate post-approval uptake of tirzepatide to other medications recently approved for type 2 diabetes or obesity, they found that the rise in tirzepatide’s use was steeper and more sustained.\n\nImplications for Healthcare Providers and Policymakers\n\n“We saw a sharp uptake of tirzepatide after regulatory approval—these kinds of trends are important for patients, clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to be aware of,” said Ostrominski. “The rapidly expanding uptake of tirzepatide and GLP-1RA underscores the need for clinicians to become more familiar with their use, for researchers to improve understanding of their long-term effects, and for health policy that promotes sustained access and affordability.”\n\nThe researchers note several limitations to the work, including that it is uncertain whether the findings from commercially insured U.S. adults are generalizable to other populations and countries.\n\n“Importantly, we don’t yet have long-term data from outcomes trials for tirzepatide as we do for GLP-1RA, but preliminary data are reassuring,” said Ostrominski. “In the future, data comparing the benefits of tirzepatide versus semaglutide for glycemic control, obesity management, and cardiovascular outcomes will help us have more informed conversations with patients about choosing the medication that’s right for them.”\n\nReference: “Trends in Utilization of Glucose- and Weight-Lowering Medications After Tirzepatide Approval in the United States” by John W.

Credit: University of Rochester Medical Center\n\nNew research suggests that calming the brain's immune cells might prevent or lessen the damaging inflammation seen in Alzheimer's disease. The study points to the key role of the hormone and neurotransmitter norepinephrine, and this new understanding could pave the way for more focused treatments that start earlier and are tailored to the needs of each person.\n\n\"Norepinephrine is a major signaling factor in the brain and affects almost every cell type. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, it has been shown to be anti-inflammatory,\" said Ania Majewska, Ph.D., with the University of Rochester Del Monte Institute for Neuroscience, and senior author of the study.\n\n\"In this study, we describe how enhancing norepinephrine's action on microglia can mitigate early inflammatory changes and neuronal injury in Alzheimer's models.\"\n\nThe work is published in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.\n\nBrain chemicals and immune cells\n\nThe research, which was conducted in mice, included teams from two labs, combining research programs studying the complex role of the brain's immune system and the role of inflammation in Alzheimer's. Led by Linh Le, Ph.D., a graduate student in both labs, the researchers focused on norepinephrine, a chemical in the brain that helps control inflammation. In our brains, immune cells called microglia usually help keep things in balance. Microglia have a receptor called β2AR, which acts like a switch and directs the cells to respond to norepinephrine and calm down inflammation.\n\nIn Alzheimer's disease and as we age, this calming switch becomes less active, especially in areas of the brain where harmful protein clumps called amyloid plaques build up. As these plaques form, the nearby microglia lose more of their β2AR receptors, making it harder for them to fight inflammation.\n\nWhen scientists removed or blocked the receptor, the brain's damage worsened: more plaques, increased inflammation, and more harm to brain cells. On the other hand, when they stimulated or \"turned up\" the receptor, the harmful effects were reduced. Interestingly, the results appeared to depend on factors like the animal's sex and how early the treatment started.\n\nNew targets for future treatment\n\nTraditionally, Alzheimer's has been seen as a problem of damaged brain cells due to plaque buildup. This study shows that a loss of norepinephrine's calming effect on microglia might be a key factor that makes the disease worse, even before large amounts of nerve cell damage occur. The findings also suggest that problems with the β2AR receptor could start very early in the disease process, meaning that future treatments might be more effective if started sooner rather than later.\n\nSince activating the β2AR receptor in microglia reduced plaque buildup and inflammation, future drugs might be designed to target this specific receptor. By helping microglia maintain an anti-inflammatory response, these treatments could slow down or change the course of the disease. The research also hints that such treatments might need to be customized for each patient. This is because the effects can vary based on factors like biological sex and the disease's stage.\n\nAdditional co-authors include Alexis Feidler, Lia Calcines Rodriguez, MacKenna Cealie, Elizabeth Plunk, Herman Li, Kallam Kara-Pabani, Cassandra Lamantia, and Kerry O'Banion with the Del Monte Institute for Neuroscience.\n\nMore information: L.H.D.

            "description": "Two new studies found stem-cell treatments for Parkinson's were safe and decreased symptoms, but bigger trials are still needed.",
            "content": "Grabbing a coffee cup seems easy. But you need to be able to move your hand, stretch it out, and keep it steady.\n\nThese movements are difficult for people with Parkinson’s disease. The disorder eats away at brain cells—called dopamine neurons—that control movement and emotion. Symptoms begin with tremors. Then muscles lock up. Eventually, the disease makes walking and sleeping difficult. Thinking gets harder, and as neurons die, people lose their concentration and memory.\n\nMedications can keep some symptoms at bay, but eventually, their effects wear off. For nearly half a century, scientists have been exploring an alternative solution: Replacing dying dopamine neurons with new ones.\n\nThis month, two studies of nearly two dozen people with Parkinson’s showed the strategy is safe. A single transplant boosted dopamine levels for 18 months without notable side effects. Patients had fewer motor symptoms even when they stopped taking their regular medications.\n\nThe work stands out because instead of being tailored to each patient, the cells were ready-made. The teams grew new dopamine neurons from donors in the lab. These cells can multiply easily in petri dishes, forming a large supply of replacement cells for patients.\n\nMalin Parmar at Lund University, who was not involved in the study, told Nature the results are “a big leap in the field.”\n\nA Deteriorating Brain\n\nParkinson’s is the world’s second most common neurodegenerative disease, with up to 90,000 new cases a year in the US. Michael J. Fox, who played Marty McFly in Back to the Future and launched a foundation to find a Parkinson’s cure, is perhaps the most famous person living with the disease.\n\nIn Parkinson’s, neurons in the middle of the brain gradually die. Called the substantia nigra, the region is intricately connected with surrounding areas and is critical for movement and emotions. Although the entire area eventually deteriorates, neurons that pump out dopamine—a chemical that fine-tunes neural networks and functions—are first to go. This means the brain gradually loses dopamine as the disease progresses.\n\nThere are treatments but no cures.\n\nOne common medication, Levodopa, tackles symptoms. Neurons slurp up the drug and transform it into dopamine. But as brain cells gradually die, the medication becomes less effective. Levodopa also has side effects. Because midbrain wiring influences both addictive behaviors and motor control, flooding it with dopamine can change how people act, like increasing the risk of gambling addiction and other obsessive behaviors. Long-term use can also trigger random movements of the face, arms, and legs—a symptom called dyskinesia.\n\nBrain implants that bridge broken connections in the midbrain are another treatment. Deep brain stimulation, for example, mimics natural brain signals to ease motor symptoms. Some implants are already approved for use, but they require surgery and monitoring and aren’t widely accessible.\n\nRather than patching a broken circuit with a temporary fix, what if we could replace broken dopamine neurons with fresh ones?\n\nStem-Cell Marathon\n\nStem cells offer a solution. These special cells can grow into any other type of cell under the right conditions, making them the perfect replacement for dying neurons.\n\nBack in the 1980s, one team transplanted brain tissue rich in dopamine neurons into people with Parkinson’s. These patients experienced a boost of dopamine and improved motor control for years after the surgery. But the source was highly controversial: fetal brain tissue.\n\nAlthough a “first proof-of-concept for cell transplantation therapy,” the trial raised “ethical concerns,” according to Hideyuki Okano at the Keio University Regenerative Medicine Research Center in Japan, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nAs an alternative, scientists have learned to create stem cells in the lab. One method produces stem cell lines that can grow almost forever under the right conditions. In another, scientists chemically transform adult cells, often taken from the skin, into a stem-cell-like state. These are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Five years ago, a team converted iPSCs into dopamine neurons and transplanted them into a patient, improving symptoms for up to two years."

Most of the rabbits at the property have died. The few that remain are now under strict quarantine.\n\nThe rabbits were kept outdoors, and officials believe the rabbits could have come into contact with wild ones carrying the virus. While Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus has not yet been found in wild rabbits in western Oregon, the virus is known to be present in wild populations in central and eastern Oregon.\n\nRabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus is highly contagious among rabbits but poses no risk to humans or other animals.\n\nThe virus spreads through direct contact with infected rabbits or contaminated fur, meat, equipment or surfaces. Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, loss of coordination, lethargy and bloody discharge from the nose — but in many cases, death comes before any visible signs.\n\nState officials are advising rabbit owners to quarantine any new rabbits for 30 days, thoroughly disinfect equipment and clothing after handling rabbits, and keep pet rabbits indoors to prevent exposure to potentially infected environments. Rabbit owners can also contact their veterinarian for more information on preventing the virus.\n\nOfficials are also asking the public to help track the viral disease by reporting any sudden rabbit deaths — whether domestic, feral or wild.\n\nThose who suspect cases of the virus in pet rabbits or notice sudden rabbit deaths in their area can call the Oregon Department of Agriculture at 503-986-4711.

            "content": "An American content creator who relocated to Portugal was surprised to discover several simple lifestyle “quirks” that helped her lose 20 pounds.\n\nWhen Richa Prasad, 39, moved from Seattle to Portugal two years ago, she found that her consumption habits clashed with local traditions.\n\n“I’d walk around with a drink in hand, sometimes even having my lunch on the go. I felt it was productive to knock out two tasks at the same time, but I noticed people kept giving me weird looks. Turns out nobody in Europe walks and eats,” she recently explained in a video posted to YouTube.\n\nPrasad noted that even on workdays in Europe, meals are seated affairs that last one to three hours — not because people are eating more, but because they’re pacing themselves through conversation. She learned that the same ethos applies to drinking.\n\n3 Content creator Richa Prasad believes the US is a nation of extremes that could benefit from a less severe approach to wellness. Ekaterina Pokrovsky – stock.adobe.com\n\n“In Seattle, nights out meant slamming drinks. In Europe, people nurse their drinks for hours,” she said.\n\nThis slow, steady, savor mindset extends beyond eating and drinking and into workflow as well.\n\n“Whenever I meet new people in Europe, nobody ever asks me, ‘What do you do?’ In the US, that’s the first thing people want to know…In Europe, work is just one part of life, like going to a cafe. There’s no urgency, no drama,” she shared.\n\nPrasad believes the US is a nation of extremes that could benefit in mind, body and spirit from a less severe approach to wellness.\n\n“It’s shifting our mindset from dramatic high-stakes sprints to steady, consistent marches, meaning you commit to no longer pendulum swinging between being on a diet or completely off the rails,” she said. “Meal prepping with military precision or bingeing on takeout when life gets busy, then doing hardcore workouts as punishment for the binge.”\n\nPrasad said that Europeans tend to eschew diets for consistency.\n\n“They just exist in a steady rhythm, and that’s the shift that changed everything for me.”\n\nIn accordance with that steady rhythm, she noticed that Europeans who lose weight do so without measures like restrictive dieting, extreme fasting or keto eating.\n\nPrasad maintained that most Europeans eat according to the principle of pleasure.\n\n3 Prasad moved from Seattle to Portugal two years ago, she found that her consumption habits clashed with local traditions. Youtube\n\n“Europeans eat real butter, full-fat cheese and croissants without guilt. They don’t eat with a restrictive mentality where, even as you’re digging into that croissant, every bite is taken with guilt, because guess what happens when you eat with guilt: you don’t enjoy it, you’re never satisfied.”\n\nDoes this mean we should all abandon ourselves to rich eating and a daily dose of butter and bread?\n\n“Yes and no,” she confessed. “Because if you love food, you should eat real food that nourishes your body.”\n\nUltraprocessed foods (UPFs) make up about 60% of the US diet compared to just 14% of European diets.\n\nUPFs have been linked to a host of adverse health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. A 2024 study suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of premature death.\n\nPrasad recommended we emulate our European counterparts and aim to reduce our junk food intake from 60% to 14%.\n\n“Most junk and sweets we eat tend to be out of cravings, not hunger,” she said. “So if we reduce the number of times we give in to cravings, the amount of junk we eat will all go down.”\n\nA 2023 study found American adults average four meals a day — with one consisting entirely of junk food.\n\nIn addition to reducing or eliminating junk food, Prasad suggested cutting back on snacking, as most Europeans observe meal times and refrain from grazing in between.\n\n“By and large, they don’t snack. They tend to eat at set meal times and engage in mini-intermittent fasting, lasting three to four hours between meals,” she revealed. “This, in turn, reduces the chances of giving in to cravings because you’re no longer making a decision every time an urge to eat strikes you.”\n\nPrasad said these set meals should prioritize the inclusion of “one palm-sized portion of lean protein, one fistful of vegetables and one cup of water first. After that, you can eat whatever you want without guilt.”\n\n3 Prasad suggests setting a timer to ensure your meal lasts at least 20 minutes and is free from distractions, such as screen time. Davide Angelini – stock.adobe.com\n\nShe encouraged setting a timer to ensure your meal lasts at least 20 minutes and is free from distractions, such as screen time.\n\nA 2024 study found that people who ate while distracted reported less enjoyment and satisfaction, a greater desire for further gratification and increased snacking afterward. Researchers call this phenomenon “hedonic compensation” — making up for the loss of pleasure by seeking extra gratification elsewhere.\n\nIn addition to mindful eating practices, Prasad wants Americans to incorporate more physical activity into their daily lives, but to avoid intense, hunger-spiking exercise that’s more about punishment than pleasure.\n\n“Instead of parking close to your building entrance, park far away and walk. Instead of taking the elevator, take the stairs,” she urged. “Drive to a park close to you and go for a walk as many times a week as you can.”\n\nShe also suggests experimenting with different sports until you find one you really enjoy — and then optimizing your engagement for enjoyment, not improvement."

(CREDIT: Shutterstock)\n\nIn the fight against cancer, researchers continue to look for everyday habits that might make a difference. A recent global study has shed new light on something many people do daily—drink coffee or tea. This study explored whether these popular beverages could lower the risk of head and neck cancer, a group of diseases that includes cancers of the mouth, throat, and voice box.\n\nThe results may give hope to millions of coffee and tea drinkers worldwide. The findings suggest that drinking coffee, both caffeinated and decaffeinated, and even tea in certain amounts, may be linked to lower chances of developing certain types of head and neck cancer.\n\nA Global Look at a Growing Cancer Concern\n\nHead and neck cancers are now the seventh most common type of cancer around the world. These cancers are becoming more frequent, especially in low- and middle-income countries. As more people are affected, scientists are working harder to understand how lifestyle choices might influence cancer risks.\n\nNew research suggests that daily coffee consumption may help lower the risk of head and neck cancers. (CREDIT: Science Photo Library)\n\nOver the years, studies on coffee and tea’s impact on these cancers have had mixed results. Some showed promise, while others found no clear link. To get a better picture, researchers from around the world came together to reanalyze a large amount of data. The team, led by the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, reviewed 14 different studies gathered by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) consortium.\n\nThis group looked at information from nearly 25,000 people. Of these, 9,548 had head and neck cancer, and 15,783 did not. Participants answered detailed questions about how much coffee and tea they drank over time. This included whether the coffee was regular or decaffeinated and how often they consumed it.\n\nWhat the Study Revealed About Coffee\n\nThe results showed a clear trend: people who drank more than four cups of caffeinated coffee per day had lower odds of getting head and neck cancer. Specifically, these individuals had: 17% lower odds of developing any type of head and neck cancer, 30% lower odds of developing cancer of the mouth, and 22% lower odds of developing throat cancer.\n\nEven more striking, those who drank three to four cups daily had a 41% lower risk of developing hypopharyngeal cancer. This is a rare but serious type of cancer that starts at the bottom part of the throat, near the voice box.\n\nEven decaffeinated coffee seemed to offer benefits. People who drank decaf had 25% lower odds of getting oral cavity cancer. This finding is important because it suggests that something other than caffeine—possibly antioxidants or other plant-based compounds in coffee—might be helping protect cells.\n\nTea's Role in Cancer Risk\n\nTea also showed some promise, especially when it came to hypopharyngeal cancer. People who drank tea had 29% lower odds of getting this type of cancer. Those who drank one cup or less per day had:\n\n9% lower risk of head and neck cancer overall\n\n27% lower risk of hypopharyngeal cancer\n\nStudy-specific odds ratios for >4 cups of caffeinated coffee daily versus non–coffee drinkers for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers. (CREDIT: American Cancer Society)\n\nHowever, the relationship between tea and cancer risk wasn’t all positive. Drinking more than one cup of tea daily was linked with a 38% higher chance of developing laryngeal cancer, which affects the voice box.\n\nThis surprising result shows that the effects of tea might vary depending on how much is consumed and which part of the head or neck is involved.\n\nWhat These Findings Mean\n\n“While there has been prior research on coffee and tea consumption and reduced risk of cancer, this study highlighted their varying effects with different sub-sites of head and neck cancer, including the observation that even decaffeinated coffee had some positive impact,” said Yuan-Chin Amy Lee, the study’s senior author.\n\nLee, an adjunct associate professor in public health, pointed out that coffee and tea habits can be complex. People drink them in many different ways—some with milk or sugar, some plain, and in different amounts.\n\nThese habits might influence how coffee or tea affects the body. “These findings support the need for more data and further studies around the impact that coffee and tea can have on reducing cancer risk,” Lee added.\n\nThis study doesn't prove that coffee or tea prevents cancer. But it does suggest that these beverages could play a role in lowering the risk for some people. The research also helps show how different types of head and neck cancer may respond differently to substances found in these drinks.\n\nTakeaways for Everyday Life\n\nIf you're someone who drinks coffee or tea, this study offers some good news. While more research is needed, moderate coffee drinking could be linked with lower chances of developing certain cancers of the head and neck. Even decaf coffee might help.\n\nCharacteristics of head and neck cancer cases and controls of select INHANCE consortium studies. (CREDIT: American Cancer Society)\n\nWhen it comes to tea, a cup a day might help protect against some cancers, but more than that could raise the risk for others. This suggests a careful balance is needed. The kind of tea, how it’s made, and what’s added to it could all play a role in how it affects your health.\n\nAs always, no single food or drink can fully protect you from cancer. But understanding how common habits influence health is a key part of cancer prevention. These new findings may encourage more people to look at how everyday choices—like what you drink—could add up over time to support better health.\n\nNote: The article above provided above by The Brighter Side of News."

            "content": "A microscope image of the tissue around the rete ovarii, an organ that may play an important role in female fertility.\n\nAn unsung appendage in the female body, which has long been considered useless, may actually be essential for ovary development and fertility, a new mouse study finds.\n\nThis structure, called the rete ovarii, was first discovered in humans over a century ago, but until now, it was considered a so-called vestigial structure — not crucial in adult female anatomy, but a leftover from fetal development. Vestigial anatomical structures, or \"vestiges,\" are generally thought to have once had a crucial function that was later lost in the course of human evolution.\n\nBut according to a new study, published March 19 in the journal eLife , the rete ovarii (RO) may actually play an important role in ovarian function, and therefore, fertility. The work also showed that the structure has three distinct regions and may respond to hormonal signals.\n\n\"The female reproductive tract is often thought to consist of the vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, oviduct, and ovaries,\" the researchers wrote in their paper. \"We suggest that the RO be added to this list and investigated as an additional component of female reproductive function.\"\n\nAlthough their study is based in mice, the researchers think it likely applies to people because the structure is also present in a number of other mammal species, including cows, cats, sheep, pigs, dogs and monkeys. Additionally, humans and mice share similar early sex-organ development pathways, so the scientists assume that the structure and its developmental cues might be similar in humans.\n\nRelated: 10 body parts that are useless in humans (or maybe not)\n\nThe RO is a horseshoe-shaped network of tubes nestled beneath the ovary, at the site where blood vessels and nerves enter the organ. However, despite the structure being highly conserved among mammals, when it was first found in humans in 1870, scientists deemed it to have no use .\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Some of their experiments used living mice, so that the researchers could study how the RO develops in the womb. Other tissues analyzed in the study were collected from euthanized animals after death.\n\nThe study found that the RO contains three distinct regions that mature during fetal development and then are maintained in adulthood. These regions include the intraovarian rete (IOR), located within the ovary itself; the extraovarian rete (EOR), made of convoluted tubules that join up into a bulb at one end ; and the connecting rete (CR), a transitional zone between the IOR and EOR.\n\nUsing mass spectrometry — a technique used to identify and quantify molecules — the researchers discovered that, at birth, the EOR contains thousands of proteins within its tubes that its own cells appear to produce. One protein was insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), may be involved in ovary function. The protein may modulate the availability and activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which are structurally similar to insulin and important for the development of the follicles that carry immature eggs and hormones in the ovary.\n\nIn other experiments, the researchers watched fluorescent dye move through the EOR, revealing that fluid within the EOR is propelled toward the ovary. This further suggests that the RO has a role in ovarian function.\n\nIn another analysis, they found that the cells of the RO expressed, or switched on, genes that code for a variety of hormone receptors, including receptors for the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones play important roles in female reproduction and health, helping to orchestrate the menstrual cycle, among other jobs.\n\n\"It appears that the rete ovarii may have a role in ovarian homeostasis - maintaining the ovaries and their environment,\" Taylor suggested. \"Similarly they appear to be able to detect fluid movement in and around the ovaries and their microenvironment. Finally and most interestingly is the potential endocrine [hormonal] role that the rete ovarii may have.\"\n\nThe researchers behind the study suggest that the EOR may \"act as an antenna\" to receive signals from the rest of the body, both via hormones and nerves, and then send that information on to the ovary via the proteins it secretes and transports.\n\n\"There's still so much we can't even begin to comprehend about female anatomy,\" study lead author Dilara Anbarci , a developmental biologist at the University of Michigan, told Science News . \"I hope this encourages more investigation in reevaluating what we don't already know about the ovary.\"\n\nThe researchers hope to further investigate the function and component structures of the rete ovarii, looking into how the EOR actually responds to hormones and whether the proteins it secretes change in response to changes in the body.\n\nThis research challenges the traditional view of the RO being considered redundant, proposing instead that it has a secret wealth of functions. Figuring out how the rete ovarii works could one day help scientists better understand and treat conditions of the female reproductive system.\n\n\"The endocrine system plays a key role in gynaecological health,\" Taylor said. \"A greater understanding of any structures in this region has the potential to open up new therapeutic avenues and opportunities in treating various conditions.\""

            "description": "Young women are binge drinking more often than young men, but drinking is down overall",
            "content": "Young Americans aren't drinking as much alcohol as previous generations, says Dr. Bryant Shuey, a physician at the University of Pittsburgh, but he's noticed a concerning trend among those who do indulge. Shuey and other researchers say that in a reversal of past trends, women 18 to 25 are now binge drinking more often than men the same age, per ABC News . In a research letter published in the journal JAMA , Shuey and his colleagues say that from 2017 to 2019, 36.4% of young women reported binge drinking in the previous month, versus 37.7% of young men. From 2021 to 2023, however, the figures were 31.6% of women versus 29.9% of men in the age group.\n\nThe researchers used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, with binge drinking defined as a man having five or more drinks in one sitting, and a woman having four or more. Among older age groups, men were still significantly more likely to report binge drinking. It's not clear whether the reversal of the gender gap among young people is the result of a faster decline in drinking among young men, researchers say. Shuey says the trend has \"big implications\" for health and that there should be greater awareness of the risks of alcohol abuse, per ABC. \"We need more education around the harms of alcohol use and how the same amount can pose greater health risks for women than men,\" he says.\n\n\"Given rising alcohol-related liver disease and mortality among females relative to males, clinicians should ensure that young adult female populations are being appropriately screened for binge and heavy drinking to mitigate downstream alcohol-related health impacts,\" researchers wrote in the letter. As for the overall decline in drinking among young people, addiction expert Johannes Thrul at Johns Hopkins' Bloomberg School of Public Health tells NPR that the culture is changing and drinking is no longer as commonly accepted as a \"normal part of development\" as it used to be. Another possible factor: During the pandemic, many young people missed out on a lot of socializing at the age when lifelong drinking patterns are often established. (More binge drinking stories.)"

            "description": "A growing body of evidence suggests artificial sweeteners may have many harms for health.",
            "content": "Artificial sweeteners are being added to a growing number of foods to reduce their sugar content while maintaining their appealing taste. But a growing body of research suggests these non-nutritive sweeteners may not always be a healthier and safer option. So what is our best option if we want to enjoy sweet-tasting foods without the harms of eating sugar?\n\nArtificial sweeteners were originally developed as chemicals to stimulate our sweet-taste sensing pathway. Like sugar molecules, these sweeteners act directly on our taste sensors in the mouth. They do this by sending a nerve signal to the body that a high-carbohydrate food source has been consumed – telling the body to break it down to use for energy.\n\nIn the case of sugar consumption, this also stimulates our dopaminergic system. This is the part of the brain responsible for motivation and reward, linked to sugar cravings. From an evolutionary perspective, this means we’re hardwired to seek out high-sugar food for a source of energy and to ensure our survival. However, excessive consumption of sugar is well known to lead to health problems, such as metabolic disruption which can cause obesity and diabetes.\n\nSimilarly, when artificial sweeteners, rather than sugar, cause this stimulation, there’s increasing evidence of similar metabolic imbalances. This happens despite the fact that artificial sweeteners do not seem to stimulate the dopamine system.\n\nIndeed, a study published earlier this year showed that within two hours of consuming sucralose (an amount equivalent to the sugar in two cans of soft drink), participants exhibited increased physiological hunger responses. The research measured blood flow to the hypothalamus, the region of our brain responsible for appetite control. They found that sucralose increased blood flow to this area of the brain.\n\nStudies have also shown that sweeteners can stimulate the same neurons as the appetite hormone, leptin. Over time, this could cause our hunger threshold to increase – meaning we need to eat more food to feel full. This suggests that consuming artificial sweeteners makes us more hungry, which could ultimately make us consume more calories.\n\nAnd it doesn’t stop with feeling hungrier. A large study, which was conducted over 20 years, found a link between sweetener consumption and greater accumulation of body fat. Interestingly, the study found that people who regularly consumed large amounts of sweeteners (equivalent to three or four cans of diet soda per day) had a nearly 70% greater incidence of obesity compared to those who consumed minimal amounts of artificial sweeteners (equivalent to half a can of diet soda per day).\n\nThe study also considered this response to be independent of the amount of calories the participants consumed each day. To verify this, they reviewed food questionnaires to assess self-reported dietary intake. While self-reported consumption can have discrepancies, the study also used a coding nutrition data system to verify dietary intake. The results indicate that artificial sweeteners may be making us more likely to form fat in our body – regardless of what we’re consuming alongside the artificial sweeteners.\n\nA study published earlier this month also found that daily consumption of artificially sweetened drinks positively correlated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes. But given these drinks contain a range of additives – including acidifiers, dyes, emulsifiers and sweeteners – it’s uncertain if this link can be entirely attributed to artificial sweeteners.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nSo is it time to give up sweeteners completely? Maybe not. There are many studies which add to the controversy by showing that short-term substitution of sugar with artificial sweeteners reduces body weight and body fat.\n\nNumerous studies have also shown that artificial sweetener consumption has no association with the development of diabetes or even with indicators of diabetes, such as fasting glucose or insulin levels. However, many of these studies were performed over relatively short time periods (up to 12 months) and only compared people consuming artificial sweeteners versus sugar. This makes it hugely confusing for all of us to know what we should do.\n\nTo address this, earlier this month, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), which advises the UK government on nutrition, released a position statement on the use of non-sugar sweeteners. This was in response to the World Health Organization, which suggested that sweeteners shouldn’t be used as a means of weight control due to their low-level association with risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe SACN similarly concluded that non-sugar sweetener intake be minimised, especially for children. But they also stated that intake of sugars in general needs to be reduced. This is really at the heart of the issue. Artificial sweeteners may have significant negative health impacts, but are they as bad for us as sugar? The overwhelming literature on the negatives of excess sugar consumption currently suggests no – but our understanding of artificial sweeteners is still not as extensive as that for sugar.\n\nWe need more research on artificial sweeteners to better understand their effects. Work is currently ongoing to collate a database of all clinical trials investigating sweetener use. This will allow us to better understand the sweetener research landscape and highlight areas where more work is needed.\n\nUntil then, what should we do if we have a sweet-tooth? Unfortunately, like everything with nutrition, it’s best to only consume artificial sweeteners in moderation.\n\nThere are no clear guidelines on the amounts of sweeteners we should or shouldn’t be consuming yet. But one of the guidelines from the recent SACN review is that the industry clearly label the amount of artificial sweeteners in food and drink. So hopefully it will be easier for us to make these choices in the future."

            "content": "Anti-vaccine activists with close ties to US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are falsely claiming that the measles public health crisis in Texas is caused by a “bioweapon” targeting the Mennonite community. These activists are now trying to sell their followers a range of pseudoscientific cures—some purportedly powered by artificial intelligence—that supposedly prevent customers from contracting measles.\n\nThe claims were made in a webinar posted online last week and hosted by Mikki Willis, an infamous conspiracy filmmaker best known for his Plandemic series of pseudo-documentaries. These helped supercharge Covid-19 disinformation online and were, Kennedy has said, funded in part by Children’s Health Defense (CHD), an anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded. Willis also created a video for Kennedy marking the announcement of his independent run for the presidency.\n\n“I’m not going to be careful by calling it a virus,” Willis said in the measles webinar. “I’m going to call it what it is, and that is a bioweapon, and my belief after interviewing these families is that this has been manipulated and targeted towards a community that is a threat because of their natural way of living.” (Measles is not a bioweapon. It is a viral infection that can be easily prevented by getting a vaccine.)\n\nThe webinar was hosted by Rebel Lion, the supplement company that Willis cofounded. On the website, and prominently featured under the webinar, Willis sells and recommends a “measles treatment and prevention protocol” full of supplements and tools on the site. On the webinar, Willis claimed the protocol will help parents “get prepped for, if God forbid this does get out, and their children get sick.” Together, purchasing the full protocol costs hundreds of dollars.\n\n“This is the standard radical anti-vaccine extremist playbook,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, tells WIRED. “You can see RFK Jr. has translated his anti-vaccine lies into political power. You can see others have converted it into economic power. And there’s some that just do it because it makes them feel good to be listened to, to be important, to be the center of a community. There’s always an ulterior motive.”\n\nThe community Willis refers to in the webinar is the Mennonite community in Seminole, a small city in west Texas, which has been the epicenter of the measles outbreak. Over 560 measles cases have been reported in Texas alone. To date, the deaths of two children have been linked to the measles outbreak, and another death is under investigation.\n\nWillis’ bogus claim about a bioweapon is part of a larger effort by the anti-vaccine community to undermine the threat posed by the infection. Many, instead, have claimed that the measles deaths were caused by other diseases or, in some cases, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine itself. These claims are not true and “there have been no deaths shown to be related to the MMR vaccine in healthy people,” according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America."

            "content": "Africa CDC and WHO have updated their joint Continental Response Plan for the mpox emergency as the disease continues to affect new areas. The revised strategy focuses on controlling outbreaks, while expanding vaccination coverage and transitioning toward a longer-term, sustainable response.\n\nMpox is a viral illness that spreads between people, mainly through close contact. It causes painful skin and mucosal lesions, often accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. The disease can be debilitating and disfiguring.\n\nHistorically a zoonotic disease transmitted from infected animals, mpox has increasingly shown a tendency to spread between people. In 2022, a variant of the virus, clade IIb, began spreading globally through sexual contact. Since late 2023, yet another viral strain, clade Ib, began spreading through sexual networks and within households and through close contact. This prompted Africa CDC to declare a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security and the WHO Director-General to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in August 2024.\n\nBy August 2024, the virus had begun spreading from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 4 neighbouring countries. Since then, 28 countries around the world have reported cases of mpox due to clade Ib. Outside Africa, cases remain largely travel-related. However, within Africa, in addition to transmission in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, local transmission has now been documented in additional countries including the Republic of the Congo, South Africa, South Sudan, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia.\n\nSince the declaration of the emergency, both regional and global support has increased, particularly for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the epicentre of the outbreak. The Africa CDC and WHO Joint Continental Mpox Plan has guided these efforts, focusing on ten key pillars: coordination, risk communication and community engagement, disease surveillance, laboratory capacity, clinical management, infection prevention and control, vaccination, research, logistics, and maintaining essential health services.\n\nVaccination efforts are underway, with more than 650 000 doses administered in 6 countries, 90% of which have been administered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Overall, over a million doses have been delivered to 10 countries, with efforts ongoing to secure additional vaccine supplies.\n\nDiagnostic testing capacity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has grown significantly, driven by the expansion of laboratory infrastructure - from 2 laboratories in late 2023 to 23 laboratories in 12 provinces today. With new, near-point-of-care tests currently being rolled out in the country, capacity is expected to increase even further.\n\nDespite this progress, major challenges remain. Ongoing conflict and insecurity in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the incidence of mpox remains high, as well as humanitarian aid cuts, continue to limit the public health response and restrict access to essential services. Across countries and partners, over US$ 220 million is needed to fill funding gaps for the mpox response.\n\nThe updated Continental Response Plan calls for intensified efforts to bring outbreaks under control, while also taking concrete actions to integrate mpox into routine health services.\n\nAlong with the Continental Response Plan for Africa, WHO has updated the global strategic plan to curb - and where feasible, to stop - human-to-human transmission of mpox. In the first two months of 2025, 60 countries reported mpox, with the majority of cases and deaths reported from the African continent. The joint Continental Response Plan is aligned with the global strategy."

            "content": "Nearly 400 Washingtonians have died from influenza since October, making the past year the state’s deadliest flu season in over a decade.\n\nExperts still expect several more weeks of flu activity, but the number of U.S. influenza deaths has already surpassed annual totals from each of the last five years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThat’s also true in Washington — where this year’s toll has topped the state’s total from its previous deadliest flu season, in 2017-18. That year, 296 people died from the flu; so far in the 2024-25 season, 388 people have died, including three children, according to the state Department of Health.\n\nThe surge of flu illness and deaths has created significant concern in hospitals and among public health teams this season, compared with other respiratory diseases. While COVID was much more mild over the winter, influenza charged through the state in multiple rounds, amid lagging vaccination rates.\n\nMost people who have died from the flu this season have been older adults or had underlying health conditions, the state health department said in its weekly flu report. More than 300 of the 388 deaths have been among those over 65.\n\nFlu deaths in Washington near 400 Almost 400 people in Washington, including three children, have died from the flu so far this season. This has become the state’s deadliest influenza season in 10 years.\n\nAdvertising\n\nNationwide, the CDC estimates 26,000 to 130,000 people died from the flu between October and early April, according to a preliminary calculation.\n\nThe number of deaths in King County is an undercount, “as many flu-related deaths, locally and nationally, are not captured by standard reporting,” Dr. Faisal Khan, director of Public Health – Seattle & King County, said in a Wednesday statement.\n\nThe seasonal respiratory virus has had an unusual past five years, taking a back seat for a while when SARS-CoV-2 emerged and dominated in circulation, and also required people to mask, distance and stay inside. During the 2020-21 season, there were no flu deaths in Washington.\n\nSince then, influenza has gradually ramped back up and become more deadly almost every year. Because people’s immune systems were shielded from exposure for so long, they’re now “more susceptible” to the virus, Khan said.\n\nIn Washington, flu season has been so forceful that at this point in the year, the state has counted more deaths from influenza than COVID, DOH said this week.\n\nKhan also pointed to specific strains circulating this year that could be contributing to the severity of the season.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAccording to DOH, the predominant circulating strains this season have been influenza A viruses, specifically H3N2 and H1N1 variants, which historically cause more severe illness and are more infectious than influenza B viruses. The H3N2 strain “tends to mutate frequently, making it harder for immune systems to recognize and respond effectively,” DOH said in a statement.\n\nAt the same time, the state is slightly less vaccinated against the flu this year than it has been since at least 2021. So far this season, about 30% of Washingtonians have gotten a flu shot, according to health department data. Last year, about 31.5% were immunized against the flu, and about 33.2% were the year before.\n\nAmong Washington children 6 months to 4 years old — typically the most-vaccinated age group after adults over 65 — flu vaccination rates fell 10 percentage points over the past four seasons.\n\nSo although last year saw a drop in flu deaths compared to the year prior, this season has so far nearly totaled both combined.\n\nThis year, the high death count follows a late-season second wave of infection that drove up flu hospitalization and case rates near the end of January and throughout February. Around that time, about 28% of flu samples from public health labs were returning positive, and patients with the flu accounted for about 7.5% of all emergency visits, according to DOH. Both COVID and RSV emergency visits made up less than 1%.\n\nAt the time, UW Medicine emergency physician Dr. Steve Mitchell worried about the high rate of flu hospitalizations — and what it might mean for coming deaths.\n\nAdvertising\n\n“Death is a lagging indicator,” Mitchell, who sees patients at Harborview Medical Center and UW Medical Center Montlake, said in an interview in February.\n\nDOH does not publicly share flu death numbers by county, instead clumping different regions together, and not all Washington county health departments regularly publish their own respiratory virus data.\n\nIn King County, 96 people have died from the flu so far this season, according to Public Health – Seattle & King County, which does make data dashboards for COVID, flu and RSV figures publicly available online.\n\nKhan said this has been the deadliest flu season in King County since influenza became a nationally notifiable condition in the U.S. Lab-confirmed flu deaths became a reportable condition to DOH during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.\n\nIn Snohomish County, 39 people have died, according to its health department. Spokane County has counted at least 45 flu deaths, according to its public health department’s respiratory illness data dashboard.\n\nIn the CDC’s most recent weekly flu surveillance update, the report called this the “first high severity season” since 2017-18, across all age groups.\n\nSponsored\n\nOther states are also seeing record-breaking flu seasons. In North Carolina, health officials last week said the state had counted more than 500 flu deaths, the most since tracking began in 2009.\n\nCalifornia has tallied more than 1,500 flu deaths since October, according to an early April report from the California Department of Public Heath.\n\nThe wave seems to have subsided, for now.\n\nSince March, flu activity throughout the country has quieted, with positive tests declining every week for more than a month, according to the CDC. Flu deaths have also slowed.\n\nIn Washington, positive flu tests had plunged to about 6.3% of total samples as of early April, DOH said in its most recent update. The department said it considers flu activity statewide to be low. And in King County, there have been fewer weekly flu deaths reported over the last month, though there are still one to two a week, according to county data.\n\nVaccination remains the best way to prevent serious illness, especially among older adults, babies and people with underlying health conditions who are at higher risk of flu complications, according to national and state public health experts. The CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine every year, with some rare exceptions.\n\nAdvertising\n\n“Staying up-to-date with vaccinations is something each of us can do to help protect infants, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions,” state health officer Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett said in a written statement.\n\nIt’s still “not too late” to get a flu shot, added King County’s public health director. Immunization “could mean the difference between being hospitalized or having mild illness at home,” Khan said.\n\nCorrection: A comment by Dr. Faisal Khan, director of Public Health – Seattle & King County, about undercounting the season’s flu death numbers may have implied he was speaking nationally. He was referring to King County."

            "content": "Key Takeaways A new study suggests that higher vitamin D levels may lead to lower rates of colon cancer.\n\nEating patterns like the Mediterranean diet tend to include higher levels of vitamin D.\n\nChat with your doctor to decide if vitamin D supplement is a good choice for you.\n\nColorectal cancer is one of the leading cancers worldwide, especially in countries that follow a Western lifestyle and diet. Worldwide, 1.2 million new colorectal cancer cases are diagnosed each year, making it the second most common cancer in men and the third most common in women.\n\nIn the U.S., colorectal cancer—sometimes called CRC—is the third most common cancer diagnosed in men and women, excluding skin cancers. The lifetime risk for developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 24 for men and 1 in 26 for women, depending on risk factors.\n\nScientists are always looking for ways to reduce the risk of diseases like colorectal cancer, which includes cancers of the colon and rectum. In a review of previously published studies, researchers focused on the relationship between vitamin D and colorectal cancer. They published the review in April 2025 in Nutrients. Let’s break down their findings.\n\nHow Was This Study Conducted?\n\nThis study was a review, meaning that the researchers assessed a variety of previous studies to look for overarching connections the results shared.\n\nResearchers searched scientific databases for studies on colorectal cancer and vitamin D. While they initially found over 10,000 studies, they ended up with 50 after sifting through them and removing duplicates and those that didn’t meet their criteria.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers only wanted to include studies in adult human participants who either had colorectal cancer (or precursors for colorectal cancer) or had a documented vitamin D deficiency. They also sought out cases where participants were given a vitamin D supplement as part of the study.\n\nWhat Did It Show?\n\nAccording to these researchers, vitamin D has been shown to have many benefits in our bodies, including supporting communication between nerve cells, regulating blood pressure and preventing respiratory infections. It plays roles in maintaining gut health, thyroid hormone levels, blood sugar levels and even mitigating the harmful effects of aging. Vitamin D also acts as an antioxidant, reducing inflammation, suppressing autoimmune responses and supporting the function of immune cells.\n\nThe researchers also cite a previous study that suggests that vitamin D inhibits uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of new blood vessels that “feed” cancer cells (called angiogenesis) and promotes apoptosis (killing abnormal cells).\n\nSo what did these researchers find regarding vitamin D and colorectal cancer? While there was some conflicting evidence, they state that vitamin D deficiency is strongly linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer, partly because that deficiency exacerbates intestinal inflammation, which promotes colorectal cancer progression.\n\nSpecifically, one meta-analysis of 31 original studies reported that compared to people with the lowest dietary intake of vitamin D (10 ng/mL), those with the highest amount (80 ng/mL) showed a 25% reduction in colorectal cancer risk.\n\nThe Nurses’ Health Study, a large long-term U.S. study commonly used to find connections between lifestyle factors and disease risk, showed that women with the highest vitamin D intake had a 58% reduced risk of colorectal cancer compared to those with the lowest intake.\n\nThe Iowa Women’s Health Study found that those with the highest calcium and vitamin D intake reduced their risk of colorectal cancer by about half. The Spanish PREDIMED study had similar results, as did studies that used vitamin D supplementation (as opposed to getting it through food).\n\nPolyps and adenomas are precursors to colorectal cancer and are commonly found and removed during colonoscopies. Researchers found evidence that vitamin D can also help prevent polyps. For example, a Canadian study with 1,409 participants found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the probability of polyp development by 33% and the risk of high-risk adenomatous polyps by 43%.\n\nOverall, researchers found that vitamin D, both dietary and supplemented, plays a crucial role in preventing and treating colorectal cancer by reducing inflammation, regulating immune responses, promoting cancer cell death and inhibiting tumor growth. For those who have colorectal cancer, vitamin D may help promote better survival rates and reduce death rates from colorectal cancer.\n\nThere were a few limitations to this review. First, though many studies showed protective benefits of vitamin D on colorectal cancer, most could not define the mechanisms through which these benefits occurred. Study authors also state that more large-scale, randomized clinical trials need to be done, which will provide more answers, including optimal dosage and formulations of vitamin D supplements.\n\nHow Does This Apply to Real Life?\n\nBased on the evidence in this review, vitamin D appears to help prevent colorectal cancer and may help people with colorectal cancer survive it. Unfortunately, vitamin D is a commonly deficient vitamin. Worldwide, vitamin D deficiency is estimated to range from 30% to 50%, with even higher rates seen in specific populations.\n\nRisk factors for vitamin D deficiency include being a woman, living in regions that experience colder winter climates, having darker skin and living in a low- and middle-income country where proper nutrition and supplements may be more limited.\n\nBesides having a genetic predisposition for colorectal cancer, other risk factors include older age, sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in unhealthy fats and red meat and low in fiber. An imbalanced gut microbiome also plays a role, as do having inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, frailty and diabetes.\n\nVitamin D is called the sunshine vitamin because your body manufactures it with exposure to UVB rays—aka sunshine. But if you live in a region that experiences cold winters, it can be difficult or impossible to get enough sun exposure during those months. In the warmer months, you should consider your skin cancer risk and balance it with sun exposure. You also need to have enough skin exposure to make vitamin D—face, arms and legs. Plus, pollution, darker skin and possibly sunscreen reduce sunlight absorption, reducing vitamin D production. For these reasons, diet and supplementation may be more reliable avenues for getting enough vitamin D.\n\nBecause it is possible to overdo it and end up with vitamin D toxicity, before you start putting the vitamin D supplements to use, it helps to know your blood levels. This can be done by requesting a blood test from your primary care practitioner. If you end up being deficient, meeting with a registered dietitian can help you figure out what foods and how much of each you need to eat each day to get your levels up. A registered dietitian (RD) can also help you supplement, if that is your desire or if it’s recommended.\n\nAnother finding from this review was that healthy eating patterns, like the Mediterranean diet, tend to be plentiful in vitamin D and other anti-inflammatory nutrients. The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, fish, dairy and healthy fats. While there aren’t a lot of food sources of vitamin D, ones that contain it include egg yolks, fatty fish (like salmon, tuna, mackerel and sardines) and some mushrooms. Fortified dairy products and orange juices also contain vitamin D. Researchers note that a holistic dietary approach may be a better strategy than focusing on one isolated nutrient.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis review of 50 studies found a strong connection between adequate vitamin D levels and a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. Because vitamin D deficiency is so common, it can be helpful to have blood work to test your levels. Based on the results, if you need to increase your levels, try adding foods rich in vitamin D, including whole eggs, salmon, mushrooms and fortified dairy products, like milk and yogurt, to your diet. Following a healthy eating pattern, like the Mediterranean diet, can also be beneficial.\n\nIf you choose to supplement, work with a registered dietitian or your primary care practitioner to determine the best dose for you. When possible, spend time outside to catch some rays. Being outdoors also has mental health and mood benefits—all the better if your physical activity is performed outside.\n\n"

            "content": "A tiny device can be inserted using a syringe and then safely dissolves once it is no longer needed.\n\nEngineers at Northwestern University have developed an ultra-small pacemaker that is so tiny it can be injected into the body using a syringe.\n\nWhile it is compatible with hearts of various sizes, the pacemaker is especially well-suited for the delicate hearts of newborns with congenital heart defects.\n\nSmaller than a grain of rice, the device works in tandem with a lightweight, flexible, wireless wearable that attaches to the patient’s chest. When the wearable senses an irregular heartbeat, it automatically emits a pulse of light to activate the pacemaker. These brief light pulses pass through the skin, breastbone, and muscle tissue to regulate the heart’s rhythm.\n\nDesigned for patients who require only temporary pacing, the pacemaker dissolves on its own once it is no longer needed. All of its components are biocompatible, allowing them to break down naturally in the body’s biofluids. This eliminates the need for surgical removal.\n\nThe study was recently published in the journal Nature. The paper demonstrates the device’s efficacy across a series of large and small animal models as well as human hearts from deceased organ donors.\n\n“We have developed what is, to our knowledge, the world’s smallest pacemaker,” said Northwestern bioelectronics pioneer John A. Rogers, who led the device development. “There’s a crucial need for temporary pacemakers in the context of pediatric heart surgeries, and that’s a use case where size miniaturization is incredibly important. In terms of the device load on the body — the smaller, the better.”\n\n“Our major motivation was children,” said Northwestern experimental cardiologist Igor Efimov, who co-led the study. “About 1% of children are born with congenital heart defects — regardless of whether they live in a low-resource or high-resource country. The good news is that these children only need temporary pacing after a surgery. In about seven days or so, most patients’ hearts will self-repair. But those seven days are absolutely critical. Now, we can place this tiny pacemaker on a child’s heart and stimulate it with a soft, gentle, wearable device. And no additional surgery is necessary to remove it.”\n\n\n\nPulsing light from the accompanying wearable activates the pacemaker and controls pacing. Credit: John A. Rogers/Northwestern University\n\nRogers is the Louis Simpson and Kimberly Querrey Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, Biomedical Engineering and Neurological Surgery at Northwestern — where he has appointments in the McCormick School of Engineering and Feinberg School of Medicine — and the director of the Querrey Simpson Institute of Bioelectronics. Efimov is a professor of biomedical engineering at McCormick and professor of medicine (cardiology) at Feinberg. Rogers and Efimov co-led the study with Yonggang Huang, the Jan and Marcia Achenbach Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Civil and Environmental Engineering at McCormick; Wei Ouyang, an assistant professor of engineering at Dartmouth College; and Rishi Arora, the Harold H. Hines Jr. Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago.\n\nMeeting an unmet clinical need\n\nThis work builds on a previous collaboration between Rogers and Efimov, in which they developed the first dissolvable device for temporary pacing. Many patients require temporary pacemakers after heart surgery — either while waiting for a permanent pacemaker or to help restore a normal heart rate during recovery.\n\nFor the current standard of care, surgeons sew the electrodes onto the heart muscle during surgery. Wires from the electrodes exit the front of a patient’s chest, where they connect to an external pacing box that delivers a current to control the heart’s rhythm.\n\nWhen the temporary pacemaker is no longer needed, physicians remove the pacemaker electrodes. Potential complications include infection, dislodgement, torn or damaged tissues, bleeding, and blood clots.\n\n“Wires literally protrude from the body, attached to a pacemaker outside the body,” Efimov said. “When the pacemaker is no longer needed, a physician pulls it out. The wires can become enveloped in scar tissue. So, when the wires are pulled out, that can potentially damage the heart muscle. That’s actually how Neil Armstrong died. He had a temporary pacemaker after a bypass surgery. When the wires were removed, he experienced internal bleeding.”\n\nIn response to this clinical need, Rogers, Efimov and their teams developed their dissolvable pacemaker, which was introduced in Nature Biotechnology in 2021. The thin, flexible, lightweight device eliminated the need for bulky batteries and rigid hardware, including wires. Rogers’ lab had previously invented the concept of bioresorbable electronic medicine — electronics that provide a therapeutic benefit to the patient and then harmlessly dissolve in the body like absorbable sutures. By varying the composition and thickness of the materials in these devices, Rogers’ team can control the precise number of days they remain functional before dissolving.\n\nBody fluid-powered battery\n\nWhile the original quarter-size dissolvable pacemaker worked well in pre-clinical animal studies, cardiac surgeons asked if it was possible to make the device smaller. Then it would be better suited to non-invasive implantation and for use in the smallest patients. But the device was powered by near-field communication protocols — the same technology used in smartphones for electronic payments and in RFID tags — which required a built-in antenna.\n\n“Our original pacemaker worked well,” Rogers said. “It was thin, flexible, and fully resorbable. But the size of its receiver antenna limited our ability to miniaturize it. Instead of using the radio frequency scheme for wireless control, we developed a light-based scheme for turning the pacemaker on and delivering stimulation pulses to the surface of the heart. This is one feature that allowed us to dramatically reduce the size.”\n\n\n\nDesigned for temporary pacing, the tiny pacemaker simply dissolves when it’s no longer needed. By harmlessly degrading within the body, it bypasses the need for surgical extraction. Credit: John A. Rogers/Northwestern University\n\nTo help further reduce the device’s size, the researchers also reimagined its power source. Instead of using near-field communication to supply power, the new, tiny pacemaker operates through the action of a galvanic cell, a type of simple battery that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy. Specifically, the pacemaker uses two different metals as electrodes to deliver electrical pulses to the heart. When in contact with surrounding biofluids, the electrodes form a battery. The resulting chemical reactions cause the electrical current to flow to stimulate the heart.\n\n“When the pacemaker is implanted into the body, the surrounding biofluids act as the conducting electrolyte that electrically joins those two metal pads to form the battery,” Rogers said. “A very tiny light-activated switch on the opposite side from the battery allows us to turn the device from its ‘off’ state to an ‘on’ state upon delivery of light that passes through the patient’s body from the skin-mounted patch.”\n\nPulsing with light\n\nThe team used an infrared wavelength of light that penetrates deeply and safely into the body. If the patient’s heart rate drops below a certain rate, the wearable device detects the event and automatically activates a light-emitting diode. The light then flashes on and off at a rate that corresponds to the normal heart rate.\n\n“Infrared light penetrates very well through the body,” Efimov said. “If you put a flashlight against your palm, you will see the light glow through the other side of your hand. It turns out that our bodies are great conductors of light.”\n\nEven though the pacemaker is so tiny — measuring just 1.8 millimeters in width, 3.5 millimeters in length, and 1 millimeter in thickness — it still delivers as much stimulation as a full-sized pacemaker.\n\n“The heart requires a tiny amount of electrical stimulation,” Rogers said. “By minimizing the size, we dramatically simplify the implantation procedures, we reduce trauma and risk to the patient, and, with the dissolvable nature of the device, we eliminate any need for secondary surgical extraction procedures.”\n\nMore sophisticated synchronization\n\nBecause the devices are so tiny, physicians could distribute collections of them across the heart. A difficult color of light could illuminate to independently control a specific pacemaker. Use of multiple pacemakers in this manner enables more sophisticated synchronization compared to traditional pacing. In special cases, different areas of the heart can be paced at different rhythms, for example, to terminate arrhythmias.\n\n“We can deploy a number of such small pacemakers onto the outside of the heart and control each one,” Efimov said. “Then we can achieve improved synchronized functional care. We also could incorporate our pacemakers into other medical devices like heart valve replacements, which can cause heart block.”\n\n“Because it’s so small, this pacemaker can be integrated with almost any kind of implantable device,” Rogers said. “We also demonstrated integration of collections of these devices across the frameworks that serve as transcatheter aortic valve replacements. Here, the tiny pacemakers can be activated as necessary to address complications that can occur during a patient’s recovery process. So that’s just one example of how we can enhance traditional implants by providing more functional stimulation.”\n\nThe technology’s versatility opens a broad range of other possibilities for use in bioelectronic medicines, including helping nerves and bones heal, treating wounds, and blocking pain.\n\nReference: “Millimetre-scale bioresorbable optoelectronic systems for electrotherapy” by Yamin Zhang, Eric Rytkin, Liangsong Zeng, Jong Uk Kim, Lichao Tang, Haohui Zhang, Aleksei Mikhailov, Kaiyu Zhao, Yue Wang, Li Ding, Xinyue Lu, Anastasia Lantsova, Elena Aprea, Gengming Jiang, Shupeng Li, Seung Gi Seo, Tong Wang, Jin Wang, Jiayang Liu, Jianyu Gu, Fei Liu, Keith Bailey, Yat Fung Larry Li, Amy Burrell, Anna Pfenniger, Andrey Ardashev, Tianyu Yang, Naijia Liu, Zengyao Lv, Nathan S.

            "description": "Ever heard of a \"manure lagoon\"?",
            "content": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nYou likely buy some grocery items for convenience, to save a couple of steps when it’s time to prepare a meal. Prewashed bagged greens, such as lettuce or spinach, seem like a no-brainer if you’re trying to eat nutritiously. But not so fast ...\n\nAccording to food safety experts, prewashed bagged greens aren’t the safest choice. Bacteria and contamination are more common than you may suspect in this particular grocery item.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“While consumers expect convenience and safety, the reality is that prewashed bagged greens remain one of the riskiest items in the grocery store due to contamination risks throughout the supply chain,” says Darin Detwiler, a professor of food policy at Northeastern University and author of “Food Safety: Past, Present, and Predictions.” He avoids buying bagged greens because of the risk of deadly E. coli contamination. “When you look at past outbreaks, bagged salads have been a leading cause of foodborne illness, with some outbreaks resulting in hospitalizations, kidney failure (hemolytic uremic syndrome), and even death,” Detwiler said.\n\nYou’re not imagining it — there are a lot of outbreaks.\n\nMany factors in the supply chain can contaminate the greens with pathogens — such as E. coli, listeria or salmonella — that can leave people sick, hospitalized or worse. “Bagged greens are washed and processed in large batches, which is an effective way to spread pathogens,” said Olivia Roszkowski, chef-instructor of plant-based culinary arts and food safety certification at the Institute of Culinary Education’s New York City campus.\n\nLeafy green outbreaks happen more than you’d expect, and the FDA created a Leafy Greens STEC Action Plan in 2020 to reduce different strains of E. coli in leafy greens and updated the plan in 2023. (For example, shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 is the pathogenic strain that is often associated with lettuce and leafy green outbreaks, and Detwiler says it “is particularly dangerous because it takes a very small amount to cause severe illness. ... The risk isn’t theoretical — it’s been repeatedly proven in outbreak after outbreak.” )\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStefano Oppo via Getty Images The greens that end up in a bag can come from multiple different farms and locations.\n\nAnd despite the efforts to reduce leafy green-related outbreaks, they continue to occur. Leafy greens are attributed to “up to 9.2% of known pathogen-caused foodborne illnesses” in the U.S., according to a report in the Journal of Foodborne Illness published in April 2024. The report estimates over 2.3 million illnesses every year are related to contaminated leafy greens.\n\nHow the food supply chain becomes contaminated\n\nOn the farm\n\nContamination can occur at different stages before bagged salad greens reach the refrigerated produce section and eventually your plate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“In the field, produce can become contaminated with pathogens from sources such as contaminated irrigation water, wild or domesticated animals, soil, or air,” said Kimberly Baker, a food systems and safety program team director at Clemson University. It’s more common to have contaminated greens “when the field is in close proximity to livestock farms or feedlots where animals are being held in densely populated conditions,” Roszkowski explained.\n\nArizona and California are big producers of leafy greens in the United States and are often near large cattle operations, according to Detwiler. E. coli, salmonella, or listeria can be introduced to the crops through contaminated irrigation water from nearby cattle farms, he said.\n\n“Runoff from manure lagoons can seep into irrigation canals and contaminate fields with deadly bacteria like E. coli O157:H7,” Detwiler continued. Manure lagoons are large pits where livestock waste is stored, per Environmental America. And it’s not only contaminated water that can be a problem. Some farms use unregulated water sources to irrigate the fields. “Some farms use untreated or minimally treated surface water from rivers, lakes or canals, increasing the risk of contamination,” Detwiler said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it’s time to harvest, there are added risks for pathogens and bacteria to come in contact with lettuce. “Contamination can occur through human handling, contaminated equipment or water used in post-harvest processes to transport, produce or remove soil,” Baker said.\n\nIn the processing plant\n\nThere are opportunities for pathogens to come in contact with leafy greens once they reach a processing plant. The greens you get in a bag don’t typically come from one field but from multiple farms, complicating traceability and increasing contamination.\n\nGreens are processed in a centralized area and distributed — which is convenient for all the companies involved in the process— but not ideal from a food safety standpoint. “Greens from different farms are mixed, washed and packaged together, so one contaminated leaf can impact thousands of bags across multiple states,” Detwiler explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLettuce is washed in large vats, added Rosemary Trout, associate professor and program director of Culinary Arts & Food Science at Drexel University. What you may not suspect, according to Trout, is that “plant foods are usually more often associated with foodborne illness than animal products.”\n\nOn the journey to store shelves\n\nKeeping the greens cold is necessary to prevent any pathogens from growing and spreading. According to Roszkowski, “Not keeping the greens consistently cold throughout the process of harvesting, processing and transporting can cause bacterial growth to occur.”\n\nHowever, refrigeration doesn’t eliminate the chance of pathogens; it can help slow them down. “Refrigeration slows bacterial growth but does not kill bacteria, meaning contaminated greens can still cause illness, even if stored properly,” Detwiler said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill washing prewashed salad greens help?\n\nIf you’re thinking, “Well, I’ll wash my prewashed greens for extra safety measures,” don’t. Washing greens at home doesn’t make them safer because water won’t remove the pathogens, Detwiler said. Rinsing prewashed greens can introduce pathogens that may be lurking on your counter or sink. “Prewashed greens should not be rewashed at home, as doing so can introduce contamination if the sink, utensils, equipment or hands of the preparer are not properly cleaned or sanitized,” Baker said.\n\nWestend61 via Getty Images Washing greens can remove pesticides, but it's not been proven to be effective in removing pathogens.\n\nBacteria or pathogens aren’t obvious and can’t be seen. “If greens are contaminated with pathogens, they cannot be detected by sight, smell or taste … and can’t be removed by washing,” Baker explained. According to Detwiler, “Bacteria like E. coli and salmonella can form biofilms that help them stick to the surface of the leaves [and] once attached, these bacteria do not simply rinse off.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarmful pathogens need to be cooked to be eliminated, as heat kills them, said Detwiler. A big issue with lettuce is it’s usually eaten raw, not cooked, “making it challenging to reduce the risk of foodborne illness,” Baker said.\n\nRecommendations for buying bagged greens\n\nIf you still prefer buying bagged greens for the convenience, there are several precautions to take.\n\nCheck for recalls\n\nBefore you purchase any salad greens, check if there are any recalls, advised Detwiler and Roszkowski. “Stay updated on recalls via the FDA and CDC websites,” Detwiler said. “If your greens are part of an outbreak, throw them away immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck expiration dates\n\nExperts say you should look at the expiration dates before purchasing. Trout advises to only buy what you will eat within a day or two.\n\nLook for freshness\n\nAvoid bags with excess moisture that look wet, as damp environments are a haven for bacteria to thrive, Detwiler said. “Inspect the package to ensure the lettuce looks fresh, without wilting or discoloration, as these signs may indicate improper storage or reduced freshness,” Baker said. You also want to stay away from any bags that have slimy leaves, Roszkowski added.\n\nMinimize temperature changes\n\nOnce you’ve purchased greens, don’t let them sit in a hot car or garage or out on the counter. “Avoid drastic changes in temperature when transporting them from the store and when preparing a meal,” Roszkowski said. “This leads to condensation and creates a moist and warm environment that can encourage both spoilage and bacterial growth.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStore properly\n\nGreens should be kept refrigerated at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, say Detwiler and Trout.\n\nBuy heads of lettuce"

            "description": "Studies have found microplastics in humans. If you want to lessen the impact, try these kitchen swaps, from $7 at Amazon.",
            "content": "It’s no secret that microplastics are a real concern. A 2024 study conducted in New Mexico found that these particles are lingering in our bodies. After 52 autopsies, scientists discovered microplastics in patients’ brains. They could even leech into the blood through the blood-brain barrier. Now, it doesn’t mean we need to remove all traces of plastic from our lives—that is physically impossible and mentally exhausting. But we can make some simple swaps to reduce exposure.\n\nTry swapping plastic containers for glass containers, plastic produce bags for reusable cloth bags or plastic prep bowls for glass bowls. You don’t need to swap everything here, either—I just go with what works best in my routine and fits my budget. The alternatives below are simple to use and maintain, and prices start at $7.\n\nDitch: Flimsy Plastic Containers\n\nGrab: Durable Glass Containers\n\nPyrex Simply Store 18-Piece Glass Container Set\n\nAmazon\n\nI always prefer the fuss-free nature of glass containers: they don’t stain, absorb odor or require scrubbing. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a set without plastic lids, but this doesn’t bother me too much, especially when it comes to my top pick from Pyrex. It’s also one of our favorite glass container sets after rigorous testing. They seal well, are easy to clean and maintain a smooth, sleek finish and absorb no stains or smells.\n\nBall 4-Piece Glass Mason Jar Set\n\nAmazon\n\nMason jars are a must for the pantry and refrigerator. Take them on the go with berries, snacks or overnight oats stored inside. Or, use them to store pantry staples, dressings and prepped vegetables like carrots and jams. The jars make an excellent set because you get four jars in different sizes: two 16-ounce and two 32-ounce jars. They’re both wide-mouth, which means you’re not limited to a narrow lid for storing specific things you don’t need to reach in for, like sauces. They’re reusable, have a tight seal, and are so multi-purpose that you’d be doing yourself a disservice if you didn’t have them.\n\nDitch: Plastic Wrap\n\nGrab: Reusable Wrap\n\nBee's Wrap Reusable Beeswax Food Wrap\n\nAmazon\n\nIt is nice to have plastic wrap on hand, especially for food safety (i.e., raw meat or fish), but a lot of the time it can be replaced with this reusable beeswax wrap. Think: storing odds and ends of produce and bread, wrapping a bowl of a pre-made salad for a barbecue, sealing leftover butter—the list can go on. It seals using a sticky wax-based coating that is washable and reusable. Because you can cut pieces to the size you need, like plastic wrap, you’re not limited in terms of uses.\n\nDitch: Plastic Produce Bags\n\nGrab: Reusable Cloth Bags\n\nOrganic Cotton Mart 6-Piece Reusable Cotton Mesh Produce Bag Set\n\nAmazon\n\nUsing plastic produce bags is arguably wasteful and unnecessary. These cotton mesh bags come in sizes between 12 x 15 inches and 8 x 10 inches and are made with a washable cotton material. They have a drawstring closure to keep your ingredients locked in. I love that they’re mesh because the ingredients can breathe, and you can easily see what’s inside. If you prefer an option with no holes, the brand offers this cotton set for a similar price.\n\nDitch: Plastic Condiment and Dressing Containers\n\nGrab: Durable and Reusable Glass Containers\n\nVitever 6-Piece Glass Condiment Jar Set\n\nAmazon\n\nIt’s a good idea to replace plastic dressing containers with this set of glass jars. They’re a generous size at 2.6 ounces and are perfect for jams, sauces, homemade dressings and other condiments like ketchup. Plus, they’re completely leakproof: The plastic lid twists on tight, similar to a mason jar, so you can carry on without worrying about any sudden spills or drips if you’re on the go.\n\nDitch: Plastic Straws\n\nGrab: Reusable Straws\n\nHiware 12-Piece Stainless Steel Straw Set\n\nAmazon\n\nAt this point, we all know that a plastic straw isn’t the best option, but those paper straws are far from perfect. I prefer stainless steel straws like these because I know they’ll last and I can comfortably use them for hot drinks. With the included brush, they’re also easy to clean. I tend to wash them straight away, so I know I can get all of the remnants out immediately. (Dried, stuck-on bits are these straws' enemy.) I’ve had mine for years and they’re still as good as new. This set is only $7 and comes with 12 straws, so there’s plenty to go around all week.\n\nDitch: Plastic Cutting Board\n\nGrab: Composite or Wood Cutting Board\n\nEpicurean Composite Cutting Board\n\nAmazon\n\nI love plastic cutting boards because they’re great at preventing cross-contamination, but sadly, they leak microplastics into our food. A 2024 Environmental Science & Technology study confirmed that they leech these tiny particles into your produce and meat during prepping. Still, I never really knew what to replace them with. That is, until someone recommended this Epicurean Composite option to me. It’s made from Richlite paper, composed of—you guessed it—paper. It is fused with a form of resin to harden it, however thermosetting resins are a type of plastic that are more stable than typical plastics and don't leach microplastics under normal use.\n\nJohn Boos Chop-N-Slice Wood Cutting Board\n\nAmazon\n\nWooden cutting boards are another fantastic choice. Starting with a good quality option is ideal for easier maintenance, and we love this John Boos board. It’s 20 x 15 x 1.25 inches, so there’s a ton of surface area to work with, which is why it's our favorite larger option. It’s also designed to be double-sided, getting double the lifespan. Boos cutting boards are one of my favorite wooden options and I've used them often in professional kitchens because they’re well-made and durable.\n\nDitch: Plastic Prep Bowls\n\nGrab: Glass Bowls\n\nPyrex 3-Piece Glass Bowl Set\n\nAmazon\n\nI couldn’t go without these Pyrex bowls. Not only are they a better pick compared to plastic, they’re also more effective. They’re microwave- and dishwasher-safe, plus you can trust that they can hold hot things without breaking. Because they’re glass, they’re see-through, so I can see if anything needs to be mixed more, like a homemade muffin batter. The lip on the edge also makes these maneuverable. With three different sizes, it’s an everyday essential.\n\n"

            "content": "Care and Feeding is Slate’s parenting advice column. Have a question for Care and Feeding? Submit it here.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI know the general rule is don’t comment on other people’s parenting and don’t give unsolicited parenting advice. But! Can you ask a parent to change the way they behave in front of you and your kid? I have some friends, “Elo” and “Raven,” whose 3-year-old, “Jax,” is one of my 3-year-old’s best friends. Elo and Raven divorced when Jax was about 1 ½—thank god, because the tension was through the roof when we all hung out. I love hanging out with Elo and Jax, but I really struggle when I spend time with Raven. Jax has autism and some developmental delays, but in many ways they also behave like any other 3-year-old. Jax is verbal, responds to questions and redirection, and is constantly learning and changing. Every time I see them, I can tell they’ve made leaps in their development, even if their speech and reactions are not the same as a neurotypical 3-year-old. But Raven is always making comments in front of Jax and my child about how Jax “doesn’t understand anything that goes on around them,” and constantly compares our kids: “oh, it’s so nice that your kid takes turns/is calm/knows their name; Jax doesn’t know how to do that and probably never will.”\n\nIt’s painful to witness, because it’s so clear that Jax understands everything, even if their responses are not exactly the same as my kid’s. I’m sure it’s self-preservation from having a child with more challenges than Raven expected, but Jax is a smart, sweet kid and Raven needs to see that! I don’t want my child to hear Raven comparing them with Jax. I don’t think it’s appropriate, and I want them to stop doing it. I also want them to stop telling me Jax doesn’t understand anything. Can I ask for these boundaries to be in place when my child and I are present? I’m thinking about writing Raven a letter, because they generally don’t respond well to feedback. It doesn’t feel appropriate to involve Elo even though Elo is also Jax’s parent, because Elo and Raven are divorced.\n\n—Kids Shouldn’t Be Compared\n\nDear Shouldn’t Be Compared,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis would bum me out, too. As the fellow parent of an autistic child, the most generous (possibly too generous?) interpretation I can muster is that Raven may be in pretty ableist medical and/or educational environments that encourage them to do exactly what they’re doing: compare their kid to others, and pay more attention to deficits than strengths. Of course, Raven is allowed to have feelings about Jax’s autism or the support they need. And sure, at least some of Raven’s comments are probably the result of processing those thoughts and feelings aloud, with someone they assume will be somewhat sympathetic (you).\n\nBut there’s what you feel, and then there’s what you do with those feelings. Raven is making whatever problems she’s having Jax’s problems, too (and yours!). It just isn’t appropriate to vent your fears or frustrations about your disabled 3-year-old in front of said 3-year-old—sorry, but you’ve gotta pick a different time, a different place, a different way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen encountering ableist parents (and it’s always sadder but unsurprising to me when they have disabled kids themselves), I usually go with one of two options. The easy one is distance: If the relationship isn’t super important to me, I might just let it go, because my time is finite and I don’t need to expose myself or my kid to any more ableism than we already encounter. The other option is (somewhat grudging) education—I don’t mean that I try to engage them in Disability 101 or whatever, but I’ll correct false assertions or push back when needed. I might go so far as to explain why something they said about autism is wrong, or perhaps cite a source like the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network. I have also had to ask some parents to talk to their own kids about ableism, after those kids said or did something harmful to my kid. Sometimes, though, these things lead us back to distance—either because the other parent/family’s ableism is a dealbreaker for me, or because the other parent just finds me super annoying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is all to say that if you don’t want to hear ableist stuff from a fellow parent, and you don’t want your kid hearing it, either—or taking your silence for agreement—I think it’s OK for you to say something. And I don’t even really think it is about Jax’s parenting; it’s more about how you want to parent your own child. You seem to want them to appreciate and enjoy all kinds of people. You don’t want them to grow up ableist. You don’t want them to think worse of Jax or other kids like them—you want them to respect and see whatever is good in every kid they meet, and not assume that autistic or disabled kids can’t be smart or fun or wonderful friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can think about whether you really want to try to let Raven know about those things you want for your kid, and how—in a letter; in person; parent to parent; etc. But as you probably already know, it might not lead to the outcome you want. Raven might not be in a place where they can hear what you’re saying, or view their situation differently. They might also get mad at you, no matter how kind or careful you try to be. And in the end, they’re going to parent how they choose to parent, and they and Jax will bear the consequences. If they keep making their ableist remarks and it turns out to be a dealbreaker for you, then you may need to decide whether your kid mostly sees Jax during Elo’s time rather than Raven’s. You don’t have the power to change Raven, but you do get to choose what you’re willing to put up with, and what you want your child to hear and absorb.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet parenting and family advice—submit a question!

It was obviously devastating. My heart is broken for her. I live on the other side of the country, so I haven’t been able to be as present as I would like. I’m planning a trip over the summer to her coast and I definitely want to see her, but I’m struggling with how to plan the trip without overburdening her and her husband. Normally, I would just ask to stay with them for a few days, but I don’t know if they would want a house guest. But I also think she might be upset if I say I’m staying at an Airbnb in their town. They live pretty far away from other friends I could stay with, but it wouldn’t be impossible to meet for lunch somewhere in the middle. How can I plan this trip to maximize support but minimize stress for them? I just want to give her a hug and make them a meal.\n\n—Too Timid to Ask\n\nDear Too Timid,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s kind of you to want to offer in-person support to your friend, assuming she is open to it. I understand why you might prefer not to ask, but in this case, I think there’s no avoiding it—not if you actually want to ascertain and respect her wishes. Unless you talk about it with her, you’re reduced to guessing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI really can’t imagine a friend being offended by your wish to see her and cause as little stress as possible. And I think you can try to bring up the possibility of a visit in a way that puts the least amount of pressure on her. First, let her know that you’re planning to be in the area, and you’d love to see her if she has time. And then just make it clear that you’d be open to doing so in whatever way would be best for her, perhaps something like: “Of course I’d be glad to stay with you, but I’m also very happy to stay somewhere else if that’s easier. I can come over and make a meal, or we can meet for lunch if you’d prefer. Think about it and let me know—I hope to see and catch up, and also have this visit be as easy as possible for you.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’d try to have the initial conversation soon/several weeks before you travel. Then your friend will know all the options and have time to think it over; she won’t feel the pressure of needing to answer right away. She can let you know how she’s feeling about the visit, and what she’d like to do, as your trip gets closer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatch Up on Care and Feeding\n\n· Missed earlier columns this week?

The switch was sudden despite no major life changes. She is my fourth child, so I know a lot of the recommendations already (keep naptime consistent, darken the room, remove distractions) and follow them—I just have not had a child do this before. I have a childproof lock over the doorknob and she will stay in her room for over an hour for “rest,” but she rarely sleeps. I plan to keep enforcing “rest time” and hope she goes back to napping eventually, but in the meantime, do you know anyone who has had a similar experience and lived to tell the tale? Did their kid go back to napping?\n\n—Slumber Management\n\nDear Slumber Management,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have been there! My younger child was never a great napper, and gave it up somewhere between 2 and 2 ½. We referred to that last hour or so before her 7pm bedtime as witching hour, because, well, none of us were at our best. In our case, once the nap was gone, it never came back. But of course it’s possible that your child is just on a nap strike, and will eventually go back to sleeping during the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether that happens or not, I think trying to preserve at last the idea of nap time—creating the ideal nap time conditions!—still makes a lot of sense. Even if your 2-year-old doesn’t fall asleep, the chill quiet time is probably good for her (and for you). It can also flow nicely into her having chunks of increasingly independent time, when she doesn’t expect you or anyone else to entertain her.\n\n—Nicole\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy wife and I have a dilemma: My mom lives just downstairs from us and is 90 percent awesome with our 5-year-old son. She helps with school drop-off and pickup, does a few hours of child care on the weekend, and is always ready to randomly babysit whenever we need. The 10 percent: Whenever he goes down to visit her, he gets banana bread, trail mix with M&Ms, lemonade (not cut with water or seltzer), and other things we would consider “sometimes” foods. The notorious “free” babysitting strikes again! What can we do?"

            "description": "The Trump administration's cuts to HIV prevention will lead to new infections, medical costs and death, experts warn.",
            "content": "Doctors and public health advocates were once able to imagine the end of the HIV epidemic in our lifetime. The last four decades of scientific advancements had delivered new treatments and preventive medications that significantly curbed the rates of transmission and impacts of the once deadly virus. The number of new infections has dropped from more than 130,000 in the mid- 1980s to 37,000 by 2022 — and mortality rates have steadily dropped.\n\nMillions in federal funding — supported by Democratic and Republican leadership alike ― had helped buoy a swath of programs and research into new injectable drugs for HIV prevention and treatment, which are long-lasting and less burdensome than daily medication, and can be used to address HIV disparities across race, gender and sexual orientation both in the United States and internationally.\n\n“With the advent of injectables and how successful they’ve been, I think for many of us, for the first time in a long time, we could actually see what looked like the beginning of the end,” said Tori Cooper, the director of strategic outreach and training at Human Rights Campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in March, that glimmer of hope began to fade as the Trump administration decimated the nation’s HIV prevention programs as part of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s drastic overhaul of the Department of Health and Human Services agency.\n\nThe Office of Infectious Diseases & HIV Policy, which oversees the federal strategy on HIV prevention, shuttered its doors. Ten thousand federal health employees were laid off, including staff at five branches of the HIV prevention division of the Centers for Disease Control, who are tasked with tracking new infections and conducting research on strategies to reduce infection risk.\n\nTop staffers, including Jonathan Mermin, the director of the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD and Tuberculosis Prevention ― which lost a quarter of their staff ― were reassigned to the Indian Health Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA preliminary HHS budget, obtained by The Washington Post on Wednesday, offers a window into the Trump administration’s priorities, and paints a picture of an even slimmer and reorganized health agency. The proposed budget slashes one-third of the agency’s spending, and eliminates funding for HIV services, including the Minority AIDS Initiative, several Ryan White HIV/AIDS programs, the CDC’s HIV/AIDs prevention and surveillance activities, and preventive services for elderly people and people living with disabilities.\n\n“It’s spelling out a situation where we’re going to see more people get HIV and die from AIDS in the U.S. and internationally,” said Jeremiah Johnson, the executive director of PrEP 4 All, an HIV advocacy organization pushing for a nationwide program to boost access to preventive medication to underinsured communities.\n\nThe cuts across federal health agencies have left funding to research institutions dedicated to improving HIV care in limbo. Over the last four months numerous grants were terminated for HIV studies and programs, including a clinical trial to help youth living with or at risk of HIV access vaccines, a trauma-informed study on the role of violence in the lives of women living with HIV, a trial to determine whether Black and Latin men are more likely to stay on PrEP with the help of a patient navigator, and numerous studies on the barriers trans women face to HIV prevention care around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn total, the National Institute of Health has terminated nearly 770 active research grants as of the beginning of April, according to a database kept by academics tracking the cuts. Nearly 29% of grants that have been cut — tallying at around $759 million in funding — involved research into HIV/AIDS.\n\nSince the Food and Drug Administration approved a preventive medication called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, in 2012, the rates of new HIV diagnoses steadily fell in states whose insurance plans covered the drug. PrEP, which is taken routinely in pill form, provides nearly complete protection against the virus.\n\nBut almost two-thirds of the 1.2 million people who could benefit from PrEP are not taking the medication, according to CDC data. The vast majority of people who currently have access to PrEP are white, despite making up a small percentage of new diagnoses. By comparison, Black and Latino populations, and trans women all experience higher and growing rates of HIV diagnoses, especially in Southern and rural areas. These communities face significant barriers to accessing PrEP, including lack of health insurance or other financial barriers, and discrimination in health care settings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPublic health advocates and scientists have researched ways to address these disparities and boost the use of PrEP among at-risk communities. A new injectable version of PrEP called lenacapavir, administered once every six months, has already shown strong signs of being more effective at preventing the virus than daily oral pills, and could help communities that face challenges to consistent medication.\n\nThe FDA will review in June an application for lenacapavir by Gilead, a pharmaceutical company specializing in HIV/AIDS medication. If approved, it would be the second injectable PrEP on the market, following the approval of cabotegravir in 2021. Both long-acting drugs are also used in treatment for people living with HIV, and offer an alternative to people who deal with pill fatigue.\n\nHowever, Johnson anticipates that “we won’t see the kind of launch that we had hoped for” for PrEP “to get out to communities” as the Trump administration continues to slash funding towards HIV prevention research, and as RFK Jr. promotes “non-evidence based understandings of HIV science.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Here we are at a moment of innovation, and rather than capitalize on all of that, we’re going to turn our backs and see more HIV infections and more health care expenditures due to new HIV infections, and a lot more sickness and suffering for our communities,” Johnson said.\n\nIn the past, HHS has promoted low or no cost PrEP to patients through programs like Ready, Set, PrEP, for example. The program was started by then-President Donald Trump in 2019 as part of his Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative. The future of that program is now uncertain as the preliminary HHS budget axes funding for the Ending the HIV Epidemic plan altogether.\n\nBut with RFK Jr. at the helm of the agency, Trump’s initial goalpost for tackling HIV is now much further away. RFK Jr. has a history of discrediting vaccine efficacy, and championing junk science to insist that changes in lifestyle and nutrition could combat chronic illness. In particular, he has questioned the HIV epidemic, including whether the human immunodeficiency virus causes the chronic condition of AIDS, which it does, and instead attributed the condition to the use of poppers, a recreational drug popular in queer communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Ofole Mgbako, an HIV doctor and assistant professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Health, warns that the loss of consistent treatment for HIV could lead to new strains of the virus that are resistant to the drugs currently on hand.\n\n“Treatment interruptions and people being on and off of treatment can breed resistance to the virus. We have not yet found a cure,” Mgbako said. “We have found really effective treatments to keep the virus suppressed within someone’s body, but that means they have to remain on treatment consistently.”\n\nMany of the cuts to grants came after Trump signed several executive orders instructing agencies to axe programs dedicated to improving “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” or addressing trans or broader LGBTQ+ communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn mid-February, nine nonprofit community health and advocacy organizations focused on servicing the health needs of the LGBTQ+ community, including HIV prevention and treatment, sued the Trump administration, alleging that the executive orders resulted in their grants being terminated.\n\nAmong them was the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, which had received a grant concurrently with the University of California San Francisco, to study the effectiveness of Doxy PEP, a drug that helps to prevent bacterial sexually transmitted infections after sex.\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

            "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A federal panel of medical experts on Wednesday recommended an expansion of RSV vaccinations for adults and a new combination shot as another option to protect teens against meningitis.\n\nThe 15-member panel typically makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how vaccines should be used.\n\nBut in a break from decades of practice, the person evaluating Wednesday’s recommendations won’t have a background in medicine: The agency is without a permanent director, so an ex-prosecutor now at the CDC will make the call.\n\nThe decision will fall to the CDC’s chief of staff, Matthew Buzzelli, said Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon.\n\nBuzzelli is not a physician. His CDC bio touts his experience as an attorney, including as a federal prosecutor.\n\nThe scientific panel’s recommendations on Wednesday were:\n\n— People 50 to 59 should be able to get vaccinated against respiratory syncytial virus have risks including heart disease, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.\n\n— Endorsement of a new combination shot made by GSK that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria, including a strain that caused a spate of outbreaks on college campuses about 10 years ago. It would join other products that also target the germs.\n\n— Adding a second chikungunya vaccine to the options for Americans age 12 and older who are traveling to countries where outbreaks of the mosquito-borne illness are occurring. About 100 to 200 cases are reported annually among U.S. travelers.\n\n— Adding a new precaution for the older chikungunya vaccine that uses weakened but live virus: People 65 and older should weigh the risks of benefits of that version of the shot, the panel said. The precaution was added after panel members heard about an investigation into six reports of people 65 and older — most of them with other medical problems — who became ill with heart or brain symptoms less than a week after vaccination. The investigation is continuing.\n\nIt’s not clear how quickly Buzzelli will decide whether to accept the recommendations.\n\nThe Trump administration named Susan Monarez as acting CDC director in January, and last month picked her to lead the agency. But while she’s awaiting Senate confirmation, she has essentially recused herself from regular duties because of federal law around vacancies, according to two CDC officials speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss agency matters and feared being fired.\n\nMonarez holds a doctorate in microbiology and immunology.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

            "content": "Around 41,000 years ago, Earth’s magnetic field underwent a chaotic shift that temporarily weakened the planet’s natural protection from harmful solar radiation.\n\nA new study suggests that early Homo sapiens may have survived – and even thrived – through this period thanks to innovations including tailored clothing, increased use of sun-protective ochre, and strategic sheltering in caves.\n\nMeanwhile, their relatives the Neanderthals, who lacked these adaptations, vanished shortly thereafter.\n\nThe experts used advanced 3D modeling and archaeological evidence to offer a fresh perspective on how one of Earth’s past geomagnetic upheavals – known as the Laschamps excursion – may have influenced human evolution and migration.\n\nThe sky lit up over Europe\n\nThe Laschamps excursion was a geomagnetic event that occurred about 41,000 years ago, during which Earth’s magnetic field temporarily weakened to about 10% of its current strength.\n\nWhile the magnetic poles didn’t fully flip, they did wander significantly – especially over Europe – bringing intense auroras and letting in greater amounts of harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\n\n“In the study, we combined all of the regions where the magnetic field would not have been connected, allowing cosmic radiation, or any kind of energetic particles from the sun, to seep all the way in to the ground,” said lead author Agnit Mukhopadhyay, a research affiliate in climate and space sciences and engineering at University of Michigan.\n\n“We found that many of those regions actually match pretty closely with early human activity from 41,000 years ago, specifically an increase in the use of caves and an increase in the use of prehistoric sunscreen.”\n\nMagnetism and wandering poles\n\nEarth’s magnetic field is generated by the rotation of its molten iron core, creating electrical currents that produce a magnetic shield around the planet.\n\nThis field deflects most of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise reach Earth’s surface and deplete its ozone layer.\n\nWhen the field weakens, as it did during the Laschamps event, it exposes much more of the planet to radiation.\n\nTo explore this ancient episode, the researchers used the Space Weather Modeling Framework – a tool developed at UM’s Center for Space Environment Modeling – to simulate how the Earth’s magnetic field and space plasma system interacted during the Laschamps event.\n\nThe experts then reconstructed the global space environment in 3D by combining models of the geomagnetic field, the surrounding plasma, and auroral activity at the time.\n\nThe resulting simulations revealed a planet dramatically different from what we know today: auroras visible across Europe and northern Africa, and large swaths of the Earth exposed to solar and cosmic radiation.\n\nWhy did Neanderthals vanish?\n\nThis intense solar exposure, researchers suggest, could have pushed early humans to adopt protective strategies. By around 41,000 years ago, Homo sapiens were becoming increasingly common in Europe, while Neanderthals were nearing extinction and soon vanished.\n\n“What some of the differences are between these species, between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans, that might account for that disappearance has been a major anthropological question for decades,” said Raven Garvey, a U-M associate professor of anthropology.\n\nOne possibility? Tailored clothing. Archaeological sites associated with Homo sapiens from this period show evidence of sewing tools – scrapers, awls, and needles – that allowed for the creation of fitted garments.\n\nSuch clothing would have helped protect against cold climates but also may have shielded skin from increased UV exposure.\n\nAccording to the scientists, tailored clothing has a two-fold benefit: it is significantly warmer and this added warmth meant that early humans could travel farther from their hearths and shelters in their search of food.\n\nHuman adaptation and innovation\n\nClothing wasn’t the only adaptation. Homo sapiens also began using ochre more frequently during this period.\n\nOchre, a naturally occurring red or yellow pigment composed of iron oxide, has long been used by human ancestors for decorative and symbolic purposes. But it also has practical benefits.\n\n“There have been some experimental tests that show it has sunscreen-like properties. It’s a pretty effective sunscreen, and there are also ethnographic populations that have used it primarily for that purpose,” Garvey said.\n\n“Its increased production and its association primarily with anatomically modern humans (during the Laschamps) is also suggestive of people’s having used it for this purpose as well.”\n\nResponse to an invisible threat\n\nAnother clue lies in early humans’ use of caves. Archaeological data show a marked increase in cave habitation around the same time as the Laschamps event.\n\nThese natural shelters would have provided physical protection from the radiation pouring in through the weakened magnetic field.\n\nAs Mukhopadhyay and Garvey note, these behaviors – hiding in caves, making more use of ochre, and sewing fitted clothes – are all found in archaeological records.\n\nThe records date back to the Laschamps event, hinting at a collective response to an invisible but potentially deadly threat.\n\nMagnetic field stability and human survival\n\nGarvey is careful to emphasize that the study’s findings. “I think it’s important to note that these findings are correlational and (ours is a) meta analysis, if you will,” she said. “But I think it is a fresh perspective on these data in light of the Laschamps excursion.”\n\nWhile not proof of causation, the overlap between increased human technological behavior and periods of magnetic field instability offers new insight into how Homo sapiens may have gained a survival advantage over Neanderthals.\n\nFuture magnetic field reversal\n\nBeyond its relevance to human prehistory, the study also raises questions about how a future magnetic reversal might affect modern life.\n\nWith Earth’s magnetic field currently weakening and the North Pole slowly drifting, Mukhopadhyay says it’s worth considering what would happen if a similar event occurred today.\n\n“If such an event were to happen today, we would see a complete blackout in several different sectors,” he warned.\n\n“Our communication satellites would not work. Many of our telecommunication arrays, which are on the ground, would be severely affected by the smallest of space weather events, not to mention the human impacts which would also play a pretty massive role in our day-to-day lives.”\n\nCould humans vanish like Neanderthals?\n\nThe research also carries implications for astrobiology. “Many people say that a planet cannot sustain life without a strong magnetic field,” Mukhopadhyay said.\n\n“Looking at prehistoric Earth, and especially at events like this, helps us study exoplanetary physics from a very different vantage point. Life did exist back then. But it was a little bit different than it is today.”\n\nIn the end, the Laschamps excursion offers more than just an explanation for why Neanderthals may have vanished. It’s a reminder that Earth’s magnetic shield, often taken for granted, plays a crucial role in protecting life on our planet. And when it falters, survival may depend on how quickly life can adapt.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Science Advances.\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

            "content": "The phenomenon of “bleeding glaciers” has recently captured scientific attention, revealing a disturbing ecological warning sign. These massive ice formations, once pristine white monuments of nature, now display alarming red patches that researchers compare to blood. This unsettling transformation signals deeper environmental issues that merit urgent consideration as our planet faces unprecedented climate challenges.\n\nThe mysterious red coloration transforming glaciers worldwide\n\nThe eerie red stains appearing on glaciers, often called “watermelon snow” or “glacier blood,” result from microscopic algae blooms. The primary culprit is Chlamydomonas nivalis, an organism that thrives as temperatures rise during summer months in polar regions. These tiny life forms produce a distinctive red pigment as a protective mechanism against harsh ultraviolet radiation.\n\nScientists from the University of the Basque Country have documented increasing occurrences of this phenomenon. José Ignacio García, a leading researcher in the field, warns that these blooms directly correlate with warming trends. The red coloration isn’t merely a visual curiosity – it represents a dangerous feedback loop in the global climate crisis that continues to break CO₂ level records.\n\nA comprehensive study from Simon Fraser University revealed these algae now cover up to 65% of certain glaciers in North America’s northwest regions. This widespread presence has transformed from an isolated observation into a significant climate indicator that scientists monitor closely.\n\nHow glacier formation occurs and why their loss matters\n\nGlaciers form through centuries of snow accumulation in regions where winter snowfall exceeds summer melt. This compressed snow gradually transforms into dense ice under its own weight, creating massive structures that slowly flow downhill due to gravity. These majestic ice formations primarily develop in frigid, high-altitude environments like the Himalayas, Arctic, Alps, and Antarctica.\n\nThese ice giants serve as vital components of Earth’s ecosystem. They act as natural reservoirs, storing approximately 69% of our planet’s freshwater. Additionally, glaciers function as geological sculptors, carving valleys and creating dramatic landscapes through their constant movement.\n\nBeyond their physical presence, glaciers provide critical climate data. Scientists analyze ice cores extracted from ancient glaciers to understand atmospheric composition throughout history. This information helps establish baseline climate patterns, making the current rapid retreat especially alarming – similar to how researchers have identified mechanisms accelerating species collapse in other ecosystems.\n\nThe dangerous feedback loop accelerating ice melt\n\nThe reddening of glaciers creates a perilous cycle that accelerates their destruction. Clean white snow naturally reflects most solar radiation back into space – a property scientists call “albedo.” When algae bloom, turning the surface red or pink, this reflective capacity dramatically decreases.\n\nDarker surfaces absorb more solar energy, raising surface temperatures and increasing melt rates. The resulting meltwater creates ideal conditions for more algal growth, further darkening the surface. This continuous cycle forms a self-reinforcing pattern of accelerating glacier loss that worries climate scientists.\n\nThis process mirrors other concerning planetary developments, such as how massive cosmic phenomena like approaching black holes capture scientific attention. While operating on vastly different scales, both represent profound forces reshaping their environments.\n\nRecent research indicates these algal blooms may become more frequent and intense as global temperatures rise. Scientists are now developing monitoring systems to track these blooms, similar to how advanced telescopes observe distant astronomical phenomena.\n\nThe wider implications for Earth’s climate future\n\nThe “bleeding glacier” phenomenon represents more than a localized issue – it symbolizes broader planetary changes. As these ancient ice formations disappear, sea levels rise, threatening coastal communities worldwide. Freshwater supplies diminish for regions dependent on glacial melt, potentially triggering resource conflicts.\n\nGlacier retreat also disrupts marine ecosystems by altering ocean temperatures and circulation patterns. These changes ripple throughout food webs, affecting species from microscopic plankton to apex predators. The rapid transformation of these environments recalls discoveries of ancient ocean ecosystems, like prehistoric deep-sea predators that dominated ancient oceans.\n\nScientists emphasize that this red warning sign demands immediate attention. By understanding these algal blooms and their relationship to climate change, researchers hope to develop strategies to mitigate their impact and preserve these critical ice formations for future generations."

            "description": "The Webb telescope has spotted exoplanets circling white dwarf stars, proving that planets can survive their star’s violent endgame.",
            "content": "Stellar corpses are supposed to cool, fade, and mind their own business. Yet a new climate‑modeling study hints that some of these faint objects – white dwarfs – could keep nearby planets toasty enough for liquid water to exist.\n\nThat possibility expands the hunting ground for habitable worlds by billions of targets and challenges the old idea that life can flourish only around stars that are very much alive.\n\nToday’s tools make that hunt more than wishful thinking. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has already glimpsed gas‑giant candidates circling white dwarfs, proving that planets can survive their star’s violent endgame.\n\nWith Webb’s infrared eyes, astronomers can now probe rocky worlds the size of Earth. That capability sets the stage for fresh computer experiments comparing two very different star systems.\n\nWhite dwarf corpses don’t chill out\n\nAfter a Sun‑like star sheds its outer layers, its core contracts into a white dwarf that is roughly as big as Earth but packs about half the Sun’s mass.\n\nCurrent models suggest the Milky Way hosts around 10 billion of these embers, and more than 97 percent of all stars will finish their lives the same way.\n\nAomawa Shields of the University of California, Irvine, and colleagues wondered whether such dim stars could light the way for life.\n\n“While white dwarf stars may still give off some heat from residual nuclear activity in their outer layers, they no longer exhibit nuclear fusion at their cores. For this reason, not much consideration has been given to these stars’ ability to host habitable exoplanets,” Shields explained.\n\n“Our computer simulations suggest that if rocky planets exist in their orbits, these planets could have more habitable real estate on their surfaces than previously thought.”\n\nTwo‑sun water world\n\nThe team used a three‑dimensional climate model that is normally used for Earth’s environment to compare the climates of two a hypothetical ocean‑covered planets with Earth‑like atmospheres. The two exoplanets were modeled to be in orbit around two different stars.\n\nOne exoplanet was placed in the so‑called habitable zone of a hypothetical 5,000 K white dwarf that has passed through most of its lifecycle and is on the slow path to stellar death.\n\nFor comparison, they placed the other exoplanet in the habitable zone around the main-sequence star known as Kepler‑62. This is a K-dwarf star that has an equivalent temperature to the white dwarf, but is still actively fusing hydrogen in its core. Kepler-62 is in a similar life stage as our Sun.\n\nBoth modeled planets were assumed to be tidally locked, with one hemisphere fixed in daylight and the other in eternal night. That configuration is common for worlds that hug close to small stars.\n\nDespite receiving the same amount of starlight overall, the climates of the two test exoplanets diverged in a surprising way.\n\nSpeed keeps white dwarfs warm\n\nThe white‑dwarf planet zips around its star every 10 hours. That tight orbit forces a 10‑hour day – much faster than Earth’s orbit, and far quicker than the 155‑day slog of its Kepler‑62 counterpart.\n\nRapid rotation whips up powerful winds that whisk heat from the day side to the night side and back again. Those winds also shear away the thick, reflective clouds that tend to gather over a slow‑spinning planet’s hot hemisphere.\n\nAs a result, the white‑dwarf world ran about 25 °C warmer at its surface than the planet orbiting Kepler‑62.\n\n“We expect synchronous rotation of an exoplanet in the habitable zone of a normal star like Kepler‑62 to create more cloud cover on the planet’s dayside, reflecting incoming radiation away from the planet’s surface,” Shields noted.\n\nThat’s usually a good thing for planets orbiting close to the inner edge of their stars’ habitable zones, where they could stand to cool off a bit rather than lose their oceans to space in a runaway greenhouse. But for a planet orbiting squarely in the middle of the habitable zone, it’s not such a good idea.\n\nClouds, winds, extra shoreline\n\nThe model showed that fewer dayside liquid‑water clouds let more sunlight stream down, while stronger greenhouse gases on the nightside trapped outgoing heat.\n\n“The planet orbiting Kepler‑62 has so much cloud cover that it cools off too much, sacrificing precious habitable surface area in the process,” Shields continued.\n\n“On the other hand, the planet orbiting the white dwarf is rotating so fast that it never has time to build up nearly as much cloud cover on its dayside, so it retains more heat, and that works in its favor.”\n\nTaken together, the temperature bump and the efficient heat circulation spread balmy conditions over a larger fraction of the white‑dwarf planet’s globe.\n\nThat result matters because real estate near the terminator – the ring of perpetual sunset between day and night – often offers the best prospects for life on tidally locked worlds.\n\nWider playground for planet hunters\n\nPlanets in orbit around dead stars are no longer hypothetical. In 2020, astronomers spotted WD 1856+534 b, a Jupiter‑sized object that circles its white dwarf host every 34 hours without being torn apart.\n\nIn 2024, the Webb telescope directly detected two more gas‑giant candidates orbiting separate white dwarfs, demonstrating Webb’s knack for sniffing out faint planets against dim stellar backgrounds.\n\n“These results suggest that the white dwarf stellar environment, once thought of as inhospitable to life, may present new avenues for exoplanet and astrobiology researchers to pursue,” Shields said.\n\nAs powerful observational capabilities to assess exoplanet atmospheres and astrobiology have come on line, such as those associated with the Webb telescope, we could be entering a new phase in which we’re studying an entirely new class of worlds around previously unconsidered stars.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nEvery white dwarf cools for billions of years, granting any close‑in planet a stable light source for far longer than the Sun’s remaining lifespan.\n\nWith ten billion of these stars scattered through our Milky Way galaxy, even a tiny fraction hosting temperate rocky worlds would translate into a staggering number of potential abodes.\n\nThe next step is clear: point Webb and its successors at the brightest white dwarfs, catch a transit, and read the atmospheric fingerprints. If the models are right, the ghostly glow of a dying star could someday soon reveal a living planet.\n\nThe full study was published in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

            "content": "Countless species of insects have been around for hundreds of millions of years, including pests like cockroaches and beetles. More specifically, the rove beetle (Staphylinidae) — which has over 66,000 species — dates as far back as dinosaurs. This beetle has learned to thrive by adapting to its environment and exploiting its prey. In fact, it’s even developed similar characteristics to other orders (like ants and mites) for its own survival.\n\nBut how, exactly, have these creatures developed and maintained these protective characteristics? A new study published in Cell found the answer to this question. Here’s the secret sauce fueling the rove beetle’s longevity.\n\nWhat Fuels the Rove Beetles’ Longevity?\n\nRove beetles have been around for over 100 million years. ©Henri Koskinen/Shutterstock.com\n\nScientists have officially discovered and analyzed the two cell types in the rove beetle’s tergal gland that produce protective repellants. Essentially, one cell creates a toxic chemical (like benzoquinone), while the other creates an activating liquid. Together, the two cells repel predators and protect the beetle from harm. This process is similar to how plants produce poisons as a protective mechanism.\n\n“The rove beetle tergal gland is this incredible, reprogrammable device for making new chemistries and evolving new interactions,” said Caltech biologist Joe Parker, a corresponding author of the study, in this article by Caltech. “It enabled these beetles to achieve extreme forms of ecological specialization. Without the gland, there would have been no getting into the weird and wonderful niches that these beetles have found themselves.”\n\nFor over 100 million years, the rove beetles’ gland chemistry has continued to adapt. In addition to repelling predators, these glands allow them to dominate new environments. For example, some of the species can mimic prey like mites and ants by producing similar chemicals. In many cases, rove beetles can infiltrate entire ant colonies via myrmecophily. Basically, these beetles are massive manipulators, convincing ants they are one of their own — all thanks to their tergal glands.\n\nWhat’s more? Once the beetles live alongside aggressive ant colonies, during evolution, many of them lose their glands and simply adapt to their co-inhabitants.\n\n“Apparently, once you have lived inside an army ant colony of millions of aggressive ants for long enough, you no longer need the gland,” explained postdoctoral scholar Sheila Kitchen, lead study author and an assistant professor at Texas A&M University, in the same Caltech article.\n\nThe rove beetle’s tergal gland is located at the tip of its abdomen. It’s also a prime example of macroevolution. The gland’s successful evolution is the driving force behind the insect’s diversification into over 66,000 species.\n\nHow Scientists Studied Rove Beetles’ Longevity\n\nThere are over 66,000 species of rove beetles — in large part thanks to their tergal glands. ©Sendo Serra/Shutterstock.com\n\nTo draw such remarkable conclusions, the scientists analyzed genomes across various beetle species. Through this research, they discovered that the rove beetle has maintained its tergal gland for over 100 million years. In fact, they traced the gland back to its development during the Early Cretaceous period.\n\nThe scientists also studied the evolution of two specific cell types in the tergal gland and their complex chemical defense system. They achieved this by “regramming” the cell types or tweaking the genes/gene functions. This helped them better understand the rove beetle’s chemical abilities and ecological specialization.\n\nThis research has allowed the study authors to identify similarities in the gland’s genetic architecture across various rove beetle species. Some of these ancient genes have repurposed themselves by adopting new functions to help the beetle survive and adapt to its environment. Additionally, some rove beetle species have even developed evolutionarily new genes to achieve these new protective functions. Coupled with their repurposed and entirely new genes/functions, it’s no wonder the rove beetle is so resilient.\n\nHow Are Rove Beetles Similar to Plants?\n\nMany types of plants, like poison ivy, produce toxic chemicals to protect themselves from predators. ©meunierd/Shutterstock.com\n\nAs mentioned earlier, similar to some plants, rove beetles can produce toxic chemicals that repel predators. According to the study published in Cell, scientists identified “molecular evolutionary steps leading to benzoquinone production by one cell type via a mechanism convergent with plant toxin release systems, and synthesis by the second cell type of a solvent that weaponizes the total secretion.” Together, the two cells have kept the rove beetle family alive and thriving for over 100 million years.\n\nMuch like plants, the rove beetle has developed these protective cellular functions—back by toxic chemicals—without harming or poisoning themselves. This allows them to defend themselves against predators without enduring negative consequences from their own toxins.\n\nThese plant-like abilities have helped the rove beetle to explode into over 66,000 species. Their powerful self-protective chemicals allow them to escape predators and manipulative prey. Not only is this a testament to their previous evolution but also to their continued evolvability."

It’s a snapshot of how your work continues to push the mission forward, every single day. Here’s some happenings from around the agency:\n\nAt Armstrong, engineers are conducting calibration flights for a new shock-sensing probe that will support future flight tests of the X-59 quiet supersonic demonstrator. Mounted on a research F-15D that will follow the X-59 closely in flight, the probe will gather data on the shock waves the X-59 generates, providing important data about its ability to fly faster than sound, but produce only a quiet thump.\n\nTeams began acceptance hot fire testing the first of three 12-kW Solar Electric Propulsion thrusters. Each thruster will operate for about 50 hours inside a NASA Glenn vacuum facility to ensure the hardware meets workmanship standards and performance requirements. The Advanced Electric Propulsion System thrusters will be critical to future exploration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\n\nAt NASA Kennedy, the team moved the interim cryogenic propulsion stage, which will propel Orion and the Artemis II crew around the Moon, to the Vehicle Assembly Building. Next, technicians will place the upper stage on top of the SLS (Space Launch System) core stage, paving the way for upcoming integrated testing.\n\nWe’re preparing to welcome NASA astronaut Don Pettit home on Saturday, April 19, concluding a seven-month science mission aboard the International Space Station. Don is scheduled to land in Kazakhstan at 9:20 p.m. EDT (6:20 a.m. Kazakhstan time, Sunday, April 20). Don also celebrates his 70th birthday on Sunday, April 20. Happy early birthday, Don!\n\nNASA premiered “Planetary Defenders,” a new documentary that follows the dedicated team behind asteroid detection and planetary defense. The film debuted at an event at Headquarters with digital creators, interagency and international partners, and now is streaming on NASA+, YouTube, and X. In its first 24 hours, it saw 25,000 views on YouTube – 75% above average – and reached 4 million impressions on X.\n\nEarlier this month, we launched the Efficiencies Ideas Submission form to hear directly from you – our workforce – on how we can make NASA more efficient at every level. To date, we have received more than 1,500 submissions from across the agency, offering a wide range of thoughtful, mission-focused ideas. Your input touched on everything from streamlining hiring and improving procurement, to modernizing our technology and improving knowledge and data management. On the mission front, suggestions included ideas on optimizing science missions and streamlining operations as well as accelerating technology development and focusing aeronautics research. These ideas reflect not only your deep expertise, but also your unwavering dedication to making NASA better. We’ll continue reviewing your suggestions and will share a summary of our findings and planned actions in the coming months.\n\nIn parallel, we’re also continuing to prepare our next response to the President’s Workforce Optimization Initiative for submission Monday. The response includes proposed organizational options to streamline and align our structure. The proposals are intended to provide a foundation for consideration by our future, confirmed administrator.\n\nAll of this work – whether it’s reviewing your ideas or streamlining our structure – points to the same goal: ensuring NASA remains ready and able to deliver on our mission, now and in the years ahead. Your insights, your commitment, and your continued focus on excellence are what make that possible.\n\nEmbrace the Challenge,\n\nJanet"

            "content": "For those of us whose memory of high school biology hasn't faded entirely, planarians will probably sound very familiar. They're generally used as an example of one of the extreme ends of regenerative capacity. While some animals like mammals have a limited ability to regenerate lost tissues, planarians can be cut roughly in half and regenerate either an entire head or entire tail, depending on which part of the body you choose to keep track of.\n\nIn doing so, they have to re-establish something that is typically only needed early in an animal's development: a signaling system that helps tell cells where the animal's head and tail are. Now, a US-based team asked a question that I'd never have thought of: What happens if you cut the animal in half early in development, while the developmental head-to-tail signaling system is still active? The answer turned out to be surprisingly complex.\n\nHeads or tails?\n\nPlanarians are small flatworms that would probably be living quiet lives somewhere if biologists hadn't discovered their ability to regenerate lots of adult tissues when damaged. The process has been well-studied by this point and involves the formation of a cluster of stem cells, called a blastema, at the site of damage. From there, many of the signals that control the formation of specialized tissues in the embryo get re-activated, directing the stem cells down the developmental pathways needed to reproduce any lost organs.\n\nCritical to this process is a signaling system that helps inform the animal of where its head is. Signaling molecules called wnts help developing embryos form what's called the anterior-posterior axis by telling the animal where its posterior resides. If it's needed, wnt signaling may also be reactivated during regeneration after the loss of major portions of the animal, inducing the blastema to form new tail structures. That reactivation takes place in the animal's muscle, which appears to be a key tissue in the process of sensing the damage and inducing regeneration.\n\nThe question being asked here is what happens if the damage that induces regeneration happens while the animal is still developing at a time when wnt signaling is normally patterning the animal's organs. To find out, the researchers started taking planarian embryos (from the species named Schmidtea polychroa) and slicing them in half."

            "content": "Astronomers may have just stumbled across a ghost galaxy hiding in plain sight — a small, starless, fast-moving cloud of gas that checks all the boxes for what’s known as a “dark galaxy.” And if the discovery holds up, it could help plug one of cosmology’s most puzzling holes: the mysterious “missing satellite” problem.\n\nThe team’s research, published today in Science Advances, describes AC G185.0–11.5, a compact hydrogen cloud tucked inside a larger high-velocity cloud (HVC) known as AC-I. The cloud was spotted by an international research team using China’s huge FAST radio telescope. While HVCs are known to zoom around at speeds beyond that of our Milky Way’s rotation, most are relatively featureless gas blobs. But the recently spotted gas cloud is different: it spins.\n\nFAST’s ultra-sensitive observations revealed a clear rotational pattern in the cloud, whose gas is arranged in a disk shape — the kind of structure you’d expect from a dwarf galaxy. But something’s amiss: there’s no sign of stars in the cloud, and no molecular gas (the usual star-forming stuff) to be found. AC G185.0–11.5 is apparently constituted of just hydrogen gas, swirling in space, with nothing within it lighting it up. Ergo, a dark galaxy.\n\nUsing galactic motion equations and a cosmic yardstick called the Tully-Fisher relation, the team estimated the cloud’s distance from Earth: about 278,000 light-years. That puts the cloud comfortably within the Local Group, our galactic neighborhood. As for mass, the cloud sits between 30 million and nearly 500 million Solar masses—not huge, but enough to be considered a galaxy in its own right.\n\nBut what gives AC G185.0–11.5 its nifty label of “dark galaxy” is its dark matter content. The researchers believe the cloud is held together by a massive dark matter halo, making it an ideal dark galaxy candidate — a theoretical type of galaxy made mostly of dark matter, with little or no visible stars.\n\nThis isn’t the first time scientists have suspected that some high-velocity clouds might actually be hidden galaxies, but most other candidates have lacked clear rotation or have been too difficult to distinguish from the Milky Way’s halo. AC G185.0–11.5 looks like the real deal — potentially the best evidence yet for a galaxy that’s all meat and no potatoes. You know, if potatoes were stars.\n\nIf the candidate dark galaxy is confirmed as such, it could rewrite how we think about galaxy formation. The cloud offers a tantalizing hint about where all the “missing” small galaxies might be hiding — not missing, just sitting lightless in plain sight."

            "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nFifty years since its discovery, scientists have finally worked out how a molecular machine found in mitochondria allows us to make the fuel we need from sugars, a process vital to all life on Earth.\n\nScientists at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Mitochondrial Biology Unit, University of Cambridge, have worked out the structure of this machine and shown how it operates like the lock on a canal to transport pyruvate—a molecule generated in the body from the breakdown of sugars—into our mitochondria.\n\nKnown as the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, this molecular machine was first proposed to exist in 1971, but it has taken until now for scientists to visualize its structure at the atomic scale using cryo-electron microscopy, a technique used to magnify an image of an object to around 165,000 times its real size. Details are published in Science Advances.\n\nDr. Sotiria Tavoulari, a Senior Research Associate from the University of Cambridge, who first determined the composition of this molecular machine, said, \"Sugars in our diet provide energy for our bodies to function. When they are broken down inside our cells they produce pyruvate, but to get the most out of this molecule it needs to be transferred inside the cell's powerhouses, the mitochondria. There, it helps increase 15-fold the energy produced in the form of the cellular fuel ATP.\"\n\nMaximilian Sichrovsky, a Ph.D. student at Hughes Hall and joint first author of the study, said, \"Getting pyruvate into our mitochondria sounds straightforward, but until now we haven't been able to understand the mechanism of how this process occurs.\n\n\"Using state-of-the-art cryo-electron microscopy, we've been able to show not only what this transporter looks like, but exactly how it works. It's an extremely important process, and understanding it could lead to new treatments for a range of different conditions.\"\n\nMitochondria are surrounded by two membranes. The outer one is porous, and pyruvate can easily pass through, but the inner membrane is impermeable to pyruvate. To transport pyruvate into the mitochondrion, first an outer \"gate\" of the carrier opens, allowing pyruvate to enter the carrier. This gate then closes, and the inner gate opens, allowing the molecule to pass through into the mitochondrion.\n\n\"It works like the locks on a canal but on the molecular scale,\" said Professor Edmund Kunji from the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit, and a Fellow at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. \"There, a gate opens at one end, allowing the boat to enter. It then closes and the gate at the opposite end opens to allow the boat smooth transit through.\"\n\nBecause of its central role in controlling the way mitochondria operate to produce energy, this carrier is now recognized as a promising drug target for a range of conditions, including diabetes, fatty liver disease, Parkinson's disease, specific cancers, and even hair loss.\n\nPyruvate is not the only energy source available. The body's cells can also take their energy from fats stored in the body or from amino acids in proteins. Blocking the pyruvate carrier would force the body to look elsewhere for its fuel—creating opportunities to treat a number of diseases.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter—daily or weekly.\n\nIn fatty liver disease, for example, blocking access to pyruvate entry into mitochondria could encourage the body to use potentially dangerous fat that has been stored in liver cells.\n\nLikewise, there are certain tumor cells that rely on pyruvate metabolism, such as in some types of prostate cancer. These cancers tend to be very \"hungry,\" producing excess pyruvate transport carriers to ensure they can feed more. Blocking the carrier could then starve these cancer cells of the energy they need to survive, killing them.\n\nPrevious studies have also suggested that inhibiting the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier may reverse hair loss. Activation of human follicle cells, which are responsible for hair growth, relies on metabolism and, in particular, the generation of lactate. When the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier is blocked from entering the mitochondria in these cells, it is instead converted to lactate.\n\nProfessor Kunji said, \"Drugs inhibiting the function of the carrier can remodel how mitochondria work, which can be beneficial in certain conditions. Electron microscopy allows us to visualize exactly how these drugs bind inside the carrier to jam it—a spanner in the works, you could say.\n\n\"This creates new opportunities for structure-based drug design in order to develop better, more targeted drugs. This will be a real game-changer.\"\n\nMore information: Maximilian Sichrovsky et al, Molecular basis of pyruvate transport and inhibition of the human mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, Science Advances (2025).

            "content": "In a study, scientists used a new way of displaying color imagery to push the boundaries of human vision.\n\nScientists have devised a method to hijack the human eye, enabling it to see brand-new colors that lie beyond the scope of natural human vision.\n\nWith this technique, the researchers enabled five people to see a new color, dubbed \"olo,\" which the study participants described as a \"blue-green of unprecedented saturation.\" The researchers, some of whom participated in the experiment themselves, described their technique and the new color in a study published Friday (April 18) in the journal Science Advances .\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to provide programmable control over every photoreceptor [light-sensing cell] in the retina,\" primarily for research purposes, said co-first author James Fong , a doctoral student in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Although this has not been achieved to that level, the method we present in the current study demonstrates that a lot of the key principles are possible in practice,\" Fong told Live Science in an email.\n\nControlling the retina at this granular level could open up new ways of studying vision, the researchers said. For instance, scientists could use the system to replicate the effects of different eye diseases to better understand the vision loss they trigger. In theory, the technique could also be used to simulate full-color vision in people who are color-blind, essentially compensating for their missing or defective photoreceptors.\n\nBy using the system to introduce the brain to new visual data and patterns of retina stimulation, in theory, \"it may be possible that this [color-blind] person would learn to see the new dimension of color,\" Fong suggested.\n\nRelated: This optical illusion tricks you into seeing different colors. How does it work?\n\nJourney to Oz\n\nHuman eyes contain light-sensitive cells, called photoreceptors, which come in two forms: rods and cones. Rods enable night vision, as they respond to relatively low levels of photons, or packets of electromagnetic radiation .\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

These three types of cones are respectively named \"L,\" \"M\" and \"S,\" in reference to the long, medium and short wavelengths of the visible spectrum to which they are most sensitive.\n\nOnce cones are activated, color vision relies on the brain to interpret the activation patterns of these three types of cells across the retina. Each pattern acts like a code, with different codes unlocking different perceptions of colors and intensities of light.\n\nM cones are most sensitive to green, but technically, they respond to a whole spectrum of colors that completely overlaps with the wavelengths L and S cones react to. As such, in natural conditions, you can't activate M cones without also activating L and S cones. The scientists wondered what would happen if you could defy that rule and exclusively activate M cones.\n\nThis chart demonstrates how, in natural settings, the activation of M cones also comes with activation of S and L cones. In the new study, the researchers activated M in isolation. (Image credit: By BenRG - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7873848)\n\n\"We originally started this project specifically to study M cone stimulation,\" Fong said. \"But it quickly became clear to us that [the] required underlying technology would be broadly useful to study visual function at a new level of scale and precision.\"\n\nThey named their resulting retinal stimulation technique \"Oz,\" in homage to the green-tinted glasses that people in the Emerald City wear in the original \"Wizard of Oz\" books. The approach requires a detailed map of each user's retina. To create such a map, the researchers started by taking multiple videos of the retina and stitching them together to capture what the tissue looked like.\n\nFrom there, the L, M and S cones were labeled; the locations of these cells are unique in each person's retina, Fong noted. To reveal each cone's identity, the researchers used a technique called adaptive optics optical coherence tomography (AO-OCT), which involved shining light on the cells and measuring how they changed shape; this response differs depending on which wavelengths a cone is sensitive to.\n\nWith a detailed retinal map, the team then ran their experiments. Each participant sat in front of a display with a small square at its center, where the Oz stimulation unfolded. The stimulation targeted specific types of cones with visible-wavelength laser light, called laser microdoses. So, to switch on only M cones, the system targeted only those cells with lasers.\n\nThe scientists also used a real-time feed of the eye during the experiment, and the approach accounted for the eye's subtle motion, to ensure the lasers hit their targets.\n\nRevealing a new color\n\nStimulating only M cones revealed the color olo, whose name refers to coordinates on a 3D map of color — \"0, 1, 0.\" The \"o\" is a zero, referencing the lack of stimulation of L and S cones, while the \"l\" is a 1, indicating full stimulation of M cones. After stimulating olo in isolation, the scientists were also able to incorporate the color into images and videos viewed by the participants.\n\nOne way to imagine olo is to think of the light from a green laser pointer and then turn up the saturation. In comparison with olo, monochromatic laser light looks \"pale,\" some of the participants said. \"It is very foreign to me to imagine how something else could be saturated enough to where the laser starts looking pale in comparison,\" Fong said.\n\nAlthough Oz can already push the boundaries of human vision, it does have some limitations in its current setup.\n\nFor instance, participants cannot look directly at the Oz display, Fong noted, because the cones at the very center of the retina are very small, making it difficult to localize the laser light. Because of this, people in the study viewed Oz with their peripheral vision by looking at a fixed point slightly away from the square.\n\nEventually, Oz could potentially be applied on the fovea — the central part of the retina that enables super-sharp vision — but \"it will be a significant challenge in practice,\" Fong said.\n\nAnother limitation is that, currently, users must fix their gaze in one spot to use Oz, because the scientists mapped only a small portion of the retina containing thousands of cones, as a proof of concept. Allowing people to shift their gaze freely would introduce \"substantial technical challenges,\" the authors wrote in their paper. That's because more of the retina would need to be mapped and the method for delivering microdoses would need to be extraordinarily precise in tracking eye movement.\n\nThe scientists are now exploring the idea of using Oz to study and treat color blindness, as well as to stimulate the experience of having a fourth type of cone cell. This occurs naturally in some people and results in a rare ability called tetrachromacy , which boosts their sensitivity to color. The team is also using Oz to model various eye diseases.\n\nOutside of scientific research, Oz could theoretically be used for everyday color displays, like those in your television or phone screen — but that application seems very unlikely, Fong said.\n\n\"Our current method depends on highly specialized lasers and optics that are definitely not coming to smartphones or TVs any time soon,\" he said. So, for now, olo will remain a rare color seen by only a few."

Discovering a galaxy without dark matter is indeed perplexing, like finding a shadow without a source.\n\nYet, over the past decade, several such sightings have been reported — all of them so-called \"ultradiffuse galaxies,\" which are about the size of our own Milky Way but remarkably sparse in stars.\n\nThe latest member of this puzzling collection, known as FCC 224, resides on the fringes of the Fornax Cluster, a collection of galaxies that lies roughly 65 million light-years from Earth.\n\nRelated: What is dark matter?\n\nFirst spotted in 2024 , FCC 224 is a dwarf galaxy that boasts a dozen luminous, tightly bound clusters of stars — an unusually rich population for its size, typically seen in larger, dark-matter rich galaxies — yet appears to lack the mysterious substance. It also occupies a distinctly different cosmic neighborhood than other galaxies that are deficient in dark matter, suggesting such objects might not be isolated flukes but rather represent a more common, previously unrecognized class of dwarf galaxies, according to two complementary papers published last month.\n\n\"No existing galaxy formation model within our standard cosmological paradigm can currently explain how this galaxy came to be,\" Maria Buzzo, a doctoral candidate in astrophysics at the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia who led one of the new studies , said in a statement .\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nUsing data from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, Buzzo and her team tracked the movement of a dozen star clusters within FCC 224. These measurements revealed a slow speed among the clusters, a key indicator that the galaxy lacks the strong gravitational pull expected from dark matter, the new study reports. No known scenario can fully explain FCC 224's properties, the researchers say.\n\nAnother team, led by astronomer Yimeng Tang at the University of California, Santa Cruz, compared FCC 224's properties to other galaxies that seemingly lack dark matter, focusing on two ghostly objects within the NGC 1052 group about 65 million light-years away in the constellation Cetus.\n\nTang and his colleagues propose that FCC 224, like those NGC 1052 dwarf galaxies, formed from a high-velocity collision of gas-rich galaxies. In such an event, the gas separates from the dark matter, and subsequent star formation in the expelled gas forms one or more dark-matter-free galaxies.\n\nPrevious research found that the two galaxies in the NGC 1052 group, DF2 and DF4, belong to a trail of seven to 11 dark-matter-deficient galaxies that formed in the same ancient collision. FCC 224 likely has a twin galaxy, too, Tang and his team suggest in their study .\n\nOne candidate is the nearby galaxy FCC 240, which appears to have the same size, shape and orientation as FCC 224. If forthcoming observations confirm the shared properties, it would provide crucial evidence supporting the collision scenario for the formation of FCC 224, the researchers say.\n\nAlternatively, FCC 224 could be the result of a chaotic, high-energy environment where intense star formation from overmassive star clusters expelled dark matter from the galaxy, the team suggests.\n\n\"FCC 224 serves as a crucial data point in our effort to identify and study other dark-matter-deficient galaxies,\" Buzzo said in the statement. \"By expanding the sample size, we can refine our understanding of these rare galaxies and of the role of dark matter in dwarf galaxy formation.\""

            "content": "Mars has not always been a seemingly lifeless red desert. We have evidence that billions of years ago it had a warm, habitable climate with liquid water in lakes and flowing rivers, which is somewhat confusing, given that Mars is much farther from the Sun than the Earth and that the Sun was much less bright back then. “In order for Mars to be warm enough to host liquid water, there must have been a lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,” says Benjamin Tutolo, a researcher at the University of Calgary. “The question we’ve been asking for at least 30 years was where the record of all this carbon is.”\n\nTutolo led a new study of rock samples collected by the Curiosity rover that might have answered this question.\n\nThe tallest sediment stack\n\nThe mystery of Mars’ missing carbon stems from two seemingly conflicting results. On the one hand, we have already found dried riverbeds and lakes on the surface of Mars, so we know there must have been liquid water on its surface at some point. To account for the presence of this water, every Martian climate model we have run indicates that huge amounts of atmospheric carbon were needed to provide a sufficient greenhouse effect to keep the surface temperature above freezing. But the data we were getting from satellite observations of Mars found much less carbon in the Martian soil than those climate models would suggest. “So, either the models were incorrect—and there’s no good reason to believe that—or there really was lots of carbon in the Martian atmosphere,” Tutolo says.\n\nThe only way to resolve that mystery was to put boots on the ground and look for that carbon. Or wheels.\n\nCuriosity rover was called Mars Science Laboratory for a reason. It went to the red planet fitted with a suite of instruments, some of which even the newer Perseverance was lacking. These enabled it to analyze the collected Martian rocks on the spot and beam the results back to Earth. “To get the most bang for the buck, NASA decided to send it to the place on Mars called the Gale Crater, because it was the tallest stack of sediments on the planet,” Tutolo says. The central peak of Gale Crater was about 5 kilometers tall, created by the ancient meteorite impact."

            "content": "Paleontologists have identified a gigantic apex predator that once roamed Central Asia and towered over early tyrannosaurs—offering a glimpse into a forgotten age of prehistoric giants.\n\nThe newly described species, Ulughbegsaurus uzbekistanensis, was discovered in the Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan and dates back to approximately 90 million years ago, during the early Late Cretaceous period.\n\nAccording to a 2021 study published in Royal Society Open Science, Ulughbegsaurus was part of the Carcharodontosauria family—a group of massive predatory theropods that predated and once dominated ecosystems before the rise of tyrannosaurids.\n\nThe fossil, identified from a large upper jawbone, reveals a creature estimated to be 7.5 to 8 meters long (about 26 feet) and weighing over 1,000 kilograms—placing it well above its contemporary tyrannosauroids in size and power.\n\nA Colossal Predator Among Giants\n\nThe fossil record of the region had long puzzled paleontologists. Although numerous species of smaller carnivorous dinosaurs, including tyrannosauroids, had been unearthed, the absence of a top predator had left a gap in the ecological puzzle—until now.\n\n“The apex predator was missing from the species, and now here it is,” said Dr. Darla Zelenitsky, one of the study’s lead authors. “It’s surprising it took this long to identify such a large predator.”\n\nUlughbegsaurus filled that apex role with ease. It possessed powerful jaws and slashing teeth adapted for tearing flesh rather than crushing bone—a stark contrast to the later, more robust T. rex.\n\nAccording to Zelenitsky, the difference in size between Ulughbegsaurus and early tyrannosaurs was like “a grizzly bear standing beside a coyote.” She noted that “Ulughbegsaurus was the dominant apex predator of its time.”\n\nLeft maxilla of Ulughbegsaurus uzbekistanensis. Image credit: Kohei et al., doi: 10.1098/rsos.210923.\n\nTyrannosaurs Held Down by Bigger Rivals\n\nThe ecosystem of the Late Cretaceous wasn’t always ruled by tyrannosaurs. In fact, early tyrannosauroids like Timurlengia, which lived alongside Ulughbegsaurus, were much smaller—measuring just 3 to 4 meters (10 to 13 feet) in length and weighing roughly 170 kilograms. These early forms were likely mesopredators, feeding on smaller prey and avoiding direct conflict with much larger competitors.\n\nAs Zelenitsky explained, “They likely kept the tyrannosaurus down,” referring to how dominant apex predators like Ulughbegsaurus may have prevented tyrannosaurs from growing into their later, monstrous proportions. It wasn’t until after the extinction of these carcharodontosaurians that tyrannosaurids had the ecological space to evolve into giants like Tyrannosaurus rex.\n\nA Disappearance That Reshaped Evolution\n\nUlughbegsaurus’s reign came to an end near the end of the Turonian age, around 89 million years ago. What exactly led to its extinction remains uncertain, but environmental upheavals or shifts in prey availability may have played a role.\n\n“The extinction of Ulughbegasaurus may have been driven by changes in prey or environmental conditions,” Zelenitsky said.\n\nIts disappearance marked a turning point in dinosaur evolution. With these apex predators gone, the ecological vacuum allowed tyrannosaurs to begin their ascent—eventually dominating Late Cretaceous food chains across North America and Asia."

            "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen a new comet appears in the sky, there is often excitement. But things don’t always end well for the ancient celestial objects, made of ice, frozen gases and rock, as they near the sun — and an untimely demise appears to hold true for Comet C/2025 F2 (SWAN).\n\nAll signs suggest that the celestial object, which resembled a fuzzy green patch, has disintegrated in the last couple days, said Qicheng Zang, a postdoctoral fellow studying small body astronomy at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona.\n\nThe latest ground-based observations from telescopes do seem to imply the comet has fallen apart, said Dr. Karl Battams, a computational scientist within the Solar and Heliospheric Physics Branch at the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC.\n\nAdditional observations will help confirm whether disintegration is the true cause of the comet’s apparent outburst and dimming.\n\n“There’s a remnant dust cloud that should continue to be telescopically visible for a few more weeks, but it’s spreading out and fading,” Zang said.\n\nSky-gazers in the Northern Hemisphere can see the comet’s remnant in the early morning.\n\nPrior to the disintegration, part of the hype around the comet was the fact that it was only recently discovered, and the comet’s closest pass of the sun on May 1 would present a once-in-a-lifetime viewing opportunity, likely not reappearing for hundreds of thousands of years — or leaving the solar system all together.\n\nNow, sky-gazers can essentially see the comet remnant’s final passage.\n\nThe object takes its name from the Solar Wind ANisotropies, or SWAN, instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO, spacecraft, a joint project of the European Space Agency and NASA. Amateur astronomers Vladimir Bezugly from Ukraine, Michael Mattiazzo in Australia and US-based Rob Matson each independently spotted and reported the object, known as Comet SWAN or SWAN25F, while looking through images taken by the SWAN instrument at the end of March. The Minor Planet Center officially designated it as C/2025 F2 (SWAN) on April 8.\n\nThe three astronomers “noticed a faint smudge, indicative of a comet, that seemed to move across the sky over a period of a few days.”\n\n“Since no comet was known to be in that part of the sky at that time, they correctly assumed it to be a new discovery,” Battams said.\n\nBattams is also principal investigator for the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph instrument suite, a set of three telescopes on the SOHO spacecraft that takes images of the sun’s atmosphere.\n\nBattams recommends looking “low to the northeast horizon an hour or two before dawn” to see the remnant.\n\nA NASA animation depicts how comets orbit the sun and how the sun's heat causes a \"tail\" to form behind a comet. NASA Jet Propulsion Lab\n\n“It will only be visible from the northern hemisphere until very early May, and then will gradually rise in the southern hemisphere skies,” Battams said in an email.\n\nJust remember to look low toward the horizon, rather than high in the sky, to see it.\n\nThe fragmenting of a comet\n\nSome reports had shown that the comet’s initial brightness faded slightly within the last few days, Battams said.\n\nNow, astronomers recognize that this slight dimming was likely a sign of the comet’s fate.\n\n“It’s now likely the surge in brightness after the comet was discovered was actually the comet beginning to disintegrate,” Zang said in an email. “When they initially break apart, it exposes all the ice in its interior to the Sun, causing them to turn to gas (which we saw as the green glow that made the comet bright) all at once.”\n\nAs the ice runs out, gas gradually stops being released, and the comet dims, he said.\n\n“It looks like we’re now pretty much at the point where the ice/gas is just about all gone, so all that’s left is the dust.”\n\nAstronomers suspect the comet came from the Oort Cloud, a reservoir of icy bodies thought to exist at the edge of our solar system far from the warm reach of the sun.\n\n“Every now and then, an Oort Cloud comet will get gravitationally ‘nudged’ out of this reservoir and will begin to fall in towards the Sun,” Battams said in an email. “We think this comet has been heading inwards for about 35,000 years, although it’s difficult to be too precise about those numbers.”\n\nEarthSky has reported that recent observations suggest the comet completes one orbit around the sun every 2.1 million years.\n\nAs comets approach the sun, our star’s heat causes them to release gas and dust, which provide their signature tails.\n\nBigger comets, which are heavier, don’t tend to disintegrate as they near the sun. But it’s more common for smaller comets because as they release their gases, the celestial objects spin rapidly until they fly apart, Zang said.\n\n“The extreme solar radiation was more than this comet could handle,” Battams said. “Scientists are still trying to work out the specifics of what drives fragmentation like this. It is almost certainly a combination of factors or processes, but fundamentally it’s all due to a comet with a very volatile surface/composition getting too close to the Sun. It is definitely not uncommon, and I’m honestly not at all surprised this one in particular appears to be doing so.”\n\nLast October, the “Halloween comet” disintegrated during its closest approach of the sun.\n\nThe object, also known as Comet C/2024 S1 (ATLAS), was discovered on September 27 and quickly earned its nickname following speculation that it might be visible in the night sky near the end of October. But as the comet neared the sun, it broke apart into chunks until it finally evaporated, according to NASA.\n\nC/2024 S1 was a sungrazer, a comet that passes within a distance of about 850,000 miles (1,367,942 kilometers) from the sun. Sungrazers often vaporize due to the intense, hot solar atmosphere.\n\nComet C/2025 F2 (SWAN) was expected to pass within 31 million miles (50 million kilometers) of the sun in May.\n\nHow to spot the fragment\n\nThe remnant will appear within the constellation Andromeda in the northeastern sky a couple of hours or so before sunrise, Zang said. Then, the dust cloud will reappear in the night sky toward the end of April. A new moon on the evening of April 27 will make the comet easier to see.\n\nThe remnant will be easier for those in the Southern Hemisphere to see in May, according to The Planetary Society.\n\nThe celestial object will appear near the constellation Taurus above the western horizon after sunset and appear higher in the sky each night in May.\n\nDiscovering a new comet\n\nThe SWAN instrument wasn’t designed to pick out comets in the night sky, but it has contributed to the discovery of 16 comets to date, Zang said.\n\n“It’s a unique instrument designed to map out hydrogen in our solar system by looking at a certain type of light that gets scattered by neutral hydrogen atoms,” Battams said in an email. “But comets happen to be a very rich source of hydrogen — primarily by water of water-ice being vaporized by the Sun — and so they often glow quite brightly in the SWAN images.”\n\nAnother observation of the comet was made on April 11 by the Virtual Telescope Project. Gianluca Masi/Virtual Telescope Project.\n\nZang first observed the comet on the morning of April 2 and has seen it twice since then. He took images of the part of the sky where the comet was said to be, based on coordinates shared by those who found it using the SWAN data, and spotted the celestial object.\n\nBattams said that Zang was the first to observe it from the ground after the amateur astronomers made the SWAN discovery, and his observations were crucial for allowing other astronomers to point their telescopes at the correct location.\n\nAstronomer Gianluca Masi also observed the comet twice using a telescope in Manciano, Italy. Masi runs The Virtual Telescope Project, which offers views from remotely controlled robotic telescopes online.\n\nCNN’s Taylor Nicoli contributed to this report."

Credit: NASA\n\nFor scientists who want to learn about the geological history of a planet, river deltas are a great place to start. Deltas gather sediment from a large area into one place, which can be studied to reveal climate and tectonic histories or signs of past life. That's why NASA sent its most recent Mars rover to Jezero Crater, home to a prominent and well-preserved delta.\n\nAnd that's why planetary scientists are also interested in finding deltas on Saturn's moon Titan. Titan is the only planetary body in the solar system besides Earth that has liquid currently flowing across its surface, so its deltas could be a scientific treasure trove.\n\nOne problem: Titan appears to be largely devoid of deltas, a new study finds, despite its large rivers of liquid methane and ethane.\n\n\"It's kind of disappointing as a geomorphologist because deltas should preserve so much of Titan's history,\" said Sam Birch, an assistant professor in Brown University's Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences who led the work.\n\nBut the absence of deltas raises a host of new questions.\n\n\"We take it for granted that if you have rivers and sediments, you get deltas,\" Birch said. \"But Titan is weird. It's a playground for studying processes we thought we understood.\"\n\nTitan is the largest of Saturn's 274 confirmed moons. Its thick nitrogen and methane atmosphere gives rise to a host of Earth-like climate and weather features. Titan has clouds, wind and rain as well as rivers, lakes and seas. But instead of water, Titan's fluid bodies contain methane and ethane, which are liquid at Titan's chilly surface temperatures.\n\nScientists learned of Titan's liquid bodies when the Cassini spacecraft flew by in 2006. Peering through Titan's thick atmosphere with Cassini's synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the spacecraft revealed spidering channels and large flat areas consistent with large bodies of liquid.\n\nLargely missing from Cassini's SAR images, however, were deltas—even at the mouths of large rivers. It wasn't clear, however, whether the deltas were truly absent, or whether they just didn't show up in Cassini's SAR data. That's the question Birch and his colleagues tried to answer with this new study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets.\n\nEarth, as seen by Cassini's radar. In order to understand what landforms on Titan could be seen by Cassini's radar, researchers looked at well-known Earth landforms through Cassini's perspective.

So while the SAR images could see the broad seas and river channels, it's harder to confidently make out coastal features because it's difficult to see where the coast ends and where the sea floor begins.\n\nFor the study, Birch developed a numerical model to simulate what Cassini's SAR would see if it looked at a landscape scientists understand well: Earth. In the model, the water in Earth's rivers and oceans was replaced by Titan's methane liquid, which has different radar absorption properties compared to water.\n\n\"We basically made synthetic SAR images of Earth that assume properties of Titan's liquid instead of Earth's,\" Birch said. \"Once we see SAR images of a landscape we know very well, we can go back to Titan and understand a bit better what we're looking at.\"\n\nThe research found that the synthetic SAR images of Earth clearly resolved large deltas and many other large coastal landscapes.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Aside from two probable deltas near Titan's south pole, the rest of the moon's rivers were entirely delta-free. The researchers found that only about 1.3% of Titan's large rivers that terminate at coastlines have deltas. On Earth, in contrast, nearly every river of similar size has a delta.\n\nIt's not entirely clear why Titan generally lacks deltas, Birch says. The fluid properties of Titan's rivers should make them perfectly capable of carrying and depositing sediment. It could be, the researchers say, that sea levels on Titan rise and fall so rapidly that deltas are smeared across the landscape more quickly than they can be built up in a single spot. Winds and tidal currents along Titan's coasts may also play an equally large role in preventing delta formation.\n\nAnd missing deltas aren't the only mystery raised by the new research. The new analysis of Cassini SAR data of Titan's coasts revealed pits of unknown origin deep within lakes and seas. The study also found deep channels on the floors of the seas that seem to have been carved by river flows, but it's not clear how they got there.\n\nAll of these surprises will require more research to fully understand, Birch says.\n\n\"This is really not what we expected,\" Birch said. \"But Titan does this to us a lot. I think that's what makes it such an engaging place to study.\"\n\nMore information: S. P. D.

            "content": "NASA’s Perseverance rover has made a mysterious discovery during its exploration of Jezero Crater: a dark-colored stone with unusual features that “may have originated from elsewhere.”\n\nThe unexpected discovery, which the Perseverance team has dubbed “Skull Hill,” was made last week while the intrepid rover continued its descent down the lower part of Witch Hazel Hill along the crater’s rim.\n\nAt one point, the rover stopped at the boundary between a pair of distinct rock outcrops of contrasting coloration that were first revealed in orbital imagery of the crater. The intriguing location, which the Perseverance team had nicknamed “Port Anson,” appears to be a geological “contact” area featuring several intriguing angular rocks, some of which are believed to have originated someplace other than their current resting place.\n\nSuch “float” rocks, as scientists call these out-of-place stones, are not uncommon on the Red Planet. However, even in an area rich with such features, Skull Hill stands out as a curious sample of stone that has left NASA’s scientific team with many questions.\n\nA Closer Look at “Skull Hill”\n\nA dark-toned rock formation possessing a rugged, angular surface and several unusual pit-like markings, Skull Hill was discovered on April 11 by the rover’s Mastcam-Z instrument. The curious looking stone contrasts sharply against the lighter terrain surrounding it, primarily due to its chalky grey color and unusual pits, which the Perseverance team believes are likely the result of wind erosion over long periods.\n\nAnother reason for the rock’s strange, pitted appearance could involve the presence of clasts that were once embedded in it, which weathered away over time. Although Skull Hill is certainly an outlier among the local surrounding Martian rock samples, similar dark-colored float rocks have been discovered in the Port Anson area in the past.\n\nOngoing investigation into these unusual stones could help to determine not only their origins, but also the transport mechanisms behind their movement from their original location on the Red Planet’s surface.\n\nHowever, adding to the mystery is another intriguing possibility the Perseverance team considered: that Skull Hill might not originate from anywhere on Mars at all.\n\nMeteorite or Magmatic Mystery?\n\nBased on the stone’s dark coloration and unusual shape, one possibility that was initially considered had been that Skull Hill might be a fragment from a meteorite that made its way to the Martian surface.\n\nAlthough the stone’s appearance does superficially resemble a meteorite, chemical analysis of the sample made possible by Perseverance’s SuperCam instrument indicates a composition that likely rules out a meteorite origin.\n\nBut if not a meteorite, then what could account for Skull Hill’s unusual appearance?\n\nThe best explanation so far seems to be that the mysterious stone is an igneous rock, which likely formed as molten lava or magma cooled long ago in the Red Planet’s history. Such volcanic stones are common both on Mars, and on Earth, and contain an abundance of elements like iron and magnesium which would contribute to their dark color.\n\nOther minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite—all of which are frequently found in igneous rocks—might also be present in Skull Hill.\n\nFurther investigations by Perseverance will likely help to shed additional light on the mystery.\n\n“Luckily for us, the rover has instruments that can measure the chemical composition of rocks on Mars,” said Margaret Deahn, Ph.D., a student at Purdue University who wrote about the recent discovery in a blog post at NASA’s website.\n\n“Understanding the composition of these darker-toned floats will help the team to interpret the origin of this unique rock,” Deahn added. By analyzing the composition of dark-toned float rocks like Skull Hill, the team hopes to trace their geologic story—whether shaped by volcanic activity, impact events, or something entirely unexpected.\n\nAdditional information about “Skull Hill” and Perseverance’s latest investigations can be found on NASA’s official blogs webpage.\n\nMicah Hanks is the Editor-in-Chief and Co-Founder of The Debrief.

            "content": "Check out the vibrant first photo from PUNCH, a NASA mission that is hitting the ground running with some neat shots of the Sun.\n\nPUNCH—short for the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere—launched into low-Earth orbit last month, and its just taken its first images in what will hopefully be a fruitful period of scientific discovery.\n\nPUNCH consists of four satellites orbiting each other in a constellation. The suitcase-sized instruments together comprise one, 8,000-mile-wide (12,900-kilometer-wide) space weather detector. PUNCH is charged with observing how the solar corona gives way to solar wind, the energetically charged particles from the Sun that cause auroras here on Earth.\n\nAfter spending a few weeks getting their gear sorted, all four satellites have now opened their imaging doors. “All four instruments are functioning as designed,” said Craig DeForest, the mission’s principal investigator, in a Southwest Research Institute release. “We’re excited to finish on-orbit commissioning and get these cameras working together.”\n\nPUNCH’s cameras—its coronagraph and imagers—are designed to observe the faintest edges of the solar corona and the solar wind, features on the periphery of our host star that are extremely difficult to spot given the Sun’s brightness.\n\nThe solar wind streams out of the Sun at more than one million miles per hour (1.61 million kilometers per hour), and its features are less than 0.1% as bright as the Milky Way. In its imaging process, PUNCH has to remove the light of distant stars, light reflecting off interplanetary dust, and your standard digital noise.\n\nBut that’s not all, folks. PUNCH’s rocket engines are the size of shot glasses and water-powered. The engines’ diminutive size is just enough to give PUNCH a kick of an inch per second (two centimeters per second), which is all the mission needs to keep the constellation in stable orbit.\n\n“PUNCH is the first space mission to rely on this type of engine, which carries safe, inert, non-toxic propellant,” DeForest said. “That safety and stability are worth it even though the thrusters are more complex than conventional hydrazine rockets.”\n\nThis is merely the preamble to PUNCH’s big show. The spacecrafts are currently undergoing a 90-day commissioning period, and the science mission won’t begin until June. But the current steps are crucial for the team to ensure that PUNCH properly filters out all the light that would otherwise jeopardize its observation of the solar wind. The pleasantly soft glow in the top image—first light for the nascent spacecraft—is light glinting off the dust particles around the Sun.\n\nPUNCH will help researchers stay prepared for solar wind—and solar storms—that blow energetic particles at our planet. Those storms can interfere with electronics on Earth, including the power grid, making it critical that scientists are kept up to date on the latest dynamics from the surface of our star."

            "content": "In a demonstration of nature’s raw power, a new island has emerged from the Red Sea. This natural phenomenon, triggered by volcanic activity, has left scientists and onlookers alike in awe. The formation of this island provides a rare glimpse into the dynamic forces that shape our planet, particularly in the volatile regions where tectonic plates meet.\n\nA Volcanic Eruption That Created a New World\n\nThe island’s formation began with an eruption of volcanic activity in the Red Sea, specifically in the Zubair archipelago, near Yemen. This eruption is part of a much larger and ongoing geological event taking place in the region, where the African and Arabian tectonic plates are slowly pulling apart. As these plates separate, new oceanic crust is regularly created, and this time, it resulted in the creation of a new landmass.\n\nThe Birth of an Island\n\nThe eruption that led to this island’s formation was first observed by fishermen in the area on December 19, 2023. They witnessed lava shooting 30 meters into the air, an extraordinary sight that soon caught the attention of satellite monitoring systems.\n\nNASA’s Earth Observing One satellite captured images of the event, and elevated sulfur dioxide levels in the air were recorded by NASA’s Aura satellite. By December 23, just four days later, the eruption had created a solidified mass of lava that broke through the ocean’s surface.\n\nThe new island, roughly 500 meters wide, began to take shape as the lava continued its cooling and solidifying process. The island’s future remains uncertain. Will it grow larger, or will it succumb to the harsh waves of the Red Sea?\n\nThe Red Sea Rift: A Natural Wonder\n\nThe phenomenon of new island formation in the Red Sea is not an isolated incident. The region sits on what is known as the Red Sea Rift, where the tectonic plates of Africa and Arabia are slowly moving apart.\n\nThis rift is a hotspot for geological activity, regularly generating new crust and occasionally resulting in the birth of new islands. The formation of this island serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing changes beneath the Earth’s surface.\n\nThe Red Sea: A Hotspot for Geological Activity\n\nAt this point, it is still unclear whether this new island will remain or disappear. While its creation is a spectacle of nature’s strength, it is not guaranteed to endure. The surrounding waters of the Red Sea are notorious for their wave action, which may eventually erode the island. Alternatively, continued volcanic activity could allow it to grow, potentially becoming a permanent feature of the Zubair archipelago.\n\nAs of now, the island is still in its infancy, but its presence raises interesting questions about the future of the Red Sea region. Could more islands form as the tectonic plates continue to shift? Will the region’s volcanic activity intensify in the coming years? These are just a few of the questions scientists will undoubtedly be investigating as they monitor the ongoing eruption and the island’s development."

The close approaches should help scientists better understand our early solar system when planets were forming; asteroids are the ancient leftovers.\n\nThe upcoming flyby is a dress rehearsal for 2027 when Lucy reaches its first so-called Trojan asteroid near Jupiter.\n\nCranking up its three science instruments, the spacecraft on Sunday will observe the harmless asteroid known as Donaldjohanson. The encounter will take place 139 million miles (223 million kilometers) from Earth in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, so far away it will take 12 minutes for each bit of data to reach flight controllers in Colorado.\n\nThe paleontologist for whom the asteroid is named plans to be at spacecraft builder and operator Lockheed Martin’s Mission Control for all the action. He discovered the fossil Lucy in Ethiopia 50 years ago; the spacecraft is named after the famous human ancestor.\n\nNASA’s Lucy will venture as close as 596 miles (960 kilometers) to this asteroid, an estimated 2 ½ miles (4 kilometers) in length but much shorter in width. Scientists should have a better idea of its size and shape following the brief visit. The spacecraft will zoom by at more than 30,000 mph (48,000 kph).\n\nThe asteroid is among countless fragments believed to have resulted from a major collision 150 million years ago.\n\n“It’s not going to be a basic potato. We already know that,” said lead scientist Hal Levison of Southwest Research Institute.\n\nRather, Levison said the asteroid may resemble a bowling pin or even a snowman like Arrokoth, the Kuiper Belt object visited by NASA’s New Horizon spacecraft in 2019. The other possibility is that there are two elongated but separate asteroids far apart.\n\n“We don’t know what to expect. That’s what makes this so cool,” he said.\n\nThere will be no communications with Lucy during the flyby as the spacecraft turns its antenna away from Earth in order to track the asteroid. Levison expects to have most of the science data within a day.\n\nLucy’s next stop — “the main event,” as Levison calls it — will be the Trojan asteroids that share Jupiter’s orbit around the sun. Swarms of Trojans precede and follow the solar system’s largest planet as it circles the sun. Lucy will visit eight of them from 2027 through 2033, some of them in pairs of two.\n\nLucy’s first asteroid flyby was in 2023 when it swept past little Dinkinesh, also in the main asteroid belt. The spacecraft discovered a mini moon around it."

DOI: 10.3847/1538-4357/adbe6e\n\nA team of astronomers at the Space Telescope Science Institute, working with one colleague from the University of St Andrews' Center for Exoplanet Science and another from the European Southern Observatory, has confirmed the existence of a lone black hole. In their paper published in The Astrophysical Journal, the group describes how they studied newer data regarding an object they had spotted several years ago to confirm its identity.\n\nIn 2022, members of essentially the same team reported the discovery of what they described as a \"dark object\" moving through the constellation Sagittarius. They suggested it might be a lone black hole. Shortly thereafter, a second research team challenged that result, suggesting it was more likely a neutron star. After continuing to study the object, the original research team has found more evidence backing up their original claim that it is likely a lone black hole.\n\nPrior to this new finding, all the black holes that have been identified have also had a companion star—they are discovered due to their impact on light emitted by their companion star. Without such a companion star, it would be very difficult to see a black hole. The one identified by the team was only noticed because it passed in front of a distant non-companion star, magnifying its light and shifting its position in the sky for a short while.\n\nThe research team made their initial observations using data from Hubble over the years 2011 to 2017. This time around, they looked at data from Hubble for the years 2021 and 2022, as well as from the Gaia space probe. They found that the object under review was approximately seven times as massive as the sun, showing that it could not be a neutron star, leaving only a black hole as the sole option.\n\nAdditionally, the second research team revised their neutron star assessment in 2023, agreeing that the object was indeed a black hole. They found that the object was around six solar masses, but the higher uncertainty in their measurement still keeps it consistent with the more recent results.\n\nNow, the latest study by the original research team marks the first time the existence of a lone black hole has ever been confirmed. They hope to find more examples with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2027.\n\nMore information: Kailash C.

            "content": "A tiny but radical twist in the fabric of the cosmos could offer a breakthrough in one of astronomy’s most persistent mysteries. According to a new study published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, researchers led by István Szapudi from the University of Hawaiʻi propose that the universe might be rotating—extremely slowly, completing one turn every 500 billion years.\n\nThis nearly imperceptible spin could resolve the long-standing Hubble tension, a discrepancy between how fast the universe is expanding today versus what early universe data predicts. If validated, the idea would subtly revise the standard model of cosmology without breaking any known laws of physics.\n\nA Cosmic Spin That Smooths Out the Expansion Puzzle\n\nThe Hubble tension refers to a well-documented conflict between two ways of measuring the universe’s expansion rate. Observations of distant supernovae suggest a faster expansion than measurements derived from the cosmic microwave background (CMB)—the leftover light from the Big Bang.\n\nTo address this, Szapudi’s team developed a mathematical model based on standard physics, but introduced a slight rotational element. That twist—so slow it would take half a trillion years to complete one spin—was enough to bring both measurements into closer agreement.\n\n“Much to our surprise, we found that our model with rotation resolves the paradox without contradicting current astronomical measurements,” said Szapudi. “Even better, it is compatible with other models that assume rotation.”\n\nNo Broken Laws, Just a New Direction\n\nImportantly, this rotational model doesn’t violate general relativity or any known laws of physics. It simply suggests a more nuanced dynamic: the universe may not be expanding purely outward in every direction—but very slightly spiraling.\n\n“To paraphrase the Greek philosopher Heraclitus… perhaps everything really does turn,” Szapudi said, echoing the ancient idea that motion defines the universe.\n\nThe next step for the research team is to build detailed computer simulations that can detect subtle observable effects of such a cosmic rotation. These may include minute distortions in the cosmic background, gravitational wave patterns, or previously overlooked irregularities in galactic structures."

This vast stellar nursery displays a towering spire of cosmic gas and dust that incorporates new data processing techniques developed since an image of this region was last released two decades ago.\n\nDoes this Hubble image of a sculpted pillar of gas and dust look to you like a curling party streamer, a plume of smoke from a blown-out candle, or an unusual balloon? Regardless of what you see when you gaze at this cosmic cloud, this new portrait is a cause for celebration.\n\nAs part of ESA/Hubble’s 35th anniversary celebrations, a new image series is being shared to revisit stunning Hubble targets that were previously released. New images of NGC 346 and the Sombrero Galaxy have already been published. Now, ESA/Hubble is revisiting the Eagle Nebula (originally published in 2005 as part of Hubble's 15th anniversary celebrations) with new image processing techniques.\n\nUnfurling along the length of the image is a pillar of cold gas and dust that is 9.5 light-years tall. As enormous as this dusty pillar is, it’s just one small piece of the greater Eagle Nebula, which is also called Messier 16. The name Messier 16 comes from the French astronomer Charles Messier, a comet hunter who compiled a catalogue of deep-sky objects that could be mistaken for comets.\n\nThe name Eagle Nebula was inspired by the nebula’s appearance. The edge of this shining nebula is shaped by dark clouds like this one, giving it the appearance of an eagle spreading its wings.\n\nNot too far from the region pictured here are the famous Pillars of Creation, which Hubble has photographed multiple times, with images released in 1995 and 2015.\n\nThe heart of the nebula, which is located beyond the edge of this image, is home to a cluster of young stars. These stars have excavated an immense cavity in the centre of the nebula, shaping otherworldly pillars and globules of dusty gas. This particular feature extends like a pointing finger toward the centre of the nebula and the rich young star cluster embedded there.\n\nThe Eagle Nebula is one of many nebulae in the Milky Way that are known for their sculpted, dusty clouds. Nebulae take on these fantastic shapes when exposed to powerful radiation and winds from infant stars. Regions with denser gas are more able to withstand the onslaught of radiation and stellar winds from young stars, and these dense areas remain as dusty sculptures like the starry pillar shown here.\n\nThis image was developed using data from the Hubble observing programme #10393 (PI: K. Noll).\n\nMore information\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between ESA and NASA.\n\nImage Credit: ESA/Hubble & NASA, K.

            "description": "Discover how crocodiles survived two mass extinctions thanks to their flexible diets and habitats, according to research.",
            "content": "Most people imagine crocodiles as relics from the dinosaur era – unchanged, prehistoric predators lurking in murky waters. But their survival story is much more complex.\n\nNew research from the University of Central Oklahoma and the University of Utah shows that these animals aren’t just fossils with teeth. They’ve made it through two mass extinctions, thanks in part to one big advantage: adaptability.\n\nWhy crocodiles survived\n\nCrocodylians – today’s crocodiles, alligators, and gharials – are the last surviving members of a larger group called crocodylomorphs, which goes back 230 million years.\n\nThese ancient creatures included many now-extinct species that once lived in a range of environments.\n\nThe research is the first to closely examine the diets of these extinct animals to understand how some survived while others did not.\n\n“Lots of groups closely related to crocodylians were more diverse, more abundant, and exhibited different ecologies, yet they all disappeared except these few generalist crocodylians alive today,” said Keegan Melstrom, lead author and assistant professor at UCO.\n\n“Extinction and survivorship are two sides of the same coin. Through all mass extinctions, some groups manage to persist and diversify. What can we learn by studying the deeper evolutionary patterns imparted by these events?”\n\nToday, many scientists believe Earth is entering its sixth mass extinction, fueled by habitat loss, invasive species, and climate change. Studying past survivors, like crocodylians, may offer clues on how to protect today’s wildlife.\n\nCrocodylians vs. mammals\n\nFor years, mammals have been the go-to group for studying extinction and survival. Their flexible diets and ability to live in many habitats seemed to explain their resilience. But crocodylomorphs have long been overlooked in this conversation. This crocodylian study changes that.\n\n“There’s a danger of trying to draw conclusions from millions of years ago and directly apply it to conservation. We have to be cautious,” said co-author Randy Irmis.\n\n“If people study mammals and reptiles and find the same patterns with respect to extinction survival, then we might predict that species with a generalist diet may do better. That information helps us make predictions, but it’s unlikely we’ll ever be able to pick out which individual species will survive.”\n\nShrinking diversity of crocodile ancestors\n\nModern crocodylians are known for living in water and eating just about anything that crosses their path – fish, small mammals, even fellow crocodiles. But this lifestyle is only a narrow snapshot of their past.\n\nIn the Late Triassic Period, crocodylomorph ancestors lived mostly on land. They were small-to-medium-sized predators feeding on small animals. Other reptile groups were more dominant at the time, showing off a wide range of sizes and shapes.\n\nBut when the end-Triassic extinction struck, these dominant groups vanished. Only crocodylomorphs, especially those with flexible diets, pulled through.\n\n“After that, it goes bananas,” said Melstrom. “Aquatic hypercarnivores, terrestrial generalists, terrestrial hypercarnivores, terrestrial herbivores – crocodylomorphs evolved a massive number of ecological roles throughout the time of the dinosaurs.”\n\nFor a while, crocodylomorphs thrived in every corner of their ecosystems. But during the Late Cretaceous Period, their diversity began to shrink. By the time a meteor ended the age of dinosaurs 66 million years ago, only a few crocodylian lineages survived – most of them semi-aquatic generalists.\n\nThe evolution of crocodylians\n\nTo understand what these animals ate, the researchers studied the shape of fossilized teeth and skulls.\n\nSharp, pointed teeth suggested a meat-heavy diet, while flatter, grinding teeth pointed to a plant-based menu. Skull structure also offered clues about how the animals hunted and fed.\n\nThe crocodylian study was massive in scope. The researchers traveled to museum collections in seven countries across four continents.\n\nThe experts examined the skulls of 99 extinct crocodylomorph species and 20 living crocodylian species. To compare, they also analyzed dietary traits in 89 mammals and 47 lizards. This fossil record, stretching over 230 million years, revealed how crocodylians evolved into a variety of forms.\n\nSome were fast-moving land predators. Others grazed like herbivores. Many returned to the water. Today, that wide-ranging history is mostly hidden behind the toothy grin of a croc.\n\nWill crocodiles survive future changes?\n\nWhile modern crocodylians continue to thrive in rivers and swamps, many face serious threats. The gharial of the Himalayan foothills and the Cuban crocodile in the Zapata Swamp are critically endangered. Their survival may still hinge on one of their oldest traits – a flexible diet.\n\n“When we see living crocodiles and alligators, rather than thinking of ferocious beasts or expensive handbags, I hope people appreciate their amazing 200+ million years of evolution, and how they’ve survived so many tumultuous events in Earth history,” said Irmis.\n\n“Crocodylians are equipped to survive many future changes – if we’re willing to help preserve their habitats.”\n\nThe full crocodylian study was published in the journal Palaeontology.\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

            "content": "When the Lyrid meteor shower reaches its peak, it will be spring’s first chance to see shooting stars.\n\nThe Lyrids have surprised skygazers in the past with as many as 100 meteors per hour, but it’s not predicted to be as active this time around.\n\nDuring Tuesday morning’s peak, expect to see around six meteors per hour, said Thaddeus LaCoursiere, planetarium program coordinator at the Bell Museum in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nThe waning crescent moon will be 40% full, meaning a decent level of visibility under clear and dark conditions.\n\nViewing lasts until April 26. Here’s what to know about the Lyrids and other meteor showers.\n\nWhat is a meteor shower?\n\nAs the Earth orbits the sun, several times a year it passes through debris left by passing comets and sometimes asteroids. The source of the Lyrids is debris from the comet Thatcher.\n\nWhen these fast-moving space rocks enter Earth’s atmosphere, the debris encounters new resistance from the air and becomes very hot, eventually burning up.\n\nSometimes the surrounding air glows briefly, leaving behind a fiery tail — the end of a “shooting star.”\n\nYou don’t need special equipment to see the various meteor showers that flash across annually, just a spot away from city lights.\n\nHow to view a meteor shower\n\nThe best time to watch a meteor shower is in the early predawn hours when the moon is low in the sky.\n\nCompeting sources of light — such as a bright moon or artificial glow — are the main obstacles to a clear view of meteors. Cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest are optimal viewing opportunities.\n\nAnd keep looking up, not down. Your eyes will be better adapted to spot shooting stars if you aren’t checking your phone.\n\nWhen is the next meteor shower?\n\nThe next major meteor shower, the Eta Aquarids, peaks in early May.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

            "description": "They’ve survived 160 million years of catastrophes, from asteroid impacts to mass extinctions. Now, one of Earth’s oldest fish may have quietly vanished without a trace. A remote river in Central Asia could hold the last clue.",
            "content": "A prehistoric fish species that once swam alongside the dinosaurs might still be clinging to life in a muddy stretch of river in southern Kazakhstan. The Syr Darya sturgeon, unseen since the 1960s, is now at the center of a high-stakes mission led by researchers who believe the species may have escaped extinction.\n\nA Fossil from the Jurassic Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nThe Syr Darya sturgeon is the smallest of the 26 sturgeon species, reaching only 22 centimeters in length. With its long flattened snout, sensory barbels, and five rows of sharp bony plates along its body, the species shares key anatomical features with its larger cousins, such as the massive beluga sturgeon that can reach over 7 meters in length.\n\nFor 162 million years, sturgeons have survived monumental environmental upheavals. They lived through the breakup of continents, survived mass extinctions, and outlasted the meteorite impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. But despite this extraordinary evolutionary resilience, they now face a threat more formidable than any natural catastrophe: humans.\n\nEnvironmental Collapse on the Syr Darya\n\nBernie Kuhajda, an aquatic ecosystem biologist with the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute, traveled to the Syr Darya River in December, drawn by faint hopes and old memories. He is one of the few scientists who has ever seen the Syr Darya sturgeon—though only as preserved specimens stored in jars in museums across London, Moscow, and Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe region’s landscape, lined with dormant grasses and floodplain mud, is not picturesque. Yet it is precisely this forgotten stretch of river where Kuhajda believes the fish might still exist. “I’ve seen them, yes, but dead, in a jar,” he recalled when contacted by the wildlife nonprofit Re:Wild, which supports expeditions to locate “lost species” — animals not seen in at least ten years but not confirmed extinct.\n\nThe sturgeon’s disappearance coincided with the construction of Soviet-era dams that dramatically altered the Syr Darya’s flow. These barriers blocked access to upstream spawning grounds, permanently disrupted the river’s hydrology, and contributed to the collapse of the once-thriving ecosystem flowing into the Aral Sea.\n\nAll twenty-six existing sturgeon species are on the IUCN Red List of Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered or Extinct in the Wild. In Kazakhstan, the Syr Darya sturgeon sought by biologist Bernie Kuhajda (right) may already be extinct. Photo by David Guttenfelder\n\nA Legacy Endangered by Human Hands\n\nGlobally, the situation for sturgeons is dire. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 17 out of 25 known species are critically endangered, with one already extinct in the wild. Since 1970, global sturgeon populations have plummeted by 94%.\n\nTheir reproductive needs make them especially vulnerable. Sturgeons migrate long distances to spawn, and their larvae drift downstream after hatching. The construction of dams, widespread dredging, and river diversions for irrigation have destroyed these natural migration corridors.\n\nPollution from agriculture and mining has further degraded water quality, introducing toxic algae and sediment that harm both eggs and young fish. The Syr Darya sturgeon is not prized for its caviar like other species, but that hasn’t protected it from extinction pressures.\n\n“It took just two hundred years to destroy the entire river habitat of the sturgeons,” said Kuhajda. Today, even species that once thrived in free-flowing waters are trapped by human-made obstacles, both physical and ecological.\n\nRestoring a sturgeon population is a long-term task. These lake sturgeons from the St. Lawrence River in New York State can live for over 100 years, and only start reproducing between the ages of 15 and 33. Photo by David Guttenfelder\n\nA Final Hope for a Forgotten Fish\n\nDespite the grim outlook, Kuhajda and his colleague Dave Neely are pressing on. If they find a surviving population, they plan to follow a proven conservation protocol: capture mature individuals, fertilize their eggs in hatcheries, and rear juveniles for reintroduction. Hatcheries and juvenile transport programs have already been established in regions where spawning routes are blocked.\n\nKuhajda’s optimism was fueled during a roadside stop at a local fish seller’s stall. After showing images of preserved Syr Darya specimens, a fisherman claimed to have caught a similar fish years ago. This encounter added urgency to the search, reinforcing hopes that the species might still swim beneath the river’s murky surface.\n\nWith custom-made nets in hand, the researchers now comb the silty bottom of the Syr Darya. For a fish that survived 160 million years, its continued existence may now depend entirely on what they find."

            "content": "A bizarre hailstorm of icy “mushballs” — slushy mixtures of ammonia and water — has been confirmed on Jupiter, where intense lightning strikes illuminate these frozen slushballs as they rain from towering storms.\n\nUsing the first 3D visualizations of Jupiter’s troposphere, researchers revealed most weather is surprisingly shallow, yet deep convective systems punch through to unmix ammonia and water, dragging them far below cloud tops. This overturns the idea of a well‑mixed gas giant, with mushballs acting like subterranean conveyor belts that trap and transport chemicals, reshaping our understanding of giant‑planet atmospheres.\n\nMushball Slushstorms Unveiled\n\nPicture a giant Slushee™ made of ammonia and water, wrapped in a hard shell of ice. Now imagine these icy slushballs — called “mushballs” — falling through Jupiter’s atmosphere like hailstones, lit up by powerful flashes of lightning.\n\nAccording to planetary scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, this dramatic weather isn’t just science fiction—it’s actually happening on Jupiter. These mushball hailstorms, complete with lightning, may also occur on other gas giants in our solar system, such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—and possibly on gas planets throughout the galaxy.\n\nThe concept of mushballs was first proposed in 2020 to explain puzzling variations in the levels of ammonia gas observed in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere. These irregularities were detected by NASA’s Juno spacecraft and confirmed by ground-based radio telescopes.\n\nAt the time, UC Berkeley graduate student Chris Moeckel and his advisor, Professor Emerita Imke de Pater, were skeptical. The theory required very specific and extreme atmospheric conditions to work.\n\nFrom Skepticism to 3D Confirmation\n\n“Imke and I both were like, ‘There’s no way in the world this is true,’” said Moeckel, who received his UC Berkeley Ph.D. last year and is now a researcher at UC Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory. “So many things have to come together to actually explain this, it seems so exotic. I basically spent three years trying to prove this wrong. And I couldn’t prove it wrong.”\n\nThe confirmation, reported recently in the journal Science Advances, emerged together with the first 3D visualization of Jupiter’s upper atmosphere, which Moeckel and de Pater recently created and describe in a paper that is now undergoing peer review and is posted on the preprint server arXiv.\n\nThe 3D picture of Jupiter’s troposphere shows that the majority of the weather systems on Jupiter are shallow, reaching only 10 to 20 kilometers below the visible cloud deck or “surface” of the planet, which has a radius of 70,000 km. Most of the colorful, swirling patterns in the bands that encircle the planet are shallow.\n\nSome weather, however, emerges much deeper in the troposphere, redistributing ammonia and water and essentially unmixing what was long thought to be a uniform atmosphere. The three types of weather events responsible are hurricane-like vortices, hotspots coupled to ammonia-rich plumes that wrap around the planet in a wave-like structure, and large storms that generate mushballs and lightning.\n\nShallow Bands vs. Deep Storms\n\n“Every time you look at Jupiter, it’s mostly just surface level,” Moeckel said. “It’s shallow, but a few things — vortices and these big storms — can punch through.”\n\n“Juno really shows that ammonia is depleted at all latitudes down to about 150 kilometers, which is really odd,” said de Pater, who discovered 10 years ago that ammonia was depleted down to about 50 km. “That’s what Chris is trying to explain with his storm systems going much deeper than we expected.”\n\nGas giants like Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants like Neptune and Uranus are a major focus of current space missions and large telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, in part because they can help us understand the formation history of our solar system and ground truth observations of distant exoplanets, many of which are large and gaseous. Since astronomers can see only the upper atmospheres of faraway exoplanets, knowing how to interpret chemical signatures in these observations can help scientists infer details of exoplanet interiors, even for Earth-like planets.\n\nAtmospheric Mixing and Misleading Cloud Tops\n\n“We’re basically showing that the top of the atmosphere is actually a pretty bad representative of what is inside the planet,” Moeckel said.\n\nThat’s because storms like those that create mushballs unmix the atmosphere so that the chemical composition of the cloud tops does not necessarily reflect the composition deeper in the atmosphere. Jupiter is unlikely to be unique.\n\n“You can just extend that to Uranus, Neptune — certainly to exoplanets as well,” de Pater said.\n\nThe atmosphere on Jupiter is radically different from that on Earth. It’s primarily made of hydrogen and helium gas with trace amounts of gaseous molecules, like ammonia and water, which are heavier than the bulk atmosphere. Earth’s atmosphere is mainly nitrogen and oxygen. Jupiter also has storms, like the Great Red Spot, that last for centuries. And while ammonia gas and water vapor rise, freeze into droplets, like snow, and rain down continually, there is no solid surface to hit. At what point do the raindrops stop falling?\n\nSurface-less Rain and Vertical Mixing\n\n“On Earth, you have a surface, and rain will eventually hit this surface,” Moeckel said. “The question is: What happens if you take the surface away? How far do the raindrops fall into the planet? This is what we have on the giant planets.”\n\nThat question has piqued the interest of planetary scientists for decades, because processes like rain and storms are thought to be the main vertical mixers of planetary atmospheres. For decades, the simple assumption of a well-mixed atmosphere guided inferences about the interior makeup of gas giant planets like Jupiter.\n\nObservations by radio telescopes, much of it conducted by de Pater and colleagues, show that this simple assumption is false.\n\n“The turbulent cloud tops would lead you to believe that the atmosphere is well mixed,” said Moeckel, invoking the analogy of a boiling pot of water. “If you look at the top, you see it boiling, and you would assume that the whole pot is boiling. But these findings show that even though the top looks like it’s boiling, below is a layer that really is very steady and sluggish.”\n\nThe Microphysics Behind Mushballs\n\nOn Jupiter, the majority of water rain and ammonia snow appears to cycle high up in the cold atmosphere and evaporate as it falls, Moeckel said. Yet, even before Juno’s arrival at Jupiter, de Pater and her colleagues reported an upper atmosphere lacking in ammonia. They were able to explain these observations, however, through dynamic and standard weather modeling, which predicted a rainout of ammonia in thunderstorms down to the water layer, where water vapor condenses into a liquid.\n\nBut radio observations by Juno traced the regions of poor mixing to much greater depths, down to about 150 km, with many areas puzzlingly depleted of ammonia and no known mechanism that could explain the observations. This led to proposals that water and ammonia ice must form hailstones that fall out of the atmosphere and remove the ammonia. But it was a mystery how hailstones could form that were heavy enough to fall hundreds of kilometers into the atmosphere.\n\nTo explain why ammonia is missing from parts of Jupiter’s atmosphere, planetary scientist Tristan Guillot proposed a theory involving violent storms and slushy hailstones called mushballs. In this idea, strong updrafts during storms can lift tiny ice particles high above the clouds — more than 60 kilometers up. At those altitudes, the ice mixes with ammonia vapor, which acts like antifreeze and melts the ice into a slushy liquid. As the particles continue to rise and fall, they grow larger — like hailstones on Earth — eventually becoming mushballs the size of softballs.\n\nMushball Formation and Deep Descent\n\nThese mushballs can trap large amounts of water and ammonia with a 3 to 1 ratio. Because of their size and weight, they fall deep into the atmosphere — well below where the storm started — carrying the ammonia with them. This helps explain why ammonia appears to be missing from the upper atmosphere: it’s being dragged down and hidden deep inside the planet, where it leaves faint signatures to be observed with radio telescopes.\n\nHowever, the process depends on a number of specific conditions. The storms need to have very strong updrafts, around 100 meters per second, and the slushy particles must quickly mix with ammonia and grow large enough to survive the fall.\n\n“The mushball journey essentially starts about 50 to 60 kilometers below the cloud deck as water droplets. The water droplets get rapidly lofted all the way to the top of the cloud deck, where they freeze out and then fall over a hundred kilometers into the planet, where they start to evaporate and deposit material down there,” Moeckel said. “And so you have, essentially, this weird system that gets triggered far below the cloud deck, goes all the way to the top of the atmosphere and then sinks deep into the planet.”\n\nUnique signatures in the Juno radio data for one storm cloud convinced him and his colleagues that this is, indeed, what happens.\n\nRadio Evidence and Expert Confirmation\n\n“There was a small spot under the cloud that either looked like cooling, that is, melting ice, or an ammonia enhancement, that is, melting and release of ammonia,” Moeckel said. “It was the fact that either explanation was only possible with mushballs that eventually convinced me.”\n\nThe radio signature could not have been caused by water raindrops or ammonia snow, according to paper co-author Huazhi Ge, an expert in cloud dynamics on giant planets and a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\n\n“The Science Advances paper shows, observationally, that this process apparently is true, against my best desire to find a simpler answer,” Moeckel said.\n\n3D Tomography & Open Data Push\n\nScientists around the world observe Jupiter regularly with ground-based telescopes, timed to coincide with Juno’s closest approach to the planet every six weeks. In February 2017 and April 2019 — the periods covered by the two papers — the researchers used data from both the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico to complement Juno observations in an attempt to create a 3D picture of the troposphere. The HST, at visible wavelengths, provided measurements of reflected light off the cloud tops, while the VLA, a radio telescope, probed tens of kilometers below the clouds to provide global context. Juno’s Microwave Radiometer explored the deep atmosphere of Jupiter over a limited region of the atmosphere.\n\n“I essentially developed a tomography method that takes the radio observations and turns them into a three-dimensional rendering of that part of the atmosphere that is seen by Juno,” Moeckel said.\n\nThe 3D picture of that one swath of Jupiter confirmed that most of the weather is happening in the upper 10 kilometers.\n\n“The water condensation layer plays a crucial role in controlling the dynamics and the weather on Jupiter,” Moeckel said. “Only the most powerful storms and waves can break through that layer.\n\nMoeckel noted that his analysis of Jupiter’s atmosphere was delayed by the lack of publicly available calibrated data products from the Juno mission. Given the current level of data released, he was forced to independently reconstruct the mission team’s data processing methods — tools, data and discussions that, if shared earlier, could have significantly accelerated independent research and broadened scientific participation. He has since made these resources publicly available to support future research efforts.\n\nReference: “Tempests in the troposphere: Mapping the impact of giant storms on Jupiter’s deep atmosphere” by Chris Moeckel, Huazhi Ge and Imke de Pater, 28 March 2025, Science Advances.\n\nDOI: 10.1126/sciadv.ado9779\n\nThe work was funded in part by a Solar System Observations (SSO) award from NASA (80NSSC18K1003)."

            "content": "Geologists have uncovered a long-lost continental fragment buried beneath the thick ice of Greenland, a discovery that offers new insight into the ancient forces that shaped Earth’s surface. This previously unrecognized microcontinent, formed tens of millions of years ago, is believed to be part of a complex tectonic rift system between Greenland and Canada.\n\nThe finding not only redefines the geological map of the North Atlantic, but also deepens our understanding of plate tectonic reorganization, continental separation, and how fragments of ancient crust become stranded during the birth of new oceans.\n\nRifting Forces Between Greenland and Canada\n\nThe region separating Canada and Greenland has long drawn attention due to its geological complexity. This is where the Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay connect via the Davis Strait, a region formed by tectonic activity during the Paleogene period, between roughly 61 and 33 million years ago. During this time, Earth’s crust began to break apart, initiating a period of rifting and seafloor spreading.\n\nResearchers now believe that an unusually thick portion of continental crust, between 19 and 24 kilometers deep, was not fully separated during this rifting phase. Instead, it became stranded beneath the ocean floor.\n\nThis continental block is now known as the Davis Strait proto-microcontinent, a term used to describe a slab of continental lithosphere that’s no longer fully connected to a major landmass but not fully detached either.\n\nSchematic representation of the evolution of the Labrador Sea, Baffin Bay and Davis Strait through the Paleogene. Abbreviations: Pre-Ungava Transform Margin (Pre-UTM), Davis Strait proto-microcontinent (DSPM), Ungava Fracture Zone (UFZ). Credit: Longley et al. 2024.\n\nThe Proto-Microcontinent Beneath the Ice\n\nNew data from gravity maps and seismic imaging helped scientists identify the structure and orientation of faults in the region. These patterns pointed to a dramatic change in the direction of seafloor spreading that occurred around 49 to 58 million years ago. This reorientation—from a northeast-southwest axis to a more north-south alignment—played a key role in cleaving off the Davis Strait microcontinent.\n\nBy the time ocean spreading in the region ceased around 33 million years ago, Greenland had collided with Ellesmere Island, becoming part of the North American plate. This marked the end of significant tectonic motion in the area, locking the proto-microcontinent in place beneath the ocean and the edge of Greenland’s western coast.\n\nAdvanced Modeling Reveals a Buried Past\n\nAccording to Dr. Jordan Phethean and doctoral researcher Luke Longley from the University of Derby, along with Dr. Christian Schiffer of Uppsala University, the area’s relatively isolated tectonic history made it an ideal location to study how microcontinents form.\n\nIn their study, published in Gondwana Research, they explain that these proto-microcontinents are “regions of relatively thick continental lithosphere separated from major continents by a zone of thinner continental lithosphere.” They emphasize that such structures are not just geological curiosities — they hold the key to understanding how Earth’s crust breaks and reforms through time.\n\nDr. Phethean notes that rifting and microcontinent formation are “absolutely ongoing phenomena,” adding that “with every earthquake we might be working towards the next microcontinent separation.” Their goal is to decode these tectonic processes well enough to forecast the future evolution of Earth’s surface.\n\nModel of plate tectonic evolution between Canada and Greenland, identifying the position of the Davis Strait proto-microcontinent (DSPM), as well as indicating the location of transform faults along the Mid-Atlantic mid-ocean ridge and continental crust thicknesses. Credit: Longley et al. 2024.\n\nConnecting to Global Geological Puzzles\n\nThe Davis Strait discovery also fits into a larger pattern of similar geological findings. Other submerged microcontinents — such as Jan Mayen near Iceland, the East Tasman Rise southeast of Tasmania, and the Gulden Draak Knoll off western Australia — may have formed in similar ways, through shifts in tectonic stress and partial rifting.\n\nAs scientists apply this model to other regions, the discovery beneath Greenland becomes more than a local anomaly. It provides a template for understanding continental calving and the dynamic processes still shaping our planet today.\n\nResearchers believe that these ancient remnants also have implications for the exploration of natural resources and understanding the hazards posed by ongoing tectonic activity."

            "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nSeismologist Deborah Kilb was wading through California earthquake records from the past four decades when she noticed something odd — a series of deep earthquakes that had occurred under the Sierra Nevada at a depth where Earth’s crust would typically be too hot and high pressure for seismic activity.\n\n“In Northern California usually the (earthquake) data goes down to about 10 kilometers (6 miles). In Southern California, they’ll go down a little bit deeper into 18 kilometers (11 miles),” said Kilb, a researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, referring to the depths at which earthquakes usually occur in those regions.\n\nBut the earthquakes she found taking place near the central region of the mountain range were up to twice as deep — and appear to be ongoing.\n\n“The fact that we see some seismicity that’s below 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) — like 20 kilometers to 40 kilometers (25 miles) — is very odd,” Kilb said. “It’s not something you would typically see in crustal earthquakes.”\n\nKilb flagged the data to Vera Schulte-Pelkum, a research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences and an associate research professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. Schulte-Pelkum was already studying the Sierra Nevada’s peculiar rock footprint, which had shown deep rock deformations within the same area.\n\nUsing the newfound data, the researchers imaged the Sierra Nevada through a technique known as receiver function analysis, which uses seismic waves to map Earth’s internal structure. The scientists found that in the central region of the mountain range, Earth’s crust is currently peeling away, a process scientifically known as lithospheric foundering. Kilb and Schulte-Pelkum reported the findings in December in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\n\nThe hypothesis lined up with previous speculation that the area had undergone lithospheric foundering, which happens when Earth’s outermost layer sinks into the lower layer of the mantle. Now, the study authors believe that the process is ongoing and is currently progressing to the north of the mountain range, according to the study.\n\n“We compared notes and realized that my strange rock fabric (the arrangement of rocks) signals and her strange deep earthquakes were in the same area,” Schulte-Pelkum said. “So then we decided to look at it more closely, and found this whole story.”\n\nWhat’s happening under the Sierra Nevada could offer rare insight into how the continents formed, Schulte-Pelkum said. The finding could also help scientists identify more areas where this process is happening as well as provide a better understanding of earthquakes and how our planet operates, she added.\n\nHow the continents formed\n\nEarth’s uppermost layer, the lithosphere, is made up of the rigid crust and the top part of the mantle, which is in a denser, but more fluid state. This layer also contains Earth’s oceanic crust — a thinner and denser layer below the oceans — and the continental crust that sits above this layer. But how these sublayers manage to exist in this ideal state, with the continents on top, is something of a mystery, Schulte-Pelkum said.\n\n“The continents just happened to be sticking up above the current sea level, luckily for us, because … they’re made of less dense minerals on average,” Schulte-Pelkum said. “To make it sit higher (in the first place), you have to get rid of some of the dense stuff.”\n\nLithospheric foundering is the process of the denser materials being pulled to the bottom, while the less dense material emerges at the top, resulting in land creation. “It’s dumping some of this denser stuff into this gooey, solid mantle layer underneath and sort of basically detaching it so it stops pulling on the less dense stuff above,” she explained.\n\nWithin the imaging of Earth below the Sierra Nevada, the researchers found a distinct layer within the mantle about 40 to 70 kilometers (25 to 43 miles) deep. This layer had specific imprints that gradually changed due north, the data showed.\n\nIf one were to have a block of clay that had spots of different colored clay throughout, and squeezed the clay between their hands, the spots would start to turn into stripes — this is similar to how the rock deformations appear, Schulte-Pelkum said.\n\nIn the southern Sierra, the dense rocks had the strongest inherent stripes and were shown to have already sheared away from the crust, whereas in the central region this process appears to be ongoing. In the northern Sierra, there are currently no signs of deformation. This distinct layer within the mantle would also explain the deep earthquakes Kilb found, as the crust in the central region is unusually thick from being pulled down and is also colder than the hot mantle material typically found at those depths.\n\n“Rock takes a really long time to warm up or cool down. So if you move some stuff, you know, by pulling it down or pushing it up, it takes a while for it to adjust its temperature,” Schulte-Pelkum said.\n\nEvidence for this process has been hard to come by. It is not visible from above ground, and it’s an extremely slow process. Scientists theorize that the south Sierra finished the process of lithospheric foundering about 4 million to 3 million years ago, according to the study.\n\nIt appears that these natural events happen occasionally around the world, Schulte-Pelkum said. “Geologically speaking, this is a pretty quick process with long periods of stability in between. … This (lithosphere foundering) probably started happening a long time ago when we started building continents, and (the continents) have gotten bigger over time. So it’s just sort of this punctuated, localized thing,” she added.\n\nOngoing debate\n\nThe Sierra Nevada has been a topic of debate for decades in the geology community due to an anomaly found within the mantle located underneath the Great Valley.\n\nWhile some scientists believe lithospheric foundering caused this feature, other scientists think it may be caused by subduction, which is when an oceanic plate sinks beneath a less dense plate, such as continental crust, and changes the landscape, said Mitchell McMillan, a research geologist and postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech, who was not involved with the study.\n\n“There are really two competing hypotheses to explain all these data, and you don’t really get that very often in geology. … So this paper is going to add to that whole discussion in a really neat way,” he said.\n\nFurther study within this area could also help scientists better understand how the Earth evolves on long timescales. If the lithospheric foundering continues underneath the mountain range, one can speculate that the land will continue to stretch vertically, changing the way the landscape looks now, McMillan said. But that could take anywhere from several hundred thousand to a few million years, he added.\n\nIn general, large mountain belts, or anywhere there is a batholith, is where you expect to find these events, McMillan said. The Andes, a long mountain range in South America, is an example of another place where scientists speculate lithosphere foundering once occurred and could still be happening today, he added.\n\n“I think this study in particular (highlights) the importance of tying together these different datasets,” McMillan said.\n\nBy better understanding this process, scientists can learn more about the functions of the planet and what happens beneath its surface, including the occurrence of earthquakes that have been linked to this process, McMillan said. Separately, the planet Venus, which does not have plate tectonics like Earth, has evidence of these lithospheric foundering events, and by understanding the process on Earth, we can start to apply it to Venus, he said.\n\n“It’s really fascinating to think about how you could be … hiking in the Sierra or in the foothills, or even anywhere else on a continent. And, you know, there’s stuff going on really deep underneath you that we’re not aware of,” Schulte-Pelkum said.\n\n“We sort of owe our existence on land to these processes happening. If the Earth hadn’t made continents, then we’d be very different creatures. … We evolved because the planet evolved the way it did. So just sort of understanding the whole system that you’re part of, I think, has value — beyond just less monetary damage and less human impact during, say, an earthquake,” she added."

The company has been saying \"late spring.\" Today, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel said they were told June. Several officials have suggested to Ars that the next launch will, in reality, occur no earlier than October. So when will we see New Glenn again?\n\nAs always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.\n\nPhantom Space delays Daytona launch, again. In a story that accepts what Phantom Space Founder Jim Cantrell says at face value, Payload Space reports that the company is \"an up-and-coming launch provider and satellite manufacturer\" and has \"steadily built a three-pronged business model to take on the industry’s powerhouses.\" It's a surprisingly laudatory story for a company that has yet to accomplish much in space.\n\nPutting the brakes on Daytona ... What caught my eye is the section on the Daytona rocket, a small-lift vehicle the company is developing. \"The company expects to begin flying Daytona late next year or early 2027, and already has a Daytona II and III in the works,\" the publication reports. Why is this notable? Because in an article published less than two years ago, Cantrell said Phantom was hoping to launch an orbital test flight in 2024. In other words, the rocket is further from launch today than it was in 2023. I guess we'll see what happens. (submitted by BH)\n\nIt appears the Minotaur IV rocket still exists. A Northrop Grumman Minotaur IV rocket successfully launched multiple classified payloads for the US National Reconnaissance Office on Wednesday, marking a return to Vandenberg Space Force Base for the solid-fueled launch vehicle after more than a decade, Space News reports. The mission, designated NROL-174, lifted off at 3:33 pm Eastern from Space Launch Complex 8 at Vandenberg, California. The launch was successful."

            "description": "An extremely bold hypothesis proposes transient temporal singularities.",
            "content": "Last year, Professor Richard Lieu proposed that there could be gravity happening even without mass. This proposal, outside the conventional understanding of physics, was to explain the effects of dark matter and dark energy, two hypothetical features that are at the cornerstone of the standard model of cosmology. Despite their importance, we have not found them; some people suggest that maybe they do not exist, and the error is in our misunderstanding of what actually does exist.\n\nLieu now has a follow-up proposal that seems even more dramatic. Dropping the possibility of negative masses and negative densities, the professor suggests the existence of transient temporal singularities: mini Big-Bang-like events that can flood the universe with matter and energy, disappearing just as quickly as they form.\n\n“This new paper proposes an improved version of the earlier model, which is also radically different,” Lieu, a physics professor at The University of Alabama in Huntsville, said in a statement. “The new model can account for both structure formation and stability, and the key observational properties of the expansion of the universe at large, by enlisting density singularities in time that uniformly affect all space to replace conventional dark matter and dark energy.”\n\nThe presence of these singularities would act like dark matter acts, adding an invisible amount of matter, five times the amount of regular matter that we know off. They would also exercise a negative pressure, just like dark energy does, pushing the universe into an accelerated expansion.\n\n“In the current theory, the conjecture is for matter and energy to appear and disappear in sudden bursts and, interestingly enough, there is no violation of conservation laws. These singularities are unobservable because they occur rarely in time and are unresolvedly fast, and that could be the reason why dark matter and dark energy have not been found. The origin of these temporal singularities is unknown – safe to say that the same is true of the moment of the Big Bang itself.”\n\nDark matter and dark energy are far from a perfect theory so it is good that they are challenged. Still, there are points of Lieu’s idea that are difficult to square with observations, like the existence of galaxies with less dark matter or more than the average. Also, we need testable predictions. If we can’t see them because they appear and disappear, is there another way to test their existence?\n\nThe study is published in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity."

            "content": "A groundbreaking discovery has rocked the field of neutrino astronomy—scientists have detected an ultra-high-energy neutrino using the KM3NeT telescope, with an energy level 16,000 times greater than the most powerful collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nThese elusive “ghost particles” provide a rare glimpse into the universe’s most extreme events, potentially originating from supermassive black holes or cataclysmic supernovae. The detection of this neutrino, possibly a cosmogenic one, could unlock new secrets about cosmic ray acceleration and the fundamental forces shaping our cosmos. However, more detections are needed to pinpoint its true origin and confirm its significance.\n\nChasing Ghost Particles\n\nOn February 13, 2023, an international team of scientists, including astronomers from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, detected a neutrino with record-setting energy using the KM3NeT telescope. This deep-sea observatory, spanning a kilometer in size, captured a signal 16,000 times more energetic than the most powerful particle collisions ever produced at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider.\n\nHow KM3NeT Captures Neutrinos\n\nNeutrinos are among the most elusive particles in the universe. They have almost no mass, carry no electric charge, and rarely interact with matter. “They are special cosmic messengers that reveal the secrets of the most energetic phenomena in the universe,” said Rosa Coniglione, then deputy spokesperson for KM3NeT.\n\nBecause neutrinos pass through most matter undetected, KM3NeT relies on seawater as its detection medium. Soon, the observatory will span several cubic kilometers, dramatically increasing its sensitivity. When a high-energy neutrino interacts with an atomic nucleus in the water, it can produce a muon—a heavier cousin of the electron that carries a negative charge. The muon travels so fast that it generates a cone of light, known as Cherenkov radiation, similar to the sonic boom produced by a supersonic jet.\n\nKM3NeT is designed to detect this light. The telescope consists of 230 vertical strings, each holding 18 spherical optical modules, resembling pearls on a necklace. Inside each module, 31 photomultipliers amplify even the faintest flashes of light from all directions. These instruments allow scientists to track the elusive neutrinos and uncover their origins, shedding light on some of the most powerful cosmic events in the universe.\n\nA New Era for Neutrino Astronomy\n\nKM3NeT is now detecting neutrinos from extreme astrophysical events, exploring previously uncharted energy ranges. “This first detection of a neutrino in the hundreds of PeV range opens a new chapter in neutrino astronomy,” says Paschal Coyle, KM3NeT spokesperson at the time of the detection and a researcher at IN2P3/CNRS in France. One petaelectronvolt (PeV) corresponds to 1015 or one quadrillion electronvolts.\n\nWhere Did the Record-Breaking Neutrino Come From?\n\nThe central question is where the high-energy particles that hit the Earth and react in its ocean or atmosphere come from.\n\n“By adding observations from other telescopes, we seek to connect the acceleration of cosmic rays, the production of neutrinos, and the role of supermassive black holes in shaping these energetic phenomena,” says Yuri Kovalev of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy.\n\nIn addition to the environment of supermassive black holes, supernova explosions are also among the candidates for powerful cosmic particle accelerators. The high-energy neutrino that has now been measured could come directly from such an accelerator, or it could be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino.\n\nCosmogenic neutrinos could be produced when other cosmic particles react with the weak light of the cosmic microwave background, creating extremely energetic neutrinos. However, since only a single event has been measured here at hundreds of PeV, the origin remains uncertain. To learn more, researchers need to detect more such events.\n\nHigh-Energy Particles from Space Are Nothing New\n\nA somewhat smaller neutrino telescope of the same design, Antares, has also measured high-energy neutrinos from space. And there are a number of other creative experiments that have captured the particle bombardment from space. Such as the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina, which also measures Cherenkov radiation. In this case, however, the initiators among the cosmic particles are protons that hit the Earth’s atmosphere and trigger cascades of secondary particles in it. The muons that are created in the process are not detected in seawater, but in over 1600 water tanks distributed throughout the Argentinean pampas.\n\nExplore Further:\n\nReference: “Observation of an ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrino with KM3NeT” by The KM3NeT Collaboration, 12 February 2025, Nature.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41586-024-08543-1\n\nA Global Collaboration to Uncover Cosmic Mysteries\n\nThe KM3NeT Collaboration is a large international effort involving more than 360 scientists, engineers, technicians, and students from 68 institutions across 22 countries. Together, they are working to detect and study neutrinos—tiny, elusive particles that can reveal powerful cosmic events.\n\nTwo Deep-Sea Detectors, One Mission\n\nKM3NeT operates two deep-sea neutrino detectors: ARCA (Astroparticle Research with Cosmics in the Abyss), located off the coast of Sicily, and ORCA (Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss), near Toulon, France. ARCA is designed to study high-energy neutrinos and consists of 230 vertical detection units, each about 700 meters tall and spaced 100 meters apart. ORCA, optimized for studying neutrino properties, has 115 units, each 200 meters tall with 20-meter spacing.\n\nEach detection unit holds 18 spherical optical modules, and each module contains 31 photomultipliers capable of detecting faint flashes of light produced by neutrino interactions. Data from both detectors are transmitted via submarine cables to shore stations: the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Sud in Portopalo di Capo Passero, Italy, and the Laboratoire Sous-marin Provence Méditerranée in La Seyne-sur-Mer, France.\n\nGerman Contributions to the Discovery\n\nSeveral institutions in Germany played key roles in the study that led to the discovery of the record-breaking neutrino. These include:\n\nFriedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg , with contributors M. Chadolias, Y. Darras, A. Domi, T. Eberl, T. Gal, N. Geißelbrecht, R. Gracia, K. Graf, C. Haack, L.

            "description": "Researchers found LUCA, our earliest common ancestor, lived 4.2 billion years ago. It had a complex biology, affecting its environment.",
            "content": "Every plant leaf, eagle feather, and speck of pond scum spell out existence with the same four DNA letters. Ribosomes read that code, snap together twenty familiar amino acids, and pay each cellular bill with the energy token ATP.\n\nThat sameness keeps biologists chasing one big puzzle: if the instructions are nearly identical everywhere, who wrote the first edition?\n\nThe answer points to LUCA – the Last Universal Common Ancestor – an organism that sat at the split between Bacteria and Archaea.\n\nOne genetic code, one single ancestor\n\nLiving systems are not fond of coincidence. A single genetic alphabet, the same protein‑making machinery, and a universal energy currency add up to more than luck.\n\n“The evolutionary history of genes is complicated by their exchange between lineages,” explained Dr. Edmund Moody, lead author from the University of Bristol. His team sifted thousands of genomes to see how far back the shared toolkit stretches.\n\n“We have to use complex evolutionary models to reconcile the evolutionary history of genes with the genealogy of species.”\n\nBy letting the data, rather than strict cutoffs, decide which features belonged to LUCA, the researchers landed on roughly 2,600 genes – about as many as a run‑of‑the‑mill modern bacterium carries.\n\nCo-author Dr. Tom Williams noted, “One of the real advantages here is applying the gene‑tree species‑tree reconciliation approach to such a diverse dataset representing the primary domains of life, Archaea and Bacteria. This allows us to say with some confidence – and assess that level of confidence – in how LUCA lived.”\n\nLUCA’s developmental toolkit\n\nPrevious estimates swung from a lean 80‑gene outline to libraries topping 1,500 families. The updated theory paints LUCA as anything but a genetic ghost.\n\nInside those 2,600 blueprints are membrane pumps, DNA‑repair crews, and all the ingredients for simple lipids. Better still, the cache includes the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, a tidy chemical loop that welds carbon dioxide to hydrogen, spits out acetate, and releases usable energy in the process.\n\nSuch provisions point to a self‑reliant cell thriving without outside help. That picture challenges older ideas that early life was a stripped‑down passenger riding geology’s coattails toward complexity.\n\nInstead, LUCA seems to have been capable, adaptable, and ready to try new tricks the moment the planet cooled enough to keep liquid water in place.\n\nChemistry of hydrothermal vents\n\nTracking gene changes throughout Earth’s history, the study dates LUCA to about 4.2 billion years ago, only a few hundred million years after Earth itself pulled together.\n\n“We did not expect LUCA to be so old, within just hundreds of millions of years of Earth formation. However, our results fit with modern views on the habitability of early Earth,” said Dr. Sandra Álvarez‑Carretero.\n\nBack then, asteroid impacts and belching volcanoes regularly upended the crust. Yet seafloor hydrothermal vents likely offered warm, metal‑rich oases.\n\nIron, nickel, and sulfur minerals could have driven the very reactions scripted in LUCA’s genome.\n\nThe Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, still used by some present‑day microbes, fits neatly into that setting, turning vent chemistry into food and fuel.\n\nLUCA’s peace was short-lived\n\n“Our study showed that LUCA was a complex organism, not too different from modern prokaryotes. What is really interesting is that it clearly possessed an early immune system, showing that even by 4.2 billion years ago, our ancestor was already engaged in an arms race with viruses,” said Professor Davide Pisani.\n\nGenes resembling today’s CRISPR defenses suggest viral predators appeared almost as soon as cells did.\n\nThis constant sparring matters. Viral raids can shuffle genes between hosts faster than random mutation alone.\n\nThe pressure to dodge infection forces microbes to innovate, potentially speeding up the invention of new enzymes, pathways, and even entire metabolic lifestyles that later lineages would inherit.\n\nMicrobes sharing space with LUCA\n\nIt’s clear that LUCA was exploiting and changing its environment, but it is unlikely to have lived alone.\n\n“Its waste would have been food for other microbes, like methanogens, that would have helped to create a recycling ecosystem,” observed Tim Lenton from the University of Exeter.\n\nIn modern hydrothermal vents, acetate‑producers and methane‑makers trade leftovers, smoothing local chemistry and stabilizing energy flows.\n\nSimilar give‑and‑take could explain how early Earth cycled carbon and hydrogen long before photosynthesis took the stage.\n\nBy knitting together waste and resource, hydrothermal vent communities may have tempered extreme swings in temperature and acidity, opening fresh niches for the next wave of evolutionary experiments.\n\nWhy does LUCA matter?\n\n“The findings and methods employed in this work will also inform future studies that look in more detail into the subsequent evolution of prokaryotes in light of Earth history, including the lesser‑studied Archaea with their methanogenic representatives,” said Professor Anja Spang, co-author from the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research.\n\nProfessor Philip Donoghue highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of the work, saying it brought together data and techniques from across multiple fields.\n\nThis collaborative approach, he explained, made it possible to uncover insights into early Earth and the origins of life that no single discipline could have revealed on its own.\n\nHe also pointed out how swiftly ecosystems seem to have taken root on the early planet – an observation that opens the door to the possibility that life might be thriving on other Earth-like worlds in the universe.\n\n“This suggests that life may be flourishing on Earth‑like biospheres elsewhere in the universe,” Donoghue concluded.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nTo sum it all up, each genome pulled from ocean mud or desert crust adds a puzzle piece to LUCA’s portrait.\n\nAs sequencing tech grows faster and cheaper, scientists will keep hunting for ancient gene families, refining the ancestral blueprint, and scoping out early viral fossils hidden in microbial DNA.\n\nNew drilling missions aimed at untouched seafloor vents could reveal communities whose lifestyles echo those first biochemical gambles, tightening links between geology and genetics.\n\nThe storyline is still unfolding, but one takeaway already stands firm: life did not tiptoe onto the stage. It sprinted, armed with a full toolkit, ready to spar with viruses, and eager to reshape its surroundings – leaving every organism alive today carrying a hint of that four‑billion‑year‑old spark.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

The technology demonstration mission will put a suite of cutting-edge tools to the test, pushing the limits of how light and atoms interact at the smallest scales.\n\n\"No one has tried to fly one of these instruments yet,\" said Ben Stray, a postdoctoral researcher at JPL. \"We need to fly it so that we can figure out how well it will operate, and that will allow us to not only advance the quantum gravity gradiometer, but also quantum technology in general.\""

Ballesteros\n\nAn international collaboration between four scientists from Mainz, Valencia, Madrid, and Zurich has published new research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shedding light on the most significant increase in complexity in the history of life's evolution on Earth: the origin of the eukaryotic cell.\n\nWhile the endosymbiotic theory is widely accepted, the billions of years that have passed since the fusion of an archaea and a bacteria have resulted in a lack of evolutionary intermediates in the phylogenetic tree until the emergence of the eukaryotic cell. It is a gap in our knowledge, referred to as the black hole at the heart of biology.\n\n\"The new study is a blend of theoretical and observational approaches that quantitatively understands how the genetic architecture of life was transformed to allow such an increase in complexity,\" stated Dr. Enrique M. Muro, representative of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) in this project.\n\nProteins and protein-coding genes increase in length\n\nThe article in PNAS demonstrates that the distributions of protein lengths and their corresponding genes follow log-normal distributions across the whole tree of life. To do this, 9,913 different proteomes and 33,627 genomes were analyzed. Log-normal distributions typically arise as a result of multiplicative processes.\n\nFollowing Ockham's razor principle, the researchers modeled the evolution of gene length distributions as multiplicative stochastic processes. In fact, they modeled the action of all genetic operators combined in relation to sequence length.\n\nStarting from LUCA, i.e., the hypothesized last universal common ancestor from which the three domains of life—the bacteria, the archaea, and the eukarya—originated, the researchers found both theoretically and observationally that the average gene lengths have evolved exponentially over evolutionary time across different species. Furthermore, they discovered a scaling-invariant mechanism of gene growth across the entire tree of life, where the variance directly depends on the mean protein length.\n\nBy representing all the species captured in the 33,627 genomes, the team was able to observationally verify the predictions and, moreover, show that the average gene length is a very good surrogate for organismal complexity. In a pure exercise of quantitative biology, Dr. Bartolo Luque from the Polytechnic University of Madrid added, \"From knowing the average length of protein-coding genes in a species, we can calculate the whole distribution of gene length within that species.\"\n\nWhen representing the evolution of the average protein lengths versus their corresponding gene lengths across different species, it is observed that they evolve simultaneously in prokaryotes, because there are almost no non-coding sequences in their genes. However, once the average gene length reaches 1,500 nucleotides, the proteins decouple from the multiplicative process of gene growth, and the average protein length stabilizes after the onset of the eukaryotic cell at about 500 amino acids in a clear threshold, marking the appearance of the eukaryotic cell.\n\nFrom that point onward, and unlike what happens with proteins, the average gene length continues to increase as it did in prokaryotes, due to the presence of non-coding sequences.\n\nAlgorithmic phase transition\n\nA critical phenomena analysis then concluded that a phase transition, well studied in the physics of magnetic materials, occurred at a critical gene length of 1,500 nucleotides. This marked eukaryogenesis and divides the evolution of life into two distinct phases: a coding phase (prokarya) and a non-coding phase (eukarya).\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter—daily or weekly.\n\nAdditionally, characteristic phenomena of these transitions are observed, such as critical slowing down, where the system's dynamics become trapped in many metastable states around the critical point. \"This is corroborated in early protists and fungi,\" said Dr. Fernando Ballesteros from the University of Valencia.\n\nMoreover, \"the phase transition was algorithmic,\" added Professor Jordi Bascompte from the University of Zurich. In the coding phase, in a scenario close to LUCA, with short proteins, increasing the length of proteins and their corresponding genes was computationally simple. However, as the protein lengths grew, the search for longer proteins became unfeasible.\n\nThis tension caused by genes that grew at the same rate as before while proteins could not was resolved continuously but abruptly with the incorporation of non-coding sequences into the genes.\n\nWith this innovation, the algorithm for searching for new proteins rapidly reduced its computational complexity, becoming non-linear through the spliceosome and the nucleus, which separated transcription and splicing from translation. This happened at the critical point of phase transition, which this study dates to 2.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe study not only answers essential questions, but is interdisciplinary, combining computational biology, evolutionary biology, and physics. \"It has the potential to interest a wide audience across many disciplines and serve as a foundation for other groups to explore different research avenues, such as energy or information theory,\" emphasized Dr. Muro of the Institute of Organismic and Molecular Evolution at Mainz University.\n\nThe eukaryotic cell, the most significant increase in complexity in the history of life's evolution on Earth, emerged as a phase transition and unlocked the path toward other major transitions—such as multicellularity, sexuality, and sociability—that shaped life on our planet as we know it today.\n\nMore information: Enrique M.

            "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nResearchers say they have uncovered evidence that early Earth was home to more hydrogen than previously thought, calling into question widely held beliefs about the origins of water and the evolution of our planet.\n\nScientists from the University of Oxford analyzed a rare type of meteorite known as an enstatite chondrite. The space rock dates to around 4.6 billion years ago and is believed to be similar in composition to early Earth, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Icarus.\n\nThe researchers found that the majority of the hydrogen contained within the meteorite was intrinsic, rather than being present due to contamination, suggesting that early Earth would have been home to sufficient hydrogen to have allowed the formation of water molecules.\n\nThis finding calls into question the widely held belief that hydrogen arrived on Earth in asteroids that bombarded what was previously a dry, rocky planet incapable of supporting life.\n\n“We assumed that Earth has water today because of quite a lucky scenario where it had been hit by these asteroids,” lead study author Tom Barrett, a doctoral student in the department of Earth sciences at the University of Oxford, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n“But what we’ve demonstrated in this study is that actually the material which formed Earth in the first instance actually did contain a lot of hydrogen and oxygen,” he added. “The discovery of hydrogen in this meteorite means that Earth potentially could have been hydrated or wet from its initial formation.”\n\nAs for why the levels of hydrogen identified in the study previously hadn’t been detected, Barrett explained the chemical element is hard to measure, particularly at such low concentrations. The detection was only possible thanks to a technique known as X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure, or XANES, spectroscopy, he said.\n\nThe enstatite chondrite is a rare type of meteorite that's believed to be similar in composition to early Earth. NASA\n\n“To do that you need a particle accelerator,” he said. “This is like an enormous, really expensive facility, which we’ve been very fortunate to have used to this study. But it’s not exactly the kind of experiment that you can do in the garage.”\n\nThe study potentially upends our understanding of early Earth, but the discovery of hydrogen in the meteorite doesn’t mean that life would have necessarily evolved sooner, Barrett said. This is because the habitability of a planet may depend more on the way it evolves than the material it is formed from, he said.\n\nHydrogen on early Earth\n\nA team of scientists at the French National Centre for Scientific Research had previously analyzed the meteorite, known as LAR 12252, which had been collected in Antarctica. The August 2020 study found that the space rock’s chondrules, or minuscule spherical objects, and organic material contained within it had traces of hydrogen. The research, however, only accounted for a portion of the hydrogen within the meteorite.\n\nThe researchers behind the new study believed more hydrogen could be attached to sulphur within the meteorite. The team unexpectedly detected hydrogen sulphide within the fine matrix immediately surrounding the chondrules — “on average almost 10 times more” hydrogen sulphide than found in the spherical objects, according to the study.\n\n“We were incredibly excited when the analysis told us the sample contained hydrogen sulphide — just not where we expected!” Barrett said in a statement. “Because the likelihood of this hydrogen sulphide originating from terrestrial contamination is very low, this research provides vital evidence to support the theory that water on Earth is native — that it is a natural outcome of what our planet is made of.”\n\nThe role of asteroid and comet impacts\n\nNext, Barrett plans to analyze more meteorites in an effort to ascertain exactly how much hydrogen would have been present on Earth, and how much may have been delivered from external sources.\n\nWorking out how Earth came to look the way it does today is a fundamental question for planetary scientists, said study coauthor James Bryson, an associate professor in the department of Earth sciences at the University of Oxford.\n\n“We now think that the material that built our planet — which we can study using these rare meteorites — was far richer in hydrogen than we thought previously,” he said.\n\n“This finding supports the idea that the formation of water on Earth was a natural process, rather than a fluke of hydrated asteroids bombarding our planet after it formed.”\n\nMatt Genge, a planetary scientist at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that while the study is an “interesting result,” the evidence is not sufficient to overturn the longstanding theory of the origins of water.\n\nThe meteorite in question had been in Antarctica likely for hundreds of thousands of years, he said, and it is impossible to completely rule out the chance that the hydrogen may have formed during that time.\n\n“Just the fact that there is a possibility makes the argument less strong,” Genge said.\n\nBryson acknowledged that the meteorite was indeed likely on Earth for many years before it was collected but stands by the study results.\n\n“We believe we have taken every effort we can in our analysis workflow to mitigate the impact of terrestrial water on our results, and we do think that some of the total amount of H (hydrogen) in the meteorite is due to Earth’s water (maybe about 15%),” Bryson said via email in response to Genge’s statement.\n\n“We also think that some H (hydrogen) was still delivered from asteroids and comets, however we now think this is a small proportion of the total H (hydrogen) found throughout our planet. So Matt’s assessment of this meteorite is justified, but we strived to minimise his concern.”"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nSchematic of the state preparation procedure. Credit: Oliver Hart et al\n\nImagine the tiniest game of checkers in the world—one played by using lasers to precisely shuffle around ions across a very small grid.\n\nThat's the idea behind a recent study published in the journal Physical Review Letters. A team of theoretical physicists from Colorado has designed a new type of quantum \"game\" that scientists can play on a real quantum computer—or a device that manipulates small objects, such as atoms, to perform calculations.\n\nThe researchers even tested their game out on one such device, the Quantinuum System Model H1 Quantum Computer developed by the company Quantinuum. The study is a collaboration between scientists at the University of Colorado Boulder and Quantinuum, which is based in Broomfield, Colorado.\n\nThe findings highlight just a slice of what these devices may be capable of, said study co-author Rahul Nandkishore.\n\n\"Small-scale quantum devices are rapidly coming online,\" said Nandkishore, associate professor in the Department of Physics at CU Boulder. \"That really prompts the question: \"What are they good for?'\"\n\nThe answer: A lot, potentially.\n\nWhy quantum?\n\nScientists believe that quantum computers could one day perform a range of tasks at a speed that's unheard of today—such as discovering new drugs to treat human illnesses or exploring how atoms and electrons interact at very small scales.\n\nBut building a quantum computer that works as desired isn't an easy goal. Unlike your home laptop, which runs on bits, or switches that flip to either zero or one, quantum computers hinge on a concept called qubits. Qubits, which can be made from atoms or other small objects, take on values of zero, one, or through the strangeness of quantum physics, both simultaneously.\n\nQubits are also notoriously difficult to control, said study co-author David Stephen, a physicist at Quantinuum.\n\nTo explore a new way of lassoing these quantum entities, the researchers assembled a network of qubits into what physicists call a \"topological\" phase of matter—a bit like a clump of very small knots. That arrangement allowed the team to play a simple mathematical game without disrupting the quantum computer in the process, a major challenge for this kind of technology.\n\n\"In principle, there was nothing too surprising about this experiment. It worked exactly as we thought it would, in theory,\" Stephen said. \"But the fact that it did work so well can be seen as a benchmark for this quantum computer.\"\n\nReading minds\n\nQuantum games have been around for a long time, Nandkishore added, and even predate the world's first quantum computer. They are mathematical exercises that allow scientists to explore some of the more out-there possibilities of quantum physics, which can also be tested experimentally.\n\nPhysicist David Mermin popularized the idea of quantum games in 1990. In a typical quantum game, two or more hypothetical human players receive prompts, then take turns filling out a grid with the numbers zero and one. (Picture something a little like sudoku). The players \"win\" the game if their arrangement of zeros and ones completes a certain mathematical pattern.\n\nThere's just one problem, Nandkishore said: The players have to sit in different rooms, and they aren't telepathic.\n\n\"They can agree on whatever strategy they want in advance, but they can't communicate during the game,\" said study co-author Oliver Hart, a postdoctoral associate in physics at CU Boulder. \"It's relatively straightforward to show that there's no strategy that wins the game with certainty.\"\n\nThis is where quantum physics comes in.\n\nMermin proposed that, in theory, you could give each player one of a collection of entangled particles. Entangled particles have interacted in such a way that measuring one will affect the outcome of measuring the other. That's true even if the particles are separated, say, in the next room (or next city) over. In a quantum game, players can use these correlations to coordinate their answers. It's a feat so seemingly improbable that scientists nicknamed it quantum \"pseudotelepathy.\"\n\nIn practice, entangling particles inside a quantum computer isn't so simple.\n\nEven the slightest disturbance, such as a minute increase in temperature, can snap the link between two particles. Those sorts of errors only stack up the more qubits you add to a quantum computer.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter—daily or weekly.\n\nQuantum knotwork\n\nNandkishore and his colleagues wanted to play quantum games in a different way—one that might be easier to win in the real world.\n\nTo do that, the group turned to Quantinuum's System Model H1. This device runs off a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand. It employs lasers to control a collection of as many as 20 qubits (in this case, ytterbium ions trapped above the surface of the chip).\n\nIn the current study, the researchers sent the computer commands online. They arranged the ytterbium ions into a two-dimensional grid so that they generated an unusual quantum structure: Instead of having just two or three ions that were entangled, the entire collection of ions exhibited an underlying pattern of entanglement, a \"topological\" order. It's almost as if the qubits had tied themselves into knots.\n\nThose knots, Nandkishore said, aren't easy to unravel.\n\n\"We have order that's associated with this global pattern of entanglement across the whole system,\" he said. \"If you make a local disturbance, it shouldn't mess it up.\"\n\nThe researchers took on the role of quantum game players and experimented with making measurements of various qubits inside H1-1. They showed that they were able to achieve quantum pseudotelepathy, and win the game, roughly 95% of the time or more. The researchers were able to win the game consistently even when they added outside disturbances and additional hypothetical players measuring additional qubits.\n\nNandkishore noted that on its own, the team's game probably won't solve any real-world problems. But it reveals that today's quantum computers may already be able to grow bigger without losing their edge, at least in a few cases.\n\n\"This study is proof of principle that there is something that quantum devices can already do that outperforms the best available classical strategy, and in a way that's robust and scalable,\" he said."

While microbiome research focuses on bacteria, archaea have eked out a shadowy existence—in spite of their potentially great influence on key metabolic processes in the human body.\n\n\"Archaea have long been overlooked,\" says Moissl-Eichinger. \"They may play a significant role in gut function, microbial gas metabolism and possibly even the development or progression of certain diseases.\"\n\nThrough a combination of the latest methods—including specific anaerobic cultivation, high-resolution electron microscopy and comprehensive DNA sequencing—the Graz research team was able to isolate two special representatives of this group of microorganisms from the human gut:\n\nThe new species Methanobrevibacter intestini WWM1085 clearly differs genetically and physiologically from all previously known species. It thrives exclusively under strictly anaerobic conditions and produces methane and surprisingly large amounts of succinic acid, a metabolic product that is associated with inflammatory processes in the human body.\n\nThe second strain that was discovered, a variant of Methanobrevibacter smithii referred to as GRAZ-2, exhibits unusual features: It produces formic acid, a molecule that may interfere with the metabolism of other gut inhabitants.\n\nBoth discoveries clearly indicate that the world of the archaea in the human gut is more complex and more relevant than previously assumed—and has enormous potential for further research on health and disease.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

This rarely explored area of the gut flora could provide important indications of previously overlooked connections between microbes and health.\n\nIt appears that only through the specific isolation and cultivation of such microorganisms can their characteristics and potential active mechanisms be investigated in detail. \"We can only conduct specific mechanistic investigations with cultivated strains,\" stresses Viktoria Weinberger, the first author of the study.\n\n\"This is essential in order to better understand the role of individual microorganisms in health and disease—and in the long term to develop therapeutic approaches as well.\"\n\nThe discovery of Methanobrevibacter intestini and GRAZ-2 opens up a new chapter in archaea research as well as new perspectives for personalized microbiome medicine in the future.\n\nMore information: Viktoria Weinberger et al, Expanding the cultivable human archaeome: Methanobrevibacter intestini sp. nov. and strain Methanobrevibacter smithii 'GRAZ-2' from human faeces, International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (2025).

            "content": "An artist’s depiction of a halo of ionized gas surrounding the Milky Way (center). Gassy haloes like these may contain a greater portion of the universe’s regular matter than previously thought.\n\nThe universe's missing matter may have finally been found.\n\nAstronomers think regular matter — that is, the stuff that isn't dark matter — makes up about 15% of the universe's total mass. However, for years, researchers have run into a problem when trying to quantify it: They haven't been able to find about half of that \"normal\" matter in the stars, galaxies and other space structures we can see.\n\nBut now, a large, international team of researchers has found that the diffuse hydrogen gas surrounding most galaxies is significantly more extensive than scientists previously thought — so extensive, in fact, that it could account for most of the universe's missing matter, the team says.\n\n\"The measurements are certainly consistent with finding all of the [missing] gas,\" study co-author Simone Ferraro , an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement . The study is currently available on the preprint server arXiv and is undergoing peer review for publication in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nThe hunt for the missing matter\n\nFor their investigation, the researchers used data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, as well as from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope in Chile.\n\nRelated: 'The universe has thrown us a curveball': Largest-ever map of space reveals we might have gotten dark energy totally wrong\n\nUsing DESI observations, the team stacked images of approximately 7 million galaxies to measure the faint halos of ionized hydrogen gas at the galaxies' edges.

            "content": "In northeastern China, paleontologists have uncovered two previously unknown species of feathered theropod dinosaurs dating back 125 million years. One of these fossils includes direct evidence of mammal predation—an unprecedented find that sheds new light on the behaviors and ecological roles of small carnivorous dinosaurs in the early Cretaceous period.\n\nExceptional Fossils From The Jehol Biota\n\nThe discoveries come from the Jehol Biota, a fossil-rich ecosystem in what is now Lingyuan. Known for its exceptional preservation, the site has yielded yet another set of remarkable specimens: Sinosauropteryx lingyuanensis and Huadanosaurus sinensis.\n\n\n\nBoth species were analyzed in a new study published in the journal National Science Review by researchers from the Natural History Museum of China and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nNew Genus and a Predator’s Last Meal\n\nAmong the most extraordinary aspects of the discovery is that Huadanosaurus sinensis represents both a new species and a new genus of small, feathered coelurosaurian theropods. Classified as compsognathid-like carnivores, these dinosaurs were compact, agile hunters.\n\n\n\nWhat makes Huadanosaurus unique is that its fossilized remains contain the skeletons of two ancient mammals—a complete eutriconodont and fragments of a eutherian.\n\nThis marks the first direct evidence of dinosaur-mammal predation ever found within the Jehol Biota.\n\n\n\nAccording to Qiu Rui, associate researcher at the Natural History Museum of China and co-lead author of the study, “Huadanosaurus had robust jaws and powerful neck muscles, suggesting it could swiftly kill prey through its strong biting force, enabling it to hunt mammals efficiently.”\n\nCredit: National Science Review\n\nDiversity in Hunting Strategies\n\nThe second species, Sinosauropteryx lingyuanensis, belongs to a previously established genus but is now confirmed as a new species due to several distinct anatomical features.\n\n\n\nThese include “a large oval concavity between the anterior margin of the antorbital fossa and the maxilla; large lacrimal recess on the lacrimal, U-shaped bifurcation at the posteroventral margin of the dentary, small and crescent-shaped external mandibular fenestra, and fan-shaped neural spine on the axis.”\n\nThe study’s large-scale comparison of 504 theropod species suggests that these sinosauropterygids form “a unique branch at the base of Coelurosauria,” according to Wang Xiaolin, researcher at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) and co-author of the study.\n\nThe Land Cracked, and Dinosaurs Adapted\n\nThe fossil record from this region is not only biologically rich but geologically dynamic. Tectonic activity during the Early Cretaceous led to the breakup of the North China Craton (NCC), creating rift basins that dramatically altered the environment. These disruptions intensified competition and forced evolutionary adaptations in many species.\n\n“In most Mesozoic ecosystems, a single dinosaur lineage occupied one niche,” said Zhou Zhonghe, another IVPP researcher and co-author of the study. “But here in Liaoning, sinosauropterygids evolved three hunting strategies, while distantly related groups like dromaeosaurs and tyrannosaurs overlapped in similar roles.”\n\nThis convergence of environmental transformation and biological adaptation likely contributed to the rapid diversification of predators in the region."

            "description": "As you experience or encounter new things, your brain must encode this information via the right neural networks at the right time.",
            "content": "Every day, people are constantly learning and forming new memories. When you pick up a new hobby, try a recipe a friend recommended or read the latest world news, your brain stores many of these memories for years or decades.\n\nBut how does your brain achieve this incredible feat?\n\nIn our newly published research in the journal Science, we have identified some of the “rules” the brain uses to learn.\n\nLearning in the brain\n\nThe human brain is made up of billions of nerve cells. These neurons conduct electrical pulses that carry information, much like how computers use binary code to carry data.\n\nThese electrical pulses are communicated with other neurons through connections between them called synapses. Individual neurons have branching extensions known as dendrites that can receive thousands of electrical inputs from other cells. Dendrites transmit these inputs to the main body of the neuron, where it then integrates all these signals to generate its own electrical pulses.\n\nIt is the collective activity of these electrical pulses across specific groups of neurons that form the representations of different information and experiences within the brain.\n\nFor decades, neuroscientists have thought that the brain learns by changing how neurons are connected to one another. As new information and experiences alter how neurons communicate with each other and change their collective activity patterns, some synaptic connections are made stronger while others are made weaker. This process of synaptic plasticity is what produces representations of new information and experiences within your brain.\n\nIn order for your brain to produce the correct representations during learning, however, the right synaptic connections must undergo the right changes at the right time. The “rules” that your brain uses to select which synapses to change during learning – what neuroscientists call the credit assignment problem – have remained largely unclear.\n\nDefining the rules\n\nWe decided to monitor the activity of individual synaptic connections within the brain during learning to see whether we could identify activity patterns that determine which connections would get stronger or weaker.\n\nTo do this, we genetically encoded biosensors in the neurons of mice that would light up in response to synaptic and neural activity. We monitored this activity in real time as the mice learned a task that involved pressing a lever to a certain position after a sound cue in order to receive water.\n\nWe were surprised to find that the synapses on a neuron don’t all follow the same rule. For example, scientists have often thought that neurons follow what are called Hebbian rules, where neurons that consistently fire together, wire together. Instead, we saw that synapses on different locations of dendrites of the same neuron followed different rules to determine whether connections got stronger or weaker. Some synapses adhered to the traditional Hebbian rule where neurons that consistently fire together strengthen their connections. Other synapses did something different and completely independent of the neuron’s activity.\n\nOur findings suggest that neurons, by simultaneously using two different sets of rules for learning across different groups of synapses, rather than a single uniform rule, can more precisely tune the different types of inputs they receive to appropriately represent new information in the brain.\n\nIn other words, by following different rules in the process of learning, neurons can multitask and perform multiple functions in parallel.\n\nFuture applications\n\nThis discovery provides a clearer understanding of how the connections between neurons change during learning. Given that most brain disorders, including degenerative and psychiatric conditions, involve some form of malfunctioning synapses, this has potentially important implications for human health and society.\n\nFor example, depression may develop from an excessive weakening of the synaptic connections within certain areas of the brain that make it harder to experience pleasure. By understanding how synaptic plasticity normally operates, scientists may be able to better understand what goes wrong in depression and then develop therapies to more effectively treat it.\n\nThese findings may also have implications for artificial intelligence. The artificial neural networks underlying AI have largely been inspired by how the brain works. However, the learning rules researchers use to update the connections within the networks and train the models are usually uniform and also not biologically plausible. Our research may provide insights into how to develop more biologically realistic AI models that are more efficient, have better performance, or both.\n\nThere is still a long way to go before we can use this information to develop new therapies for human brain disorders. While we found that synaptic connections on different groups of dendrites use different learning rules, we don’t know exactly why or how. In addition, while the ability of neurons to simultaneously use multiple learning methods increases their capacity to encode information, what other properties this may give them isn’t yet clear.\n\nFuture research will hopefully answer these questions and further our understanding of how the brain learns."

            "content": "Magnetars are surrounded by the most powerful magnetic fields in the known universe, but these dead stars are also surrounded by plenty of mystery. And now, thanks to the Hubble Space Telescope and the Gaia observatory, the mystery surrounding one Milky Way magnetar, designated SGR 0501+4516, has deepened.\n\nThat's because astronomers have discovered that this magnetar, which is a special type of highly magnetic neutron star, wasn't actually born in a nearby supernova as previously theorized. Discovered via gamma-ray flashes at the edge of the Milky Way, observed by NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in 2008, the birthplace of SGR 0501+4516 and its origins are now unknown. It is actually now the Milky Way magnetar that is most likely not to have been created in a supernova explosion.\n\n\"Magnetars are neutron stars — the dead remnants of stars, composed entirely of neutrons,\" team leader Ashley Chrimes of the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) said in a statement. \"They're so heavy and dense that the electrons and protons that make up atoms have been crushed together into neutrons. What makes magnetars unique is their extreme magnetic fields, billions of times stronger than the strongest magnets we have on Earth.\"\n\nHB9, you are not the father!\n\nNeutron stars are generally thought to be created when massive stars with at least eight times the mass of our sun run out of fuel they need to maintain nuclear fusion in their cores. That means the outward push of radiation pressure that has been supporting the stars against the inward push of their own gravity ceases.\n\nAs this internal battle that has raged for billions of years ends (with gravity triumphant), the core of the massive star collapses, sending shockwaves blasting into its outer layers. This triggers a \"core-collapse\" supernova that blows away these outer layers and most of the mass of the dying star.\n\nThe result is that what was once a star core becomes a stellar remnant with the mass of the sun crammed down in a diameter of around 12 miles (20 kilometers). The material within such a star is so dense that if a tablespoon of it were brought to Earth, it would weigh over 1 billion tons.\n\nIt is therefore little wonder that neutron stars are often considered the most extreme objects in the universe.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nSGR 0501+4516 was previously thought to be the side effect of a supernova called HB9, as the two are tantalizingly close in the sky over Earth. However, a decade of investigation with the Hubble Space Telescope cast doubt on HB9 as the birthplace of this magnetar.\n\nThis hint was chased up by the European Space Agency's (ESA) star-tracking space telescope Gaia while it was building a detailed 3D map of 2 billion stars in the Milky Way. This revealed the subtle motion of SGR 0501+4516 through the sky and the magnetar's trajectory over thousands of years.\n\n\n\nFurther analysis confirmed that SGR 0501+4516's origin could not be connected to HB9 or any other supernova remnants.\n\nThe origin story of a magnetar\n\nThere are two possible explanations for the origins of SGR 0501+4516: Either it is much older than its estimated 20,000-year age, meaning it traveled for longer and thus moved further away from a supernova remnant, or it wasn't created in a core-collapse supernova at all.\n\nScientists have suggested that magnetars could also be created when white dwarf stellar remnants collide. If you recall, neutron stars are the stellar remnants left behind when massive stars die. White dwarfs, conversely, are the cosmic corpses of smaller stars with masses more in line with that of the sun.\n\nTwo colliding white dwarf stars. (Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nWhite dwarfs could also create a magnetar by ripping stellar material away from a binary companion star and pulling it to their surfaces. If this process pushes the vampire white dwarf over 1.4 times the mass of the sun — the so-called \"Chandrasekhar limit, or mass limit above which a supernova can occur — then it can erupt in a supernova or undergo an \"accretion-induced collapse.\"\n\n\n\nA white dwarf following the latter path could create a magnetar.\n\n\"Normally, this scenario leads to the ignition of nuclear reactions, and the white dwarf exploding, leaving nothing behind. But it has been theorized that under certain conditions, the white dwarf can instead collapse into a neutron star,\" team member Andrew Levan of Radboud University and the University of Warwick said in the statement. \"We think this might be how SGR 0501 was born.\"\n\nThis makes SGR 0501+4516 the best candidate for a magnetar in the Milky Way created through a merger or accretion-induced collapse. If this is the case, studying SGR 0501 could help to understand the puzzle of so-called fast radio bursts, rapid but powerful blasts of energy with currently unexplained origins.\n\n\"Magnetar birth rates and formation scenarios are among the most pressing questions in high-energy astrophysics, with implications for many of the universe’s most powerful transient events, such as gamma-ray bursts, superluminous supernovae, and fast radio bursts,\" team member Nanda Rea of the Institute of Space Sciences said in the statement.\n\nThe team now intends to study more magnetars with Hubble in an attempt to decode their origins.\n\nThe research was published on Tuesday (April 15) in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics."

            "content": "Sign up for the Smarter Faster newsletter A weekly newsletter featuring the biggest ideas from the smartest people Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.\n\nIt’s not something you think about every day, but we owe our existence to a catastrophic cosmic impact. Some 66 million years ago — 10 times farther back in time than the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees — an unimaginable natural disaster put a permanent end to the dinosaurs. This suddenly opened new, rapid evolutionary possibilities for mammals, ultimately including primates. The rest is history, as the saying goes: If the dinosaurs hadn’t become extinct, Homo sapiens would almost certainly never have walked the earth.\n\nDinosaurs appeal enormously to the imagination. It is a fascination that is much older than the blockbuster film Jurassic Park: Even as a small boy in the mid-1960s, I read all the library books on dinosaurs I could find and knew their names by heart. The first fossilized remains of these giant reptiles were found at the start of the 19th century, even before Charles Darwin penned his theory of evolution in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species. We now know that dinosaurs first appeared on the scene some 230 million years ago, and from just under 200 million years ago were the dominant life form on Earth. They might still have been so today had the cosmos not put a stop to that.\n\nWe know from geological research that dinosaurs became extinct 66 million years ago, at the threshold of the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods. These time periods are often defined by the fossils found in ancient rock layers, so it is no coincidence that the disappearance of the horned Triceratops and the dreaded Tyrannosaurus rex coincided with such a geological transition. At the same time, countless other life-forms also disappeared, both on land and in the ocean. In total, three-quarters of all biological species on Earth perished. The term “mass extinction” is therefore no exaggeration.\n\nIn 1979, at a geological conference, Luis and Walter Alvarez (father and son) came up with a controversial theory: The mass extinction at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (the K–Pg boundary) was likely caused by the impact of a 6- to 10-mile-wide asteroid. The two scientists had discovered an increased concentration of iridium, a metal that is thought to have an extraterrestrial origin, in a thin 66-million-year-old clay layer found in Italy. Together with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, they published their theory on June 6, 1980, in the leading scientific journal Science.\n\nIridium is a heavy and rare element. The heat from Earth’s formation caused it to sink — along with iron and nickel — to the core of the molten planet; it is virtually absent in Earth’s crust. Most asteroids never underwent such a process of differentiation, so iridium is much more homogeneously distributed in these small celestial bodies, making its concentration far higher than in Earth’s crust. After a catastrophic impact (where the celestial projectile is completely vaporized and blasted into the atmosphere), a thin layer of asteroidal material, recognizable from this increased iridium abundance, will rain down almost everywhere on Earth’s surface.\n\nIncidentally, the honor of this discovery could have fallen to Dutch geologist Jan Smit of the Free University in Amsterdam. Smit had previously investigated the sudden extinction of foraminifera (microscopic marine organisms) at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. In the mid-seventies, he discovered increased concentrations of other heavy metals in clay strata from Spain, although his analysis did not include a specific search for iridium. Smit’s article in Nature appeared on May 22, 1980, two weeks before the article by his American colleagues (or competitors). It did not take long before the impact theory reached the popular press and the general public.\n\nIt is impossible to put into words exactly what happened on that disastrous day 66 million years ago. A colossal piece of cosmic rock, between 6 and 10 miles in diameter and weighing an unbelievable couple of trillion tons, came hurtling toward Earth at a speed of 12 miles per second. The enormous mass and speed of the projectile meant it had a tremendous amount of kinetic energy: more than a billion times the explosive energy of an atomic bomb (for the number nerds: more than 1 yottajoule). When the asteroid came to a halt on — or rather, partially in — Earth’s crust, all that energy was converted into heat.\n\nThe consequences were apocalyptic. Pulverized and vaporized asteroid material was hurled into the stratosphere, along with 10 times as much molten rock from Earth’s crust. Glowing debris fell back to Earth, spreading far and wide and causing giant forest fires. In no time at all, the finer particles spread all over the planet. For at least 10 years, the Sun was obscured by large amounts of dust in the atmosphere. The average temperature on Earth plummeted at least 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Photosynthesis came to a virtual standstill, food chains were broken, and eventually almost all life on Earth gave up the ghost.\n\nIt sounds like a nightmare scenario, which is just what it was. The scientific community in the early eighties was still by no means convinced by the impact story. Did all those animal species really disappear so suddenly from the scene? Could the dinosaurs not have become extinct as a result of “natural” climate changes on Earth? According to many geologists and paleontologists, the volcano theory also had a lot going for it, given that the transition from Cretaceous to Paleogene is characterized by extremely high volcanic activity. Who knows, it could have been the dust and carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes that eventually killed off the dinosaurs.\n\nIf the dinosaurs hadn’t become extinct, Homo sapiens would almost certainly never have walked the earth.\n\nThat fierce volcanic activity took place mainly on the Indian subcontinent. A small tectonic plate shifted north at a considerable speed of some 8 inches per year and collided with the large Eurasian plate (the “crumple zone” of that collision is today’s Himalayan mountain range). Sixty-six million years ago, India was above the hot spot in Earth’s mantle that now fuels the volcanic activity on the French island of Réunion. But at that time significantly more magma welled up from the planet’s interior: Within the space of a million years, India was buried by as much as 120,000 cubic miles of flood basalt — enough to cover the state of Connecticut with a 20-mile-thick layer. The creation of this volcanic feature, called the Deccan Traps, certainly also had a profound impact on the evolution of life on Earth.\n\nHowever, some 10 years after the publication by the Alvarezes and their team, as well as that by Smit, nobody could ignore the asteroid impact theory any longer. A 110-mile crater of just the right age was discovered below the coast of what is now Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. Actually, that subterranean circular structure had already been discovered in 1978, based on measurements of subtle deviations in the local magnetic field. These measurements had been made by geophysicist Glen Penfield of the Mexican oil company Pemex, but at the time no one connected them to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Thanks in part to the efforts of planetary researcher Alan Hildebrand, the crater finally received the attention it deserved in 1991.\n\nThe Chicxulub crater (named after a neighboring Mexican fishing village: the name means something like “devil’s tail”) is not visible from Earth’s surface. It is buried under a half-mile-thick mass of limestone deposited over tens of millions of years. But in satellite measurements, the crater rim is recognizable as a minute disturbance in the relief of the (largely flat) landscape. Moreover, it is marked by several deep sinkholes (so-called cenotes) used by the ancient Maya as a source of drinking water. Precise gravity measurements, both on the surface and from space, also leave no doubt about the presence of the giant impact crater.\n\nThe northwest corner of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. The image was created from radar topography data. Notice the subtle indentation of the Chicxulub impact crater on the landscape. (Credit: NASA / JPL)\n\nOver the years, more and more convincing evidence for the “dinosaur extinction impact” has come to light: shocked quartz crystals, for example, and traces of catastrophic tidal waves, especially in and around the Gulf of Mexico; tiny glass spheres (microtektites) in the thin K–Pg boundary clay layer formed when droplets of liquid rock solidified and fell back to Earth; and even fossil remains of fish that died shortly after the impact from the violence of a mega tsunami, in the Hell Creek Formation in North Dakota.\n\nBore holes in the so-called peak ring of the subsurface crater, conducted since 2016 from a large drilling platform off the coast of Yucatán, also support the theory that the mass extinction of 66 million years ago was the result of the impact. Increased iridium concentrations were found for the first time in the 910-yard drill core, exactly at the expected location. And microfossil measurements have confirmed that the wave of extinction at the K–Pg boundary coincided exactly with the creation of the crater.\n\nBut even though the evidence is piling up, some scientists are still not convinced. Geologist Gerta Keller from Princeton University continues to stick stubbornly to the volcano theory. Paleontologists have found indications that the dinosaurs were already in decline before the asteroid impact took place, and the climate reversal caused by the creation of the Deccan Traps would have eventually proved fatal for them. Smit and Keller have for years conducted heated discussions on these theories in the pages of scientific journals.\n\nAnd maybe it is not a question of either/or — it could also be and/and. Extremely massive earthquakes resulting from the impact, which ripped violently through our planet’s mantle, could have intensified volcanic activity on the Indian Plate. In that case, volcanic activity was the slow death knell, and the asteroid dealt the final blow to the dinosaurs indirectly. It cannot even be ruled out that there were multiple impacts: the oval Shiva crater on the ocean floor off the coast of India, hundreds of miles across, is believed by some to be the scar of a second catastrophic impact during the same period. A 15-mile crater in Ukraine is also about the same age. Either way, Earth was by no means a paradise 66 million years ago.\n\nDinosaurs, which had ruled the planet for tens of millions of years, did not see their sudden end coming. But we humans are well aware of the danger.\n\nAnd what about earlier waves of extinction? Could these also have been caused by cosmic impacts? Paleontologists have identified four other major mass extinctions: at the Ordovician–Silurian boundary (about 445 million years ago), in the Upper Devonian (about 370 million years ago), at the Permian–Triassic boundary (252 million years ago, the worst catastrophe in the history of life on Earth), and at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary (201 million years ago). In none of these cases, however, has conclusive evidence been found for an extraterrestrial cause.\n\nThat has not prevented some scientists from speculating abundantly on this. American paleontologists David Raup and Jack Sepkoski once posited that some regularity can be found in the occurrence of mass extinctions, which becomes apparent if you include less catastrophic events. Life on Earth would have had a tough time every 26 million years, the two scientists argued. Perhaps this is due to a periodic disruption of the Oort cloud: the shell of icy cometary nuclei surrounding the Sun at a great distance. Such a disruption (for example, due to the gravity of an as-yet-undiscovered dark companion of the Sun in a very wide, elliptical orbit) may cause a temporary increase in the number of comets colliding with Earth.\n\nSpeculation is rife, then, which is not surprising if you realize how little we know for certain about the geological history of our planet and the evolution of life. But the fact is that Earth is in the cosmic firing line, and occasionally suffers a direct hit. However, this is something the planet itself does not lose any sleep over; it can handle the odd collision. Fortunately, the impacts are also not nearly powerful enough to affect the orientation of Earth in space or its orbit around the Sun.\n\nA collision with a 6- to 10-mile-wide asteroid is primarily disastrous for the biosphere — for fragile life on Earth. Dinosaurs, which had ruled the planet for tens of millions of years, did not see their sudden end coming. But we humans are well aware of the danger, and it would be completely irresponsible of us not to properly assess the risks, and not to think about ways to avert such a fate."

Credit: Julian Lozos\n\nWhen Julian Lozos visited the site of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes two days after the event, he noticed something strange. Pebble- to boulder-sized rocks had clearly been moved by the earthquakes—but there were no signs of dragging or shearing on the desert ground.\n\nHe wasn't the only one to observe this phenomenon at Ridgecrest and other places where faults have a similar stepover geometry, in which faults are offset with a \"step\" or gap between them. But now Lozos, a seismologist at California State University, Northridge and his colleagues have an explanation for how these rocks could have been flung from their original resting places.\n\nAt the Seismological Society of America's Annual Meeting, Lozos presented evidence that earthquake rupture within this stepover geometry can cause highly localized strong ground acceleration, stronger than the force of gravity.\n\n\"You'll see a hole in the ground shaped like the rock, and then the rock is next to it, but there's no drag mark between the hole and the rock,\" Lozos explained.\n\nThe extremely strong shaking within the stepover area and less than a kilometer on each side of the fault is enough to launch rocks, they concluded.\n\nSome earthquakes cause even stronger ground acceleration. Peak ground shaking during the 1994 Northridge, California earthquake reached about 1.8 times the force of gravity, and more than twice the force of gravity during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand.\n\nBut shaking during these earthquakes was spread over a much larger area compared to the extremely localized shaking at a stepover, Lozos noted.\n\nWhen Lozos and Sinan Akçiz, an assistant professor at California State University, Fullerton discussed their Ridgecrest observations, Akçiz shared that he had seen similar rock displacement in a stepover of the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake.\n\nTo study the phenomenon, Lozos and Akçiz created models of a simple but classic stepover region, where faults are planar and parallel, overlapping some amount along the fault strike, and having some separation perpendicular to the strike. They published their findings earlier this year.\n\nRocks displaced near the fault stepover during the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake. Credit: Julian Lozos\n\nStepover models like this have been used to study dynamic rupturing, to determine how likely it might be that an earthquake jumps between fault segments, Lozos explained, \"but no one was looking at what this geometry was doing to ground motion.\"\n\n\"We wanted to know if it is the stepover geometry itself, if it is the shape of the fault in and of itself and not the particulars of an individual earthquake that led to this happening with rock displacement,\" he added.\n\nThe researchers also tested whether differences in rupture speed might affect this localized strong shaking. For supershear ruptures, which move faster than the speed of sound, the strongest ground acceleration occurs at the point along the fault where the rupture transitions to supershear speed. The stepover geometry doesn't have any effect, they found.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

The strongest ground acceleration occurs at the end of the first fault.\n\nOn a fault with more straightforward geometry, accumulating friction or release of seismic stress eventually causes the rupture to \"run out of steam\" and taper off, said Lozos. In a stepover, however, the end of a fault segment might not be the end of the fault zone that has been accumulating seismic stress.\n\nIn this case, a rupture that reaches the end of a fault segment \"isn't running out of energy, it's running out of fault, so the effect is like slamming really hard into a wall,\" he said.\n\nThe study suggests that ground motion predictions and local seismic hazard warnings should account for much stronger ground motion in the area nearest to the fault around stepover and other types of complex fault geometries, the researchers noted.\n\nMore information: Julian Lozos et al, Modeling the rupture dynamics of strong ground motion (> 1 g) in fault stepovers, Tectonophysics (2024).

            "content": "A mass of plasma at the very top of the sun rises up from the surface in November 2012, as seen by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory.\n\nOur sun cycles through its pattern of energetic activity every 11 years, but the technology scientists use to observe is advancing at a faster pace.\n\nThat's one of the take-home messages of a new study, which argues that artificial intelligence (AI) can bridge the growing gap between newer and older solar data and help scientists uncover overlooked aspects of our star's long-term evolution.\n\nNew generations of solar telescopes and instruments are constantly delivering unprecedented views of the sun . These advances, which allow scientists to capture intricate details of solar flares and map the sun's magnetic fields with increasing precision, are crucial for understanding its complex processes and driving new discoveries. Yet, data collected by each new instrument, while offering superior quality, is often incompatible with data from older ones due to variations in resolution, calibration and quality, making it tricky to study how the sun evolves over decades, the new study argues.\n\nThe new AI-based approach overcomes these limitations by identifying patterns and relationships within datasets from different solar instruments and data types, translating them into a common, standardized format. This provides scientists with a richer and more consistent archive of solar observations for their research, particularly for long-term analyses of historic sunspots , rare events and studies that require combining data from multiple instruments, the study authors say.\n\nRelated: Earth's sun: Facts about the sun's age, size and history\n\n\"AI can't replace observations, but it can help us get the most out of the data that we've already collected,\" Robert Jarolim, who develops advanced algorithms to process solar images at the University of Graz in Austria and led the new study, said in a statement . \"That's the real power of this approach.\"\n\nThe AI method developed by Jarolim and his team can essentially translate observations from one instrument to another, even if those instruments never operated at the same time. That makes their data-driven approach applicable to many astrophysical imaging datasets, the new study suggests.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

First, one neural network takes high-quality images from one instrument and simulates degraded images as if they were taken by a different, lower-quality instrument. This allows the AI to learn the \"damage\" or systematic differences introduced by instruments.\n\nA second neural network is then trained to take these artificially degraded images and \"undo\" the degradation, making them look like the original high-quality images again. In doing so, it learns how to correct for the differences between the two instruments, according to the new study.\n\nOnce the AI has learned how to \"fix\" the artificially degraded images, the second neural network can be used to improve the resolution and reduce noise in real, low-quality images collected by older instruments in a way that does not distort or remove the actual physical features of the sun that were present in the original data.\n\nThis AI framework allows older data to effectively benefit from the capabilities of newer instruments, enabling scientists to bring less detailed historical observations up to the quality of modern data, according to the statement.\n\n\"This project demonstrates how modern computing can breathe new life into historical data,\" study co-author Tatiana Podladchikova, of the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in Russia, said in the same statement. \"Our work goes beyond enhancing old images — it's about creating a universal language to study the sun's evolution across time.\"\n\nThe researchers applied this technique to data collected by different space telescopes over two solar cycles , spanning a little over two decades. According to the statement, the approach improved the detail in full-disk solar images, reduced blurring and distortion in ground-based observations caused by atmospheric noise, and even estimated magnetic fields on the far side of the sun.\n\nThe team also applied the method to a sunspot (NOAA 11106) that was tracked for about a week in September 2010. According to the findings, the AI produced sharper and more detailed \"magnetic pictures\" of the sunspot that allowed scientists to see its magnetic structure more effectively than with the original data collected by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory , a joint effort of NASA and the European Space Agency.\n\n\"Ultimately, we're building a future where every observation, past or future, can speak the same scientific language,\" Podladchikova said in the statement."

            "content": "HELSINKI — A team behind the rescue of a pair of lunar satellites left stranded by a launch anomaly have revealed the challenges they faced in salvaging the mission.\n\nChina launched the DRO-A and DRO-B spacecraft from Xichang spaceport March 13, 2024, intending to send the pair, totalling 581 kilograms, into distant retrograde orbit (DRO) around the moon. The pair were designed to link up with the earlier-launched DRO-L satellite, operating in low Earth orbit, to test intersatellite links and demonstrate the utility of distant retrograde orbits—high lunar orbits in which spacecraft travel opposite to the moon’s orbital direction around Earth.\n\nHowever, an anomaly experienced by the mission’s Yuanzheng-1S upper stage left the satellites in a highly elliptical Earth orbit, with a much lower apogee, or farthest point from Earth, than planned. Simultaneously, the joined satellites were spinning once every 1.8 seconds, threatening the structural integrity of the spacecraft and their ability to operate and communicate. The rescue operations are detailed by an April 16 report from China Youth Daily.\n\nThe team first eliminated the spin, using the DRO-B satellite attitude control engines to correct the rotation over the course of 20 minutes. Telemetry, however, then revealed issues with both satellites’ solar arrays which needed addressing.\n\nNext, a team, including researchers from the Innovation Academy for Microsatellites (IAMCAS) and Technology and Engineering Center for Space Utilization (CSU), both under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), formulated a rescue plan over the following 40 hours. This needed to take into consideration the complexity of orbital dynamics and gravitational perturbations from the Earth, moon and Sun, and very limited fuel. The team also faced a deadline of mere days, needing to quickly execute a first maneuver or lose the opportunity of reaching DRO.\n\nThe first critical engine burn, on March 18, lasted 1,200 seconds. It raised their apogee from 134,000 to 240,000 kilometers. What followed, as detailed in earlier reporting, was the DRO-A and DRO-B satellites carrying out four further orbital maneuvers, gravity assists and additional trajectory corrections over the next four months to get the spacecraft on course for their intended lunar orbit.\n\nThe efforts ended on July 15, 2024, with the satellites safely in their predetermined orbits, having traveled around 8.5 million kilometers. The satellites appear to have traveled as far as over one million km from the Earth, allowing a low-energy capture and insertion into lunar orbit. The satellites separated successfully August 28. The pair then imaged each other, revealing that the solar panels of the DRO-A satellite were bent nearly 90 degrees, while DRO-B’s arrays were like “broken wings.”\n\nThe pair then established K-band microwave intersatellite measurement communication links with DRO-L, verifying a three-satellite network across the Earth-moon distance.\n\n“For the first time internationally, we have achieved the ability to use satellites to track other satellites, instead of relying on ground stations,” Wang Wenbin, a CSU researcher, told China Central Television (CCTV).\n\n“In essence, the ground station has been converted into a satellite and placed in low orbit. This breakthrough paves the way for new technological advancements in future Earth-moon space and deep space exploration.”\n\nDRO-A also carries an all-sky detector to monitor gamma-ray bursts, similar to that used in China’s GECAM mission launched in 2020. Wang added that China intends to use DRO and its long-term stability to conduct fundamental scientific research in such fields as quantum mechanics, atomic physics and related fields."

            "content": "Researchers have observed an elusive quantum phenomenon that was first predicted more than 50 years ago. This process, which forms a new state of matter, may have ramifications for future quantum computing .\n\nThe phase, called a superradiant phase transition (SRPT), is the result of two independent groups of quantum particles beginning to fluctuate in a way that's both coordinated and collective, the scientists said in a new study published April 4 in the journal Science Advances.\n\nIn this case, the two groups of particles were iron ions and erbium ions inside a crystal. Researchers were able to induce the phenomenon by applying a magnetic field — over 100,000 times stronger than the Earth’s — to a crystal made of erbium, iron and oxygen after cooling it to -457 °F (-271.67 °C), temperatures nearing absolute zero .\n\nUnder those conditions, the team was able to observe unmistakable signatures of an SRPT within the crystal. Their observations exactly matched predictions of what an SRPT would look like according to a famous model formulated by Robert H. Dicke in 1954.\n\nThe so-called Dicke model was the first to describe the phenomenon of superradiance — where excited atoms emit light faster than normal atoms — and laid the groundwork for understanding the superradiant phase transition as a distinct state of matter arising from strong interactions between light and matter. It was further elaborated on by Klaus Hepp and Elliot H. Lieb in 1973 who formally demonstrated the existence of this phase transition.\n\nRelated: Government scientists discover new state of matter that's 'half ice, half fire'\n\n\"Originally, the SRPT was proposed as arising from interactions between quantum vacuum fluctuations — quantum light fields naturally existing even in completely empty space — and matter fluctuations,\" said co-lead author Dasom Kim , a doctoral student in applied physics at Rice University, in a statement . \"However, in our work, we realized this transition by coupling two distinct magnetic subsystems — the spin fluctuations of iron ions and of erbium ions within the crystal.\"\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

It dictates the behavior in magnetic fields and is important for determining the statistical properties of collections of particles, which, in turn, influence the structure of matter and the nature of fundamental forces. When excitation created by thermal fluctuations, alternating magnetic fields or other sources causes a wave-like disturbance across a pattern of spins in a material, it's called a magnon.\n\nIn the past, SRPT was branded a \"no-go theorem\" because it violated a fundamental limitation of light-based systems . But creating a magnonic version of the phenomenon allowed the team to bypass this restriction. In their experiment, the iron ions’ magnons play the role normally occupied by vacuum fluctuations, and the erbium ions’ spins fill in for matter fluctuations.\n\nResearchers were able to clearly observe the disappearance of one spin mode's energy signal and a shift in the other — unmistakable evidence of an SRPT.\n\n\"We established an ultrastrong coupling between these two spin systems and successfully observed a SRPT, overcoming previous experimental constraints,\" Kim said.\n\nThe unique characteristics of an SRPT could have important implications for a diverse number of quantum technologies. This is due to a phenomenon called quantum squeezing, where fluctuations are reduced in one measurable property of a quantum system below the standard quantum limit (though fluctuations increase in another property).\n\n\"Near the quantum critical point of this transition, the system naturally stabilizes quantum-squeezed states — where quantum noise is drastically reduced — greatly enhancing measurement precision,\" Kim said in the statement. \"Overall, this insight could revolutionize quantum sensors and computing technologies, significantly advancing their fidelity, sensitivity and performance.\"\n\nThere are further advantages beyond the precision of quantum measurements and computations due to an SRPT stabilizing quantum squeezed states, as well. Because SRPT arises from the collective behavior of many quantum particles, it could provide a form of built-in protection against individual qubit errors and decoherence, which are major hurdles in current quantum computing. The synchronized behavior could lead to more robust and stable qubits with longer coherence times. It's also possible that the strong, coherent interactions within an SRPT could lead to faster gates (the building blocks of quantum algorithms)."

            "content": "Dolphins and orcas have undergone such extensive evolutionary changes to adapt to life in the ocean that returning to land is now impossible, according to a study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. These iconic marine mammals, once descended from land-dwelling ancestors, have now passed a critical evolutionary threshold, locking them into their aquatic environment forever.\n\nFrom Land to Sea — And Stuck There\n\nRoughly 250 million years ago, some mammals made a remarkable shift back into the water, a reversal of the earlier transition that saw the first tetrapods move from aquatic to terrestrial life approximately 375 million years ago. This return to the sea happened more than once and eventually led to the evolution of today’s whales, dolphins, and orcas.\n\nOver time, dolphins and orcas acquired a suite of specialized adaptations that made them highly efficient marine predators. They evolved larger bodies that helped them conserve heat in cold water, shifted to a carnivorous diet that matched their high metabolic demands, and developed physical traits that enhanced swimming and diving ability. These anatomical transformations didn’t just support life in water—they fully committed these animals to it.\n\nAccording to Bruna Farina, a Ph.D. student at the University of Fribourg and lead author of the study, this evolutionary journey reached a point of no return. Her research examined more than 5,600 species of mammals, classifying them into four categories ranging from fully terrestrial to fully aquatic. Her analysis revealed that once species cross from semiaquatic to fully aquatic, their evolutionary path becomes irreversible.\n\nIllustration of a tiktaalik, an ancestor of tetrapods that is thought to have started to make the transition from sea to land 375 million years ago. (Image credit: Mark Garlick/Getty Images)\n\nThe Tipping Point in Evolution\n\nFarina’s research highlights a “crucial tipping point” beyond which marine adaptations are no longer reversible. This concept aligns with Dollo’s law, a theory proposed by Belgian paleontologist Louis Dollo in the 19th century, which posits that evolution generally does not reverse once a complex trait has been lost.\n\nIn the case of dolphins and orcas, this means that their extensive adaptations for ocean life have closed the door on any return to land. Their entire anatomy—from their breathing and locomotion to their reproductive systems—is now dependent on a fully aquatic environment.\n\nThe study suggests that these animals are “trapped in their watery ways,” unable to evolve back toward a terrestrial lifestyle. While these changes have allowed them to thrive in the ocean, they also leave them highly vulnerable in the face of environmental disruption.\n\nFacing the Future in a Fragile Ocean\n\nAs climate change and ocean pollution continue to threaten marine ecosystems, the irreversible adaptations of dolphins and orcas raise serious concerns. Because these species can no longer return to land, their survival is tightly linked to the health of marine environments. Any degradation in ocean conditions could have severe consequences.\n\nThis vulnerability is compounded by their extreme specialization. Traits that were once evolutionary advantages—like deep-diving abilities or streamlined bodies—now limit their adaptability. If their habitat changes in ways they can’t handle, these animals have few options left.\n\nThis study adds a new dimension to conservation discussions, emphasizing how evolutionary history can limit a species’ future resilience. The more specialized an organism becomes, the less flexible it is when the environment changes."

            "content": "Dinosaur fossils often steal the spotlight, but sometimes, tracks and footprints can tell an even deeper story. Ancient ankylosaur tracks, recently discovered in Canada, have rewritten a chapter of dinosaur history.\n\nThese newly discovered tracks belong to a group of armored dinosaurs known for their tail clubs called ankylosaurids. Yet, no one had ever seen their footprints before.\n\nResearchers working in British Columbia and Alberta uncovered the fossilized prints in mid-Cretaceous rock formations. The discovery includes multiple trackways of a new ichnospecies, Ruopodosaurus clava.\n\nThis finding offers long-sought confirmation that ankylosaurid dinosaurs, known for their weaponized tails, roamed North America far earlier than previously recorded.\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, highlights just how much a footprint can reveal. From foot structure to group behavior, and even evolutionary timelines, these impressions bridge gaps in the fossil record and expand our understanding of dinosaur diversity.\n\nArmored ankylosaur dinosaur tracks\n\nAnkylosaurs are famous for their tank-like bodies and low-slung frames. They fall into two main groups: nodosaurids and ankylosaurids.\n\nNodosaurids had four toes and flexible tails. Ankylosaurids, however, carried club-like tails and walked on three-toed feet.\n\nUntil now, paleontologists had only found four-toed ankylosaur tracks in North America. These belonged to Tetrapodosaurus borealis, a widely documented ichnospecies linked to nodosaurid dinosaurs.\n\nThe discovery of three-toed tracks with associated five-fingered forelimb impressions was new – and important.\n\nThe name Ruopodosaurus clava means “tumbled-down lizard with a club,” which is a nod to both its clubbed tail and the mountainous terrain of Tumbler Ridge.\n\nThe armored dinosaur tracks date back around 100 million years to the Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous. They came from two formations – the Dunvegan and the basal Kaskapau. Both represent wet deltaic environments that supported lush vegetation and slow-moving waterways.\n\nThe most complete specimen, TRMF 2023.09.002, was found beside the Wolverine River. It preserves a left manus and a pair of feet, with all digits clearly impressed.\n\nOther tracks were recovered from sites like Bullmoose Creek and Everlasting Creek – each offering a unique snapshot of these animals‘ movements.\n\nThe prints differ sharply from other dinosaur tracks. The three toes of the hindfoot are wide, blunt, and either triangular or U-shaped.\n\nRuopodosaurus hand and footprints from Tumbler Ridge: Ruopodosaurus footprints from Tumbler Ridge. Click image to enlarge. Credit: V. Arbour/C. Helm.\n\nThe forefoot shows five spread-out digits in a crescent shape. The stride patterns, toe shapes, and narrow walking stance support the identification of ankylosaurids.\n\n“While we don’t know exactly what the dinosaur that made Ruopodosaurus footprints looked like, we know that it would have been about 5–6 meters long, spiky and armored, and with a stiff tail or a full tail club,” said Victoria M. Arbour, a vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Victoria.\n\nDinosaur fossil record in North America\n\nThese footprints bridge a long-standing gap in the North American fossil record. No ankylosaurid bones have been found in this region between 100 and 84 million years ago.\n\nFor decades, researchers thought ankylosaurids had disappeared from the continent during this time, only to return later from Asia.\n\nBut the tracks tell a different story. They show that ankylosaurids were very much present in mid-Cretaceous ecosystems. They coexisted with nodosaurids, as both Ruopodosaurus and Tetrapodosaurus prints appear in the same rock layers.\n\nDr. Charles Helm, who co-authored the study, had observed these unusual three-toed tracks near Tumbler Ridge for years.\n\nHe eventually brought Arbour into the project to confirm their significance. This collaboration paid off with the identification of a new species and the rewriting of an evolutionary timeline.\n\n“Ever since two young boys discovered an ankylosaur trackway close to Tumbler Ridge in 2000, ankylosaurs and Tumbler Ridge have been synonymous,” Helm enthused.\n\n“It is really exciting to know through this research that there are two types of ankylosaurs that called this region home and that Ruopodosaurus has only been identified in this part of Canada.”\n\nRevealing 3D models and skin prints\n\nBeyond visual observations, the researchers used photogrammetry to create detailed 3D models of the dinosaur tracks. These helped confirm the unique features of Ruopodosaurus. Some track surfaces also revealed faint skin impressions, providing rare textural data on ankylosaur feet.\n\nTrackway measurements showed consistent stride lengths, narrow gait, and outward toe rotation. This matched well with ankylosaurid hip and limb anatomy.\n\nAlthough these dinosaurs had wide bodies, their legs were positioned more vertically, resulting in a surprisingly narrow trackway.\n\nComparative studies ruled out other possible candidates. Stegosaurs, ceratopsians, and iguanodonts either lacked the right foot shape or had different forelimb anatomy. Only ankylosaurids possessed the correct combination of a three-toed foot and a five-digit hand.\n\nBone and stone evidence\n\nWhile skeletal remains from this time are rare, a few bone fragments support the presence of ankylosaurids.\n\nVertebrae and ossicles found in the same formations share more in common with ankylosaurids than nodosaurids. These hints, paired with the new tracks, paint a clearer picture of mid-Cretaceous dinosaur diversity.\n\n“This study also highlights how important the Peace Region of northeastern BC is for understanding the evolution of dinosaurs in North America – there’s still lots more to be discovered,” said Arbour.\n\nThe size of the prints suggests the animals were about 120 cm tall at the hip. That’s slightly smaller than some nodosaurids, whose prints measure up to 50 cm. This difference hints at niche separation or varied ecological roles among the armored dinosaurs.\n\nA region rich in dinosaur tracks\n\nThe Peace Region continues to be a goldmine for track-based discoveries. Past finds include tyrannosaurid trails, giant crocodylian traces, and even the largest bird footprints from the Mesozoic in North America.\n\nRuopodosaurus joins this growing list, adding a new dimension to our understanding of dinosaur evolution.\n\nThese armored dinosaur tracks, formed in mud and preserved by time, offer more than just direction. They tell us who walked here, how they moved, and how long they remained. In a land where bones are rare, the ground carries the memory of ancient giants.\n\nThe study is published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.\n\n—–\n\nLike what you read?

Credit: Jeff A. Dror & Sarunas Verner.\n\nThe detection of dark matter, the elusive type of matter predicted to make up most of the universe's mass, is a long-standing goal in the field of astrophysics. As dark matter does not emit, reflect or absorb light, it cannot be observed using conventional experimental methods.\n\nA promising dark matter candidate is so-called ultralight dark matter, which consists of particles with extremely low masses. Astrophysicists have been searching for these ultralight dark matter particles using various approaches and methods, yet they have not yet been detected.\n\nResearchers at the University of Florida recently proposed a new method for the direct detection of ultralight dark matter particles, which is based on astrometry, the precise measurement of the positions and motions of celestial objects.\n\nTheir paper, published in Physical Review Letters, outlines an alternative approach that could be employed in future searches for these elusive particles.\n\n\"Our research emerged from a fundamental question: How can we detect dark matter if it interacts with ordinary matter only through gravity?\" Sarunas Verner, co-author of the paper, told Phys.org.\n\n\"This scenario has traditionally been considered challenging for direct detection. However, building on pioneering work by Khmelnitsky and Rubakov (2014), we recognized that ultralight dark matter—with a de Broglie wavelength comparable to galactic scales—produces measurable spacetime fluctuations that could be detected through precision astrometry measurements.\"\n\nMost previous searches for ultralight dark matter relied on pulsar timing arrays (i.e., collections of millisecond pulsars across the sky that are periodically observed by astronomers) as detection tools. In contrast, Verner and his colleague Jeff A. Dror explored the possibility of employing precision astrometry to probe ultralight dark matter by looking only at gravitational interactions.\n\n\"Our method leverages the fact that ultralight dark matter creates small but detectable fluctuations in spacetime itself,\" explained Verner.\n\n\"These fluctuations affect the apparent positions of distant celestial objects like stars and quasars. Specifically, we demonstrated that the most significant effect occurs through what astronomers call 'classical aberration'—the slight angular deflection of light from distant sources caused by the observer's motion through space.\"\n\nAs part of their study, the researchers calculated how these ultralight dark matter-induced spacetime ripples would impact classical aberration, making it distance-dependent. This means that nearby sources exhibit slightly different aberration than distant ones.\n\n\"These variations are extremely subtle—less than 1 microarcsecond in size—requiring highly precise astrometric measurements,\" said Verner. \"We showed that these effects are potentially detectable with current and next-generation astrometric surveys like VLBI, Gaia, and future observatories like THEIA.\"\n\nThe recent study by Verner and Dror introduces an entirely new method to probe ultralight dark matter, focusing solely on gravitational interactions. Its reliance on gravitational interactions could be highly advantageous, as it could allow researchers to search for dark matter candidates that could be entirely decoupled from the Standard Model, with the only exception of gravitational laws.\n\n\"The implications of our study are substantial,\" said Verner. \"Our method is complementary to existing probes of ultralight dark matter, including cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and large-scale structure (LSS) observations.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter—daily or weekly.\n\n\"When combined with these other datasets, precision astrometry could significantly enhance our ability to detect or constrain ultralight dark matter particles in the mass range below 10-22 electron volts. This mass range is particularly interesting as it corresponds to particles with wavelengths on galactic scales, potentially addressing certain small-scale challenges in cosmology.\"\n\nThe new detection method proposed by this research group could be further developed and deployed in future searches for ultralight dark matter particles.\n\nIn their next studies, Verner and Dror are planning to extend their proposed approach, so that it can be employed to probe other sub-types of ultralight dark matter.\n\n\"Building on this foundation, we plan to extend our theoretical framework to investigate ultralight vector dark matter, which could exhibit different signatures in astrometric data,\" added Verner.\n\n\"We're also exploring how similar principles might be applied to probe the nature of dark energy, potentially offering new insights into the mysterious force driving cosmic acceleration.\"\n\nMore information: Jeff A.

            "content": "Astronomers using the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope have discovered evidence that suggests the presence of a long-sought supermassive black hole at the heart of the nearby spiral galaxy Messier 83 (M83). This surprising finding, made possible by Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), reveals highly ionised neon gas that could be a telltale signature of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), a growing black hole at the center of a galaxy.\n\nM83 (MIRI image)\n\n\n\nM83, also known as the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy, has long been an enigma. While massive spiral galaxies often host AGNs, astronomers have struggled for decades to confirm one in M83. Previous observations hinted that if a supermassive black hole existed there, it must be dormant or hidden behind thick dust. Now, Webb’s unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution have unveiled signs that suggest otherwise.\n\n“Our discovery of highly ionised neon emission in the nucleus of M83 was unexpected,” said Svea Hernandez, lead author of the new study with AURA for the European Space Agency at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, USA. “These signatures require large amounts of energy to be produced – more than what normal stars can generate. This strongly suggests the presence of an AGN that has been elusive until now.”\n\n“Before Webb, we simply did not have the tools to detect such faint and highly ionised gas signatures in M83’s nucleus,” Svea added. “Now, with its incredible mid-infrared sensitivity, we are finally able to explore these hidden depths of the galaxy and uncover what was once invisible.”\n\nWebb’s mid-infrared observations with MIRI allowed astronomers to peer through dust and detect the telltale signs of highly ionised gas in small clumps near the galactic nucleus. The energy needed to create these signatures is significantly higher than what supernovae or other stellar processes can provide, making an AGN the most likely explanation. However, alternative scenarios, such as extreme shock waves in the interstellar medium, are still being investigated.\n\n“Webb is revolutionising our understanding of galaxies,” said co-author Linda Smith of the Space Telescope Science Institute. “For years, astronomers have searched for a black hole in M83 without success. Now, we finally have a compelling clue that suggests one may be present.”\n\n“This discovery showcases how Webb is making unexpected breakthroughs,” Smith continued. “Astronomers thought they had ruled out an AGN in M83, but now we have fresh evidence that challenges past assumptions and opens new avenues for exploration.”\n\nThe team is planning follow-up studies using other observatories, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), to further investigate the nature of the gas and confirm the presence of a supermassive black hole in M83. These additional observations will help determine whether the newly detected emission definitively originates from an AGN or if other high-energy processes are at play.\n\nThis study demonstrates Webb’s ability to uncover hidden structures within galaxies and opens the door to more discoveries in the realm of black hole astrophysics. As astronomers continue to push the limits of Webb’s capabilities, the Universe’s most elusive mysteries are coming into sharper focus.\n\nThe results have been published today in The Astrophysical Journal."

            "content": "Back when the Universe was new, following the Big Bang some 13.8 billion years ago, galaxies took a bit of time to assemble themselves from the surrounding primordial soup.\n\nA new discovery right at the end of the Cosmic Dawn is challenging how long we thought that assembly took. JWST has spotted a huge, ultramassive galaxy as it appeared 12.8 billion years ago, so intricately structured that it can only belong to the most spectacular category of galaxies: the grand design spiral.\n\nThe galaxy's name is Zhúlóng, after the Torch Dragon of Chinese myth, and its discovery has now been detailed in Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\n\"Zhúlóng shows that mature galaxies emerged much earlier than expected in the first billion years after the Big Bang,\" writes a team led by astronomer Mengyuan Xiao of the University of Geneva in Switzerland.\n\n\"Our finding offers key constraints for models of massive galaxy formation and the origin of spiral structures in the early universe.\"\n\nIn the Universe around us today, galaxies come in a number of different shapes and sizes. Lenticular galaxies are sort of blobby and formless, while spiral galaxies have defined spiral arms curving out from their centers.\n\nThe grand design spiral galaxy is the most magnificently structured sort of galaxy, with prominent, well-formed and visible spiral arms curving away from a bright, well-defined galactic center; almost the platonic ideal of what a spiral galaxy should look like.\n\nWe don't have a clear idea about when spiral galaxies first started to come together in the Universe, but they're pretty rare the further back in space-time we peer, and practically absent more than about 11.5 billion years ago.\n\nZhúlóng was discovered serendipitously in data collected by JWST for its PANORAMIC survey, an observation campaign to observe galaxies in the Cosmic Dawn, the first billion years after the Big Bang.\n\nAlthough the survey has spotted other massive galaxies, Zhúlóng, the team says, is truly incredible.\n\n\"It has a striking evolved morphology: a quiescent-like classical bulge + star-forming stellar disk + grand-design spiral arms (defined as spiral structures spanning the whole galaxy, from the nucleus to outskirts, with spiral arms starting at diametrically opposite points), already at 1 billion years after the Big Bang,\" they write in their paper.\n\nIn addition, it's quite large for a galaxy in the early Universe, measuring some 62,000 light-years in diameter, with a mass comparable to that of the Milky Way.\n\n\"What makes Zhúlóng stand out is just how much it resembles the Milky Way in shape, size and stellar mass,\" Xiao says.\n\nThe black hole in its center seems to be quiescent, suggesting that the star formation rate of between 20 and 155 solar masses per year is slowing.\n\nAll together, the data indicate a galaxy that has gone through the throes of formation and is settling down into a sedate, well-defined structure.\n\nThe researchers believe that Zhúlóng represents the earliest example of a spiral galaxy seen to date. This suggests that a Milky Way-like galaxy can form far faster than we thought – around 10 times faster than such formation would take place in the local Universe.\n\n\"The presence of all of these properties makes Zhúlóng very exceptional,\" the researchers write, \"indicating the rapid formation and morphological evolution of massive galaxies in the early Universe.\"\n\nThe discovery has been published in Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in January 2025."

            "description": "MIT chemist Alison Wendlandt designs tools to create mirror-image molecules known as enantiomers. Her group also works on changing molecules into different isomers, with an atom or chemical group in a different location.",
            "content": "Many biological molecules exist as “diastereomers” — molecules that have the same chemical structure but different spatial arrangements of their atoms. In some cases, these slight structural differences can lead to significant changes in the molecules’ functions or chemical properties.\n\nAs one example, the cancer drug doxorubicin can have heart-damaging side effects in a small percentage of patients. However, a diastereomer of the drug, known as epirubicin, which has a single alcohol group that points in a different direction, is much less toxic to heart cells.\n\n“There are a lot of examples like that in medicinal chemistry where something that seems small, such as the position of a single atom in space, may actually be really profound,” says Alison Wendlandt, an associate professor of chemistry at MIT.\n\nWendlandt’s lab is focused on designing new tools that can convert these molecules into different forms. Her group is also working on similar tools that can change a molecule into a different constitutional isomer — a molecule that has an atom or chemical group located in a different spot, even though it has the same chemical formula as the original.\n\n“If you have a target molecule and you needed to make it without such a tool, you would have to go back to the beginning and make the whole molecule again to get to the final structure that you wanted,” Wendlandt says.\n\nThese tools can also lend themselves to creating entirely new molecules that might be difficult or even impossible to build using traditional chemical synthesis techniques.\n\n“We’re focused on a broad suite of selective transformations, the goal being to make the biggest impact on how you might envision making a molecule,” she says. “If you are able to open up access to the interconversion of molecular structures, you can then think completely differently about how you would make a molecule.”\n\nFrom math to chemistry\n\nAs the daughter of two geologists, Wendlandt found herself immersed in science from a young age. Both of her parents worked at the Colorado School of Mines, and family vacations often involved trips to interesting geological formations.\n\nIn high school, she found math more appealing than chemistry, and she headed to the University of Chicago with plans to major in mathematics. However, she soon had second thoughts, after encountering abstract math.\n\n“I was good at calculus and the kind of math you need for engineering, but when I got to college and I encountered topology and N-dimensional geometry, I realized I don’t actually have the skills for abstract math. At that point I became a little bit more open-minded about what I wanted to study,” she says.\n\nThough she didn’t think she liked chemistry, an organic chemistry course in her sophomore year changed her mind.\n\n“I loved the problem-solving aspect of it. I have a very, very bad memory, and I couldn’t memorize my way through the class, so I had to just learn it, and that was just so fun,” she says.\n\nAs a chemistry major, she began working in a lab focused on “total synthesis,” a research area that involves developing strategies to synthesize a complex molecule, often a natural compound, from scratch.\n\nAlthough she loved organic chemistry, a lab accident — an explosion that injured a student in her lab and led to temporary hearing loss for Wendlandt — made her hesitant to pursue it further. When she applied to graduate schools, she decided to go into a different branch of chemistry — chemical biology. She studied at Yale University for a couple of years, but she realized that she didn’t enjoy that type of chemistry and left after receiving a master’s degree.\n\nShe worked in a lab at the University of Kentucky for a few years, then applied to graduate school again, this time at the University of Wisconsin. There, she worked in an organic chemistry lab, studying oxidation reactions that could be used to generate pharmaceuticals or other useful compounds from petrochemicals.\n\nAfter finishing her PhD in 2015, Wendlandt went to Harvard University for a postdoc, working with chemistry professor Eric Jacobsen. There, she became interested in selective chemical reactions that generate a particular isomer, and began studying catalysts that could perform glycosylation — the addition of sugar molecules to other molecules — at specific sites.\n\nEditing molecules\n\nSince joining the MIT faculty in 2018, Wendlandt has worked on developing catalysts that can convert a molecule into its mirror image or an isomer of the original.\n\nIn 2022, she and her students developed a tool called a stereo-editor, which can alter the arrangement of chemical groups around a central atom known as a stereocenter. This editor consists of two catalysts that work together to first add enough energy to remove an atom from a stereocenter, then replace it with an atom that has the opposite orientation. That energy input comes from a photocatalyst, which converts captured light into energy.\n\n“If you have a molecule with an existing stereocenter, and you need the other enantiomer, typically you would have to start over and make the other enantiomer. But this new method tries to interconvert them directly, so it gives you a way of thinking about molecules as dynamic,” Wendlandt says. “You could generate any sort of three-dimensional structure of that molecule, and then in an independent step later, you could completely reorganize the 3D structure.”\n\nShe has also developed tools that can convert common sugars such as glucose into other isomers, including allose and other sugars that are difficult to isolate from natural sources, and tools that can create new isomers of steroids and alcohols. She is now working on ways to convert six-membered carbon rings to seven or eight-membered rings, and to add, subtract, or replace some of the chemical groups attached to the rings.\n\n“I’m interested in creating general tools that will allow us to interconvert static structures. So, that may be taking a certain functional group and moving it to another part of the molecule entirely, or taking large rings and making them small rings,” she says. “Instead of thinking of molecules that we assemble as static, we’re thinking about them now as potentially dynamic structures, which could change how we think about making organic molecules.”\n\nThis approach also opens up the possibility of creating brand new molecules that haven’t been seen before, Wendlandt says. This could be useful, for example, to create drug molecules that interact with a target enzyme in just the right way.\n\n“There’s a huge amount of chemical space that’s still unknown, bizarre chemical space that just has not been made. That’s in part because maybe no one has been interested in it, or because it’s just too hard to make that specific thing,” she says. “These kinds of tools give you access to isomers that are maybe not easily made.”"

            "content": "The Rays announced that they have selected the contract of outfielder Chandler Simpson. Outfielder Richie Palacios is heading back to the injured list with a right knee sprain. Right-hander Alex Faedo has been transferred to the 60-day IL as the corresponding move to get Simpson onto the 40-man. Faedo started the season on the 15-day IL due to shoulder inflammation. His current status is unclear but he’s now ineligible to return until late May at the earliest. Marc Topkin of The Tampa Bay Times reported the moves prior to the official announcement.\n\nSimpson, 24, is one of the most interesting prospects in baseball on account of his base-stealing acumen. The Rays drafted him with the 70th overall pick in 2022, a Competitive Balance Round B selection. In his first full professional season in 2023, he stole 81 bases in 93 attempts, appearing in just 91 games. Last year, he got into 110 minor league games and swiped 104 bags in 121 attempts. He is 8 for 11 so far here in 2025.\n\nHis work at the plate has been competent enough, in a powerless sort of way. He has 1,120 minor league plate appearances thus far across various levels. He has just one home run, which was of the inside-the-park variety. But has walked more than he has struck out, a 9.6% rate of free passes compared to an 8.8% rate of punchouts. That has helped him produce a bizarrely level slash line of .324/.389/.371. That translates to a 123 wRC+, indicating he’s been 23% above league average overall.\n\nIt’s a very intriguing combination. Many recent speed specialists have had their production undercut by an inability to put the bat on the ball and/or get on base. Billy Hamilton spent many years as baseball’s fastest man but he hit just .239/.292/.325 in his big league career. While he was a good bet for 50-plus steals annually and some highlight-reel catches, the lack of offense made him difficult to roster. Guys like Juan Pierre, Rajai Davis and Dee Strange-Gordon were somewhat similar, swiping hundreds of bags but with subpar hitting.\n\nIf Simpson can get on base a bit more than guys in that group, perhaps he can be a bit more of a difference maker. Though even if not, a player with elite speed and can still be plenty valuable on the basepaths and in the outfield.\n\nProspect evaluators are a bit split on what kind of big league impact Simpson can make. FanGraphs is one outlet that is especially bullish, as they ranked him the #72 prospect in all of baseball heading into this season. They noted that his contact ability is almost at the level of guys like Luis Arráez and Steven Kwan, though a smidge below. However, they also caution that speed-and-defense players like Myles Straw and Nick Madrigal offer a sort of cautionary tale of how things could go wrong for Simpson with little offensive impact.\n\nThe report from FanGraphs also adds that the defense is a work in progress. Simpson was a second baseman in college and is still getting used to the outfield. They note that his routes aren’t always great but his speed gives him a lot of room for error. If he can continue to develop his routes, there’s a tremendous ceiling there.\n\nESPN gave Simpson the #91 spot heading into the season but Simpson didn’t crack the top 100 with Baseball America, MLB Pipeline or Keith Law of The Athletic. BA ranked him #8 in the Rays’ system coming into the year, seemingly with a bit more concern about the defense and lack of power.\n\nThe divisive scouting reports mean that the prospect promotion incentive is not at play here. To be PPI eligible, a player must be on two of the BA/ESPN/MLB Pipeline lists and Simpson only cracked one. It’s too late in the season now for Simpson to get a full year of service time. Even if he’s up for good, he won’t be able to qualify for free agency until after 2031, though he has a chance to reach arbitration after 2027 as a Super Two player.\n\nThe Rays have three outfielders on the IL in Palacios, Jonny DeLuca and Josh Lowe. Their outfield playing time has been going to Kameron Misner, Christopher Morel, Jake Mangum and José Caballero lately. Simpson will slot into that group and test his mettle against big league pitching.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Kim Klement Neitzel, Imagn Images"

            "content": "\"I am looking forward to continuing our work with the players, coaches and staff to make the 2025 season a success as we keep fighting to win trophies.”\n\n“It is an honor to be the head coach of LAFC,” Cherundolo said via a press release. “After much reflection and discussion with my family, we made the decision that at the end of this year we will return to Germany. I love Los Angeles and LAFC, but this move is in the best interest of my family, even as it will ultimately take us away from a team, city, organization and fan base that I am proud to represent.\n\nThe San Diego native has an 87W-43L-26D record with LAFC across all competitions and has reached six finals.\n\nCherundolo was named as Bob Bradley's successor in January 2022, leading the Black & Gold to that year's MLS Cup-Supporters' Shield double. He also won the 2024 US Open Cup title and reached the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup final.\n\n\"For the remainder of 2025, our goals have not changed. We remain committed to winning trophies this season. We believe we have the people to make that happen, and there will be no better way to close this chapter than with another trophy for LAFC.”\n\n“Steve has been a tremendous leader for LAFC and has proven to be one of the top coaches in our league,” co-president & general manager John Thorrington said. “What he has achieved during his tenure speaks for itself, and we are extremely thankful to him for his continued dedication and hard work. We support his decision to focus on his family with this move at the end of the season.\n\nThe club's second-ever manager, Cherundolo was a 2022 MLS Sigi Schmid Coach of the Year finalist after guiding the Black & Gold to the seventh (and most recent) MLS Cup-Supporters' Shield double in league history.\n\nA statement from the Club. LAFC Head Coach Steve Cherundolo announced today that he will step down from his position at the completion of the 2025 MLS season.\n\nA former US men’s national team and Bundesliga defender, Cherundolo previously led USL Championship side Las Vegas Lights and held various roles in Germany.\n\n“It has been a pleasure working with and building a strong relationship with Steve over these last few years, and I thank him for everything he has given to the club,” lead managing owner Bennett Rosenthal said.\n\n“Steve has built upon the foundation of the Black & Gold standard, and we wish him success with us for the rest of this season and in his future endeavors. We appreciate and respect Steve’s desire to move with his family at the end of this season. On behalf of myself, Brandon Beck, Larry Berg and our other owners, I can assure you that Steve will always be a part of our LAFC family.”\n\nLAFC currently sit seventh in the Western Conference with a 4W-4L-0D record (12 points) and exited the 2025 CCC earlier this month after their quarterfinal loss to Inter Miami CF. They will also participate in this year's Leagues Cup tournament."

            "description": "McLaren didn't look all that far ahead over a single lap in Saudi Arabian Grand Prix Friday practice - but the race runs painted a very, very different picture",
            "content": "Jeddah’s formidable high-grip, high-speed, high-jeopardy challenge was very visibly evident on the first day of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix weekend.\n\nWhat was also very evident was McLaren’s continuing 2025 advantage, seen here to perhaps an even greater degree than on Friday in Bahrain before Pirelli’s reduction in minimum rear tyre pressures there brought the others a little closer on the Saturday.\n\nOn the assumption that Pirelli doesn’t do something similar again here, McLaren’s advantage appears to be in the order of around 0.3s over a qualifying lap, but stretching to an average of around 0.7s to the next best in a race stint simulation.\n\nIt was a complicated comparison, but the picture of McLaren’s advantage emerges regardless.\n\nThe complication came from the Yuki Tsunoda-induced red flag in FP2 just as everyone was early into their long runs. So the only direct comparison possible in that session was between the early starters, Oscar Piastri on 1m33.9s and Max Verstappen on 1m35.0s. That was, of course, the twilight session with the cooler, faster track which best represents qualifying and race. However, in FP1, with the track around 20°C hotter, long runs were made then, too.\n\nThe combined sessions showed the following averages, all on the medium C4 tyre:\n\nFP1\n\nNorris 1m33.6s (7 laps)\n\nRussell 1m34.4s (3 laps)\n\nPiastri 1m34.3s (4 laps)\n\nLeclerc 1m34.6s (8 laps)\n\nAntonelli 1m34.6s (7 laps)\n\nGasly 1m35.0s (6 laps)\n\nHamilton 1m35.3s (4 laps)\n\n\n\nFP2\n\nPiastri 1m33.9s (4 laps)\n\nVerstappen 1m35.0s (7 laps)\n\nEven more impressive than the McLaren’s averages were how they were achieved, with so little degradation on a track which places heavy demands on the rear temperatures. The opposite extreme was the Red Bull, in which Max Verstappen was complaining that his right rears were ‘gone’ after eight laps.\n\nIn fact, the degradation rates between the top four teams aligned very closely with the amount of rear wing they were each running on this low-downforce track, with McLaren carrying the biggest in area, Red Bull the least and Mercedes and Ferrari inbetween.\n\nLooking at Lando Norris’ FP1 long run on a track where deg would be expected to be higher than in FP2, his total apparent deg over seven laps was only 0.076s. Compare that to Verstappen’s seven-lap run in FP2 - where his total apparent deg was 1.25s.\n\nSo not only was the McLaren lapping significantly faster, it was taking less from its tyres while doing so. The apparent tyre degradation in this case is calculated by subtracting the effect of a 2kg reduction in fuel weight per lap and comparing the actual time for each lap. The difference should be the tyre deg, though it’s not an exact science as the drivers will begin the stint estimating the pace at which their tyres can live.\n\nAlthough the Red Bull looks the weakest of the top four cars over a race stint, Verstappen managed to go third-fastest behind the two McLarens in FP2, around 0.3s adrift of Norris.\n\nLooking at the respective laps of Norris and Verstappen, they are virtually neck-and-neck by the time they arrive at the Turn 13 hairpin, which turns them round and sets them toward sectors two and three.\n\nThat’s where the Red Bull’s tyres are beginning to give up as the McLaren’s are still good. This tends to be the case even when they run similar wing levels but it’s even more distinctive with the respective wing choices here.\n\nBy the exit of Turn 13, Verstappen has lost 0.1s just in that corner alone. He gets a little bit back before they have to brake for the fifth gear Turn 15 – and here he loses a big chunk, the gap out to 0.27s at the exit.\n\nOur trackside verdict on every car at Jeddah: Low-speed and high-speed Read more\n\nHe maintains that gap for rest of lap, gaining on straights, losing it all again on the turns. For the fifth-gear Turn 22, Norris is braking 10 metres later and his mid-corner minimum speed is 207km/h compared to Verstappen’s 189.\n\n“Today we tried some different things with the car,” said Verstappen, “and worked to find a different direction. I think we learned quite a lot but it’s still not where we want the car to be.”\n\nCharles Leclerc did his best lap on a used set of tyres after pitting at the end of his first attempt for a whole four clicks less front wing, giving some idea of how wayward he was finding it. The margin by which he’s trailing Verstappen is around the same as what you would expect from the tyre life difference.\n\nThe Ferrari clips earlier on the pit straight than the Red Bull but its speed through the straights and flat kinks of sector one is about the same. We’re comparing a used tyre lap to a new so it's not a fair comparison of corner speed, this really showing in the low-speed corners where the Ferrari is usually the best. But in the fast Turn 22, it’s faster than the Red Bull, Leclerc four metres later on the brakes and with a mid-corner minimum of 197km/h.\n\nMercedes is not the fastest on the straights here, unlike in Bahrain. But it's the closest to Red Bull.\n\nRussell looked the closest threat to McLaren on the long runs of FP1 but his C5 run in FP2 was made earlier than anyone else’s, partly explaining its relatively lowly place in the headline times.\n\n“We didn't manage to get too many clean laps in,” said Russell, “owing to both traffic and a few efforts where we didn't quite the tyres in the right window. We tried some different things across both cars, which was definitely valuable learning for both Kimi [Antonelli] and myself. I think we've found the direction we will move in now.\n\n\"We were probably stronger in FP1 than FP2 ultimately. We didn't quite take the step forward with the car that we were hoping to, but I don't think there's anything that we can't improve overnight.”\n\nBefore his crash Tsunoda was comparing well to Verstappen, his new-tyre lap being compromised by the out-lap preparation. Lewis Hamilton was struggling with the demanding Ferrari once more, around 0.5s adrift of Leclerc. “It was a challenging day,” he said. “We’re still chasing the right balance between the front and rear axles, and I’m struggling a bit with consistency across the lap at this stage.” Antonelli had a few adventures which he got away with - and needs to find around a quarter-second to Russell.\n\nPierre Gasly demonstrated that Bahrain was no fluke, the Alpine again looking the best of the rest ahead of Williams.\n\nThe biggest difficulty facing McLaren is going to be ensuring equality between its drivers. An updated diffuser was brought here, but only one of them. Piastri tried it in FP1, Norris in FP2.\n\nNorris looked quicker regardless of which spec he was running and Piastri admitted there are a few corners in which “I need to do a better job”. Most of Norris’ advantage was coming in the first two turns, where his aggressive approach was impressively fast."

            "description": "Aaron Boone says Chisholm is appealing the decision and will play Friday",
            "content": "New York Yankees second baseman Jazz Chisholm was ejected from Thursday night's 6-3 victory against the Tampa Bay Rays (box score) after disagreeing with a strikeout call from home-plate umpire John Bacon. Chisholm (or whoever manages his social media account) didn't wait long afterward to air his frustration on social media, tweeting out: \"Not even [freaking] close!!!!!\" about five minutes after being sent to the showers. He later deleted the message.\n\nOn Friday, MLB announced that Chisholm has been suspended for one game and fined for violating the league's social media policy for players. Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Chisholm is appealing the decision and was in the lineup on Friday night for the Yankees' 1-0 win over the Rays.\n\nHere's a look at the call in question. It occurred during the top of the seventh inning, with Chisholm sporting a full count versus left-handed reliever Mason Montgomery.\n\nAccording to TruMedia's data, that pitch had a called strike probability of 19.3%. (In the interest of fairness: Chisholm benefitted earlier in the at-bat, when he was awarded ball three on a pitch that had a called strike probability of 92.6%.)\n\nAfter the game, Chisholm told reporters that he didn't feel anything he said before being ejected merited the punishment, though he conceded what he said after likely did. Chisholm also said that while he remained upset that Bacon missed the call, he was mad at himself for losing his cool.\n\n\"I'm a competitor, so when I go out there and I feel like I'm right and you're saying something to me that I think doesn't make sense, I'm going to get fired up and be upset,\" Chisholm said. \"I lost my emotions, I lost my cool. At the same time, I still got to be able to stay out there and play defense for my team. That's why I'm here. I got to be better in that aspect of helping my team.\"\n\nAs New York Daily News beat writer Gary Phillips pointed out, Chisholm's tweet would appear to violate the MLB Players Association's social media policy. Said policy can be viewed here in its 2023 form. Notably, it forbids players from using electronic devices during games and/or \"displaying or transmitting Content that questions the impartiality of or otherwise denigrates a Major League umpire.\" Chisholm's post certainly seems to fit the bill.\n\nChisholm, 27, entered Thursday hitting .176/.273/.471 (112 OPS+) with six home runs and four stolen bases. His contributions have been worth an estimated 1.0 Win Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference. Obtained in a trade last summer with the Miami Marlins, Chisholm is a former All-Star who has averaged 3.2 WAR per 162 games for his career, making him a well-above-average player capable of contributing both power and speed.\n\nThe Yankees, following Thursday's win, are now 12-7 on the young season. With the Toronto Blue Jays enjoying a day off, the Yankees have now extended their lead in the American League East to a full game."

            "content": "BOSTON (AP) — The Boston Marathon and Mayor Michelle Wu insisted on Friday that international runners and other foreign visitors remain welcome in the city and said there is no evidence that travel for this year’s race has fallen off in the face of increased border scrutiny.\n\n“Regardless of what’s happening at other levels, and particularly now at the federal level, in Boston we welcome everyone,” Wu said at a public safety media briefing not far from the finish line. “We seek to be a home for everyone.”\n\nA cherished event for runners and spectators alike, staged on the state holiday of Patriots’ Day commemorating the battles of Lexington and Concord that sparked the American Revolution 250 years ago, the Boston Marathon is the world’s oldest and most prestigious annual 26.2-mile race.\n\nIt has taken on even greater significance — and popularity — since 2013, when two pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line, killing three people and wounding hundreds more. (Allen Davis, the assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston office, said at the briefing that there were “no credible or specific threats” to Monday’s race.)\n\nThis year’s marathon has more than 30,000 entrants from 128 countries. Boston Athletic Association President Jack Fleming said the 129th edition of the race was full — thousands more are turned away — and there’s been no indication that those registered are staying home.\n\n“We have a lot of demand this year, as we do every year,” he said.\n\nBut as U.S. officials track plummeting tourism numbers, with many would-be visitors angered by President Donald Trumps’ tariffs and rhetoric and alarmed by stories about tourists being arrested at the border, reports say at least some potential marathon attendees have decided to skip the race.\n\nCanadians have been especially put off by Trump’s talk of making the country the 51st U.S. state. Paula Roberts-Banks, a writer and photographer from Rosseau, Ontario, who has run Boston 12 times, wrote in Canadian Running magazine that she earned a coveted bib for this year’s race but decided not to run because she has “soured” on the U.S.\n\n“I simply don’t want to go there,” she said. “It feels like a breakup.”\n\nBritish runner Calli Hauger-Thackery, a 2024 Olympian who is entered in the women’s professional field, said she has never experienced a problem coming to the U.S. but she worries now that that might change.\n\n“It does scare me traveling a little bit, at the moment,” she said, adding that she is married to an American and has a visa. “I hope it’s enough for them to not flag me or anything coming in and out of the States.”\n\nMost of the 31,941 entrants in Monday’s race were required to qualify at another marathon, and many of them view running Boston as a lifelong athletic goal. Still, about 10% of the field typically does not toe the starting line in Hopkinton for reasons that range from injuries to weather to the 2010 eruption of a volcano in Iceland that halted flights and prevented hundreds of Europeans from traveling to Boston.\n\nIn last year’s field of 29,333 entrants, there were 2,838 who failed to start. Race officials say they will not know how many no-shows there are this year until Monday; even then, they won’t know why.\n\n“We do not have data as to why people may or may not be coming to Boston,” Fleming said. “At the BAA, our goal is to create a marathon experience that is very welcoming and joyous. Every year, we focus on that goal and we are confident that we have done everything in our power to achieve that this year.”\n\nWu said she hoped visitors would look past the geopolitical climate and “participate in this very, very important global tradition that should transcend politics and should transcend the issues of the day.”\n\nAnd that’s just what Australian Patrick Tiernan plans to do.\n\n“There are some unfortunate situations going on in the U.S. right now, but I don’t think that should have to taint what’s happening here, and the history of this race,” said the two-time Olympian, who was an NCAA cross country champion at Villanova. “I think everybody’s very excited to be here and excited to compete on Monday.”\n\n___\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports"

            "content": "San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich is doing well at home after needing medical attention earlier this week following an incident at a restaurant, a person with knowledge of the matter told The Associated Press on Friday.\n\nThe 76-year-old Popovich, who missed most of this season while recovering from what the Spurs called a mild stroke, was at a restaurant in San Antonio on Tuesday night when he began not feeling well, said the person, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because neither Popovich nor the team released any details publicly.\n\nTMZ Sports, which first reported the story, obtained video footage of what it said was Popovich being wheeled away from the restaurant on a stretcher and loaded into the back of an ambulance. TMZ said rescue officials were called by someone reporting that a person fainted in the restaurant.\n\nPopovich had a stroke at the team’s arena in San Antonio on Nov. 2. Assistant coach Mitch Johnson took over as acting head coach that night and wound up coaching the team’s final 77 games of the season.\n\nPopovich was in regular contact with Johnson and often in the facility, even addressing the team on at least one occasion in February. Popovich, at that time, said he hopes he can “return to coaching in the future.”\n\nThe Spurs have not given any indication if Popovich plans to be back in time for the start of next season. He is under contract with the team through the 2027-28 season.\n\nPopovich is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, has led the Spurs to five NBA championships and guided USA Basketball to an Olympic gold medal at the Tokyo Games in 2021. He’s the all-time wins leader in NBA history and one of only three coaches to win the NBA coach of the year award three times, Don Nelson and Pat Riley being the others.\n\nHis tenure with the Spurs goes back to 1988 when he joined the club as an assistant coach. He left in 1992 and returned May 31, 1994, as executive vice president for basketball operations and general manager.\n\nHe fired Bob Hill and appointed himself coach on Dec. 10, 1996, holding that title ever since.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA"

            "content": "CRANBERRY, Pa. -- Sidney Crosby walked into an empty locker room Friday.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins captain came to grab some things, say a few goodbyes and head into another long offseason.\n\nA few years ago, it would have been an odd scene. Missing the Stanley Cup Playoffs rarely was considered during a streak of 16 straight appearances from 2007-22.\n\nNow, the Penguins will sit out a third straight postseason. Crosby wants it to end.\n\n\"It's difficult when you're cleaning out your locker and stall and you're just thinking [about] how fun it is to play in the playoffs,\" Crosby said. \"How important that is and how much work everyone puts into trying to make that happen. It's not a fun feeling when other teams are playing and you're going home.\"\n\nAt age 37, Crosby continues to do his part, leading Pittsburgh with 91 points (33 goals, 58 assists) in 80 games. He averaged at least 1.00 points per game for a 20th season, passing Wayne Gretzky (19) for the most in NHL history, and reached 90 points in a third straight season for the first time.\n\nBut there's urgency.\n\nThe Penguins haven't won a postseason series since 2018. Crosby, who will turn 38 on Aug. 7, is the youngest of a core trio including center Evgeni Malkin and defenseman Kris Letang.\n\nMalkin will be 39 years old on July 31 and will be going into the final season of a four-year, $24.4 million contract ($6.1 million average annual value) signed July 12, 2022. He had 50 points (16 goals, 34 assists) in 68 games.\n\nLetang will turn 38 on April 24. He had surgery this week to close a small hole in the wall of his heart and finished the season with 30 points (nine goals, 21 assists) in 74 games, his lowest total since 2013-14 when he had 22 points (11 goals, 11 assists) in 37 games.\n\nCrosby, Malkin and Letang have won the Stanley Cup three times (2009, 2016, 2017).\n\nThey've pushed for a fourth. Time won't stop. At some point, they won't be around.\n\n\"Missing the playoffs the last few years, I think there's always going to be thoughts and opinions,\" Crosby said. \"We've got to prove it. I think that we've got to find a way to get back there. ... When you lose, you're going to hear that. That's part of it. That's part of what [stings] about losing. But yeah, it's up to us to find a way to get back there.\"\n\nCrosby knows how it feels to lift the Cup. Erik Karlsson hasn't gotten to that point yet.\n\nThe 34-year-old defenseman was acquired from the San Jose Sharks in a three-team trade involving the Montreal Canadiens on Aug. 6, 2023. At the time, he said Pittsburgh provided his best chance of winning the Stanley Cup for the first time.\n\nIn two seasons, Karlsson has led Penguins defensemen with 109 points (22 goals, 87 assists) in 164 games but has missed the playoffs twice. His desire for a championship hasn't changed.\n\n\"It's still at the same level,\" Karlsson said. “Obviously I love being here and I've enjoyed my time here on a personal level. There's zero complaints, obviously.\"\n\nKarlsson, who has two seasons left on an eight-year, $92 million contract ($11.5 million AAV), would like to remain in Pittsburgh. He also knows it might not be his decision.\n\n\"I've been in this situation before and been through this before,\" Karlsson said. \"I realize the magnitude of it. At the end of the day, it's a business. Whatever happens is going to happen. But all I can say is I've enjoyed everything here. I enjoy [it] on a personal level. Me and my family really want it to work here.\"\n\nChange has been constant since Kyle Dubas was hired as general manager and president of hockey operations June 1, 2023.\n\nThe prospect pool was retooled. Rutger McGroarty, acquired in a trade from the Winnipeg Jets on Aug. 22, and Ville Koivunen, acquired in a trade that sent Jake Guentzel to the Carolina Hurricanes on March 7, 2024, provided evidence after the rookie forwards were recalled from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League on March 28.\n\nIn the next three years at the NHL Draft, Pittsburgh has 30 picks, including four in the first round and 18 in the first three.\n\n\"The opportunity to leverage those prospects and draft capital that [Dubas has] acquired to potentially help our team in the near future is a real possibility,\" coach Mike Sullivan said. \"So I know that those are Kyle's intentions. Obviously, would we like to return this team to contention when that window still exists, when we still have, in particular, our captain that's still playing at such an elite level? I know those are Kyle's intentions. They're certainly his aspirations.\"\n\nSullivan plans to oversee it in what would be his 11th season with Pittsburgh.\n\n\"My intentions are to be the head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins,\" he said.\n\nIn some ways, next season should look familiar. Sullivan was hired Dec. 12, 2015. Crosby was a rookie in 2005-06 before Malkin and Letang joined the following season.\n\n\"I guess it is on the back of your mind that these guys who have been here, and they carry the torch, that time is undefeated,\" said forward Bryan Rust, who had an NHL career-high 31 goals in his 11th season. \"I think all good things come to an end. But don't think we're quite there yet. So we've got time, and obviously we want to make the most of it, especially with these franchise guys who have been here for so long.\"\n\nEven they can't rest though. Not with the intention of being part of that next run.\n\n\"You know what? Regardless of your age, you have to prove yourself,\" Crosby said. \"If there's a lot of healthy competition, I think that's better for us. That means that there's tough decisions that have to be made. So if you have a good team, I think that's what you're looking at.\""

            "source": "Field Gulls",
            "description": "There’s a local option to consider and a name we’ve not really discussed much as far as a possible Day 2 option at WR for the Seahawks.",
            "content": "By this time next Friday, the Seattle Seahawks will just about own the podium for Day 2 of the 2025 NFL Draft in Green Bay. They have a pair of second-rounders and a pair of third-rounders as a result of the DK Metcalf and Geno Smith trades, so there is much intrigue seeing what Seattle could pull off in the meat of the draft.\n\nLongtime NFL Network draft analyst and former NFL scout Daniel Jeremiah held a media conference call on Friday. Field Gulls was the only Seattle Seahawks representation out of the roughly 100 reporters and writers in attendance. In the interest of transparency and completeness, here’s my full question and his response. Some of the transcription is edited for clarity. We were only permitted one question and my focus was on Seattle’s wide receiver situation.\n\nField Gulls: “Last time we did this conference call before the NFL Combine and the Seahawks still had DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett on the roster and they also had Geno Smith, but all of them are gone and the Seahawks have since signed Sam Darnold in free agency and then from a wide receiver standpoint, they signed Cooper Kupp and Marquez Valdes-Scantling in free agency.\n\nSo my question to you: Seattle’s only receivers under contract through 2026 are Kupp and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Are there any receivers from this class, particularly ones in that Day 1/Day 2 projected range, who stand out to you as potential fits and draft targets for Seattle’s offense? Or, alternatively, could you see Seattle making a play for a major receiving TE like Colston Loveland or Elijah Arroyo or Mason Taylor?\n\nDaniel Jeremiah: “With where they’re picking [at No. 18], if one of those top two tight ends [Tyler Warren or Colston Loveland] were to get there, I think I would have a hard time passing on them just for the value that they represent.\n\n“If I was building out this team, where would you feel that they need to go? To me, interior offensive line early would be more of a focus if I’m just looking at it and I want to feel comfortable. I look at Grey Zabel, if he was there, I think he would be a great fit. Not only can he come in and start right away, he’s going to allow you to get your best five guys on the field because of his versatility. So you get injuries throughout a season, I think that would be a valuable chess piece for them.\n\n“I would be more inclined—if you’re gonna look at a receiver for them, when you’re looking at 50 and 52, that would probably be more the range I’d be looking to address that room, and I think there’ll be good value there with some really solid options.\n\n“I love Jack Bech [from TCU], there are people who have compared him to Cooper Kupp because of just the toughness and all of that. I think that’s the competitive side of that comparison. I get someone who could play over the top as well and go get the ball. I think he would be a fun one to add to their mix. I’m looking more for guys that are going to play on the outside so Jack Bech would be one.\n\n“Tori Horton from Colorado State would be another one who can get down the field and is a home run hitter who also has some big time punt return value. You’ve just got to go back to 2023 to watch; he just wasn’t healthy at all this year.\n\n“And Kyle Williams from Washington State. That would not be a long drive and that would be a big impact—he’s a really, really good player.\n\n“This is why I love doing this call because you start thinking about teams outside of the first round and who could match their needs. And I think the Seattle receiver need marries up really well with where they’re located in the second round.”\n\nObviously none of these players is a Day 1 target, which is fine because it’s more likely than not that Seattle would look to address WR on Day 2. I want to focus on Tori Horton a bit because we have not addressed him on this site at all. Williams had a pre-draft visit with the Seahawks and Bech has been a marginally popular name to link to Seattle in mock drafts, particularly after his emotional and awesome Senior Bowl.\n\nHorton is listed at 6’ 2 1/2’’ and 196 lbs with a 30 1/8” arms and 9” hands. At the NFL Scouting Combine, Horton put up a 4.41-second 40-yard dash with a 1.53-second 10-yard split, as well as a vertical jump of 37.5”. He’s a tall player without being a big-bodied target like DK Metcalf or Tee Higgins, but he’s not meant to be like them. Unlike Williams and Bech, Horton is more likely to be at most a third-round pick than second-rounder, although his season-ending knee injury in 2024 likely impacted his draft stock more than anything else. He’s also still 22 years old despite being in college for five seasons between CSU and Nevada, so he’s not an older prospect.\n\nHere’s what The Athletic’s Dane Brugler has to say about Horton:\n\nA two-year starter at Colorado State, Horton was primarily an outside receiver (on the right side of the formation) in Jay Norvell’s version of the Air Raid. After ranking top five in the FBS in catches (96) and first-down grabs (57) in 2023, he returned for his “super senior” season in 2024 but played in just five games because of a right knee injury — and fell 35 receiving yards shy of the Mountain West career record. However, he will continue Colorado State’s impressive run of producing pass-catching draft picks (Trey McBride, Olabisi Johnson, Michael Gallup, Rashard Higgins). Horton is field-fast and flashes an explosive gear on downfield and crossing routes (33 combined catches of 20 yards or more over the 2022-23 seasons, seventh most in FBS). His ball skills and route timing can be disrupted by physical defensive backs, but his vertical speed will also open up comebacks, digs and underneath runways. Overall, Horton must tighten his route running and get stronger, but his fluidity, speed and natural tracking skills can be weaponized by the right coaching staff. He projects as a rotational Z receiver/punt returner who can gradually push for starting flanker reps.\n\nI should also note that Horton, whom Jeremiah touted for his punt return skills, returned a punt for a touchdown in each of his three seasons at CSU. That might be very relevant to the Seahawks as they look for punt returner options this season after the disaster that was 2024.\n\nTake a look at his 2023 highlights in this compilation video below.\n\nWhich of these three receivers interests you the most as a potential Seahawks fit? Let us know in the comments section! And a special thanks to Daniel Jeremiah for once again answering a Field Gulls question."

The family owns the Salt Lake Bees, the Triple-A baseball affiliate for the Los Angeles Angels. LHM just opened a new stadium for the organization in Daybreak earlier this month. Larry H. Miller Co. is also working to bring a Major League Baseball club to the Power District in Salt Lake City, having already secured funding for a professional stadium in the event MLB awards them a team.\n\nBut the acquisition of RSL and the Royals will put the Millers back in control of a major league team.\n\n“We are humbled again by this opportunity to become stewards of these franchises; to build on the strong foundation of the legacy that has been built over these decades,” LHM CEO Steve Starks said.\n\n(Bethany Baker | The Salt Lake Tribune) Steve Starks, the CEO of the Larry H.

Miller owned the Utah Jazz for more than 30 years, dating back to the 1980s. Miller died in 2009, leaving his wife, Gail Miller, and their children to take over the family business and the NBA organization.\n\nThe Millers ultimately sold the Jazz to the Smith Entertainment Group in 2020.\n\n“Gail Miller is not just the matriarch of this family. She’s the matriarch of this state,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said. “When the history of sport in Utah is written, half the book is going to be about the Miller family.

He’d cleared waivers after being designated for assignment a week ago, briefly elected free agency, and returned on another minor league deal. He’s now right back in the big leagues. Righty Troy Taylor was optioned to Tacoma in his place.\n\nThis marks the latest stop in a frequent matchup between Lawrence and the Mariners. Seattle originally claimed the righty off waivers back in 2017, and while he’s bounced around the league at times, he’s repeatedly made his way back to the M’s, signing a quartet of minor league deals and pitching for them in parts of three different seasons. Lawrence also spent the entire 2024 campaign in the Mariners organization, though he wasn’t brought up from Triple-A Tacoma at any point last season.\n\nIn 127 major league innings between the Blue Jays, Mariners and Cardinals, Lawrence has pitched to a 6.73 ERA with a 16.6% strikeout rate and an 8.5% walk rate. He’s also pitched in parts of 10 Triple-A seasons, working to a 4.32 ERA in 733 frames at the top minor league level.\n\nIt could very well be another short stint for Lawrence, who seems amenable to serving as a depth arm with the Mariners and riding the DFA carousel for the time being. He’ll give Seattle a fresh arm after a wild, back-and-forth extra-innings game saw the Mariners burn through seven relievers en route to a victory over the Reds yesterday. Each of Andres Munoz, Trent Thornton, Gabe Speier and Carlos Vargas has now pitched on back-to-back days, so Lawrence has a good chance at getting into tonight’s series opener in Toronto."

Because we know you aren’t close to being tired of debating mock drafts yet, let’s check his haul for the New York Giants.\n\nRound 1 (No. 3) — Abdul Carter, edge, Penn State\n\nReuter says:\n\nYes, the Giants already employ pass rushers ﻿﻿﻿Brian Burns﻿﻿﻿ and ﻿﻿﻿Kayvon Thibodeaux﻿﻿﻿ (who, it should be noted, missed five games in 2024) — but Carter would be quite the fill-in for ﻿﻿﻿Azeez Ojulari﻿﻿﻿ after Ojulari’s departure via free agency. Carter also has the versatility to play off the ball if the team wants to get him on the field more regularly.\n\nValentine’s View: Increasingly, it looks like this is what will happen. I have zero issues with it. A game-changing defensive player who might be the No. 1 overall player in the draft? Yes, please.\n\nRound 2 (No. 34) — Grey Zabel, C-G, North Dakota State\n\nReuter gave the Browns Jalen Milroe at No. 33. The knee-jerk reaction would be to take Louisville quarterback Tyler Shough here. Reuter resists, and takes Zabel.\n\nI may have snagged Shough and been done with the quarterback conundrum, but it’s hard to kick about grabbing a player at a position of need many think will be selected in Round 1.\n\nRound 3 (No. 65) — Tyler Shough, QB, Louisville\n\nSome believe Shough could be a Round 1 pick. Others think he could fall even further than this. I would be thrilled to get a guy who has the potential to become a quality starter at this point in the draft.\n\nRound 3 (No. 99) — Cam Skattebo, RB, Arizona State\n\nWith all of the attention the Giants have paid to running back, selecting one somewhere in the middle of the draft won’t be a surprise. Skattebo brings toughness and attitude the Giants could use.\n\nRound 4 (No. 105) — Ty Robinson, DT, Nebraska\n\nThis is just one of those guys that the more you watch, the more enamored you get. At least, that’s the case for me. He plays with power and passion. He doesn’t look like a guy who should make some of the plays he makes, but he keeps making them. I would be happy to see Robinson land with the Giants.\n\nRound 5 (No. 154) — Andre Mukuba, S, Texas\n\nThe Giants have Jevon Holland and Tyler Nubin at safety. What is backing them up, though, is nothing to get excited about. I like adding competition to that group. Dane Brugler of The Athletic has Mukuba graded as a Round 3-4 selection, so by that standard this is excellent value.\n\nRound 7 (No. 219) — Roc Taylor, WR, Memphis\n\nHonestly, this is not a player I have studied. I do like adding competition at wide receiver, though. Taylor is 6’2, 213 pounds. Brugler has him graded as a priority free agent.\n\nRound 7 (No. 246) — Esa Pole, OT, Washington State\n\nAnother player I have not studied. I have zero issue, though, with the selection of a developmental offensive lineman at this point. Brugler has the 6’5¼, 323-pound Pole graded as a Round 6-7 prospect. He says:\n\nA former basketball player, Pole moves with light feet for a human his size. That talent is evident in pass protection, an area in which he took a major jump between his junior and senior seasons. He shows the basic understanding of how to use his hands in all areas, but the muscle memory is still new as he figures out how to counter or recover from compromised situations. Overall, Pole is still very much a work in progress and needs to bank valuable experience. At the end of the day, though, nimble athletes with his size and strength are tough to find. He is worth a draft pick as a developmental option and practice squad candidate.\n\nPole was a left tackle at Washington State."

            "content": "TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.\n\nMike Sullivan understands he is not above the speculation regarding his future that also will soon encircle several of his players.\n\nThat the Pittsburgh Penguins have missed the postseason for the third consecutive time on his watch is sure to amplify the chatter.\n\nBut on the first day of the Penguins’ offseason Friday, Sullivan made clear his own plans moving forward as it pertains to his current position.\n\n“My intentions are to be the head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins,” Sullivan said at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex as his club conducted its annual end-of-season locker cleanout.\n\nSullivan, 57, has coached the Penguins since December 2015.\n\nHe just completed the first year of a three-year contract extension through 2026-27.\n\nInjury updates\n\nSullivan indicated that the Penguins are not anticipating any of their injured players to require offseason surgery.\n\n“We expect that they will all recover in a timely fashion,” he said.\n\nIncluded on the list of players who began the offseason with various injuries are forwards Tommy Novak, Matt Nieto, Noel Acciari, Boko Imama, Kevin Hayes, Blake Lizotte and Rutger McGroarty, plus defensemen Kris Letang and P.O Joseph.\n\nSidelined for the final three games of the season, Acciari told reporters Friday that was dealing with a hip injury.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who played his final game of the year April 8, is hopeful that, via rehabilitation this summer, he can avoid surgery.\n\n“Just was dealing with multiple tears in the abductor/hip area,” Acciari said. “Just thought at the time of the season, maybe try to shut it down and let it heal and kind of build that back up. And be ready for next year.\n\n“Hoping that with time, we can avoid (surgery). But if it doesn’t heal, it’s something that a little surgery might (be needed) to fix that. Just rehabbing with the training staff right now and just trying to strengthen that up and avoid all that.”\n\nLike Acciari, an ailment ended Lizotte’s campaign in early April.\n\nHowever, Lizotte, 27, indicated that a return to action could have been in the cards, were the Penguins’ circumstances different at the moment.\n\n“If we were in the playoffs, starting in a few days, I would be pretty close to returning,” he said. “So, hopefully, get fully healthy, get cleared and have a good offseason.”\n\nRegarding McGroarty, Sullivan notably said shortly after the 21-year-old suffered a foot injury April 8 vs. the Chicago Blackhawks that he could be available for Wilkes-Barre/Scranton’s Calder Cup postseason run.\n\nOn Friday, the Penguins reassigned six players to the American Hockey League for that purpose (wingers Ville Koivunen, Vasily Ponomarev, Valtteri Puustinen and Joona Koppanen plus defenseman Filip Kral) but McGroarty, still on the mend, was not among them.\n\nMcGroarty suiting up again in 2024-25 could be contingent on how deep the AHL Penguins advance into the postseason.\n\nThat said, during his end-of-year chat with reporters, McGroarty was notably not wearing a boot cast on his foot.\n\nWhether he is able to rejoin his teammates remains to be seen.\n\n“The doctors have done a great job of setting a plan, and I feel like the plan is going well right now,” McGroarty said. “I wouldn’t say I’m further along or set back in any way, but I would say the plan’s going great right now.”\n\nNo specific end-of-season update was offered on Novak, who, post-trade from the Nashville Predators on March 5, was limited to only two contests in a Penguins sweater.\n\nHayes and Nieto also ended the season with unspecified injuries. Joseph missed the team’s final 20 games after suffering an injury March 1 vs. the Boston Bruins.\n\nImama is recovering from surgery to repair a biceps injury suffered March 29. Letang underwent patent foramen ovale surgery to close a small hole in his heart March 15 and will be recovering for the next four to six weeks.\n\nWorld Championship participants\n\nThe 2025 International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) World Championships is set for May 9-25 in Stockholm, Sweden, and Herning, Denmark.\n\nWith their calendars cleared, several Penguins players expressed interest in the event.\n\nGranted, it was noted that roster construction conversations have not heated up yet.\n\nAnd a few players, such as wingers Bryan Rust and Rickard Rakell plus goalie Tristan Jarry, are expecting newborn children with their wives this month, definitively (Rust, Rakell) or likely (Jarry) ruling them out.\n\nNetminder Alex Nedeljkovic, a native of Parma, Ohio, who represented the United States at the 2024 World Championship, was receptive.\n\n“I haven’t been contacted or anything like that,” he said. “It’s always a privilege to represent your country at any level. We’ll see. Phone is open. But I haven’t heard anything.”\n\nDefenseman Matt Grzelcyk, who hails from Charlestown, Mass., expressed similar sentiments.\n\n“I haven’t heard,” he said. “Something I’d be definitely open for. To play on that stage would be amazing.”\n\nDefenseman Erik Karlsson is prioritizing being at full health this offseason but is keeping the door open to appear in the tournament primarily hosted by his home country.\n\nPenguins captain Sidney Crosby is in a similar boat.\n\nCrosby, who, along with Karlsson, played in the 4 Nations Face-Off in February, is holding off for a bit before relaying a decision to Canada general manager Kyle Dubas.\n\n“I’ll take some time here and see,” Crosby said. “But I told Kyle I’ll try to let him know as soon as possible.”"

            "content": "The Colorado Buffaloes have decided to immediately retire the numbers of quarterback Shedeur Sanders (2) and cornerback/receiver Travis Hunter (12). It hasn’t been as readily accepted as the program may have expected.\n\nThe Associated Press recently took a look at the unexpected controversy.\n\nFor instance, Colorado Hall of Fame linebacker Chad Brown voiced his opposition to the decision on social media: “If the players from the National Champ team have not received such an honor, by default, this action dismisses, diminishes & for a new generation of CU fans erases their greatness. I would never minimize the impact of #2 or #12, they are amazing players. But this timing is poor.”\n\nFormer Colorado offensive lineman Tyler Polumbus said this, also on social media: “The vitriol from former players regarding CU retiring #2 is loud. I think most (including myself) believe he deserves the honor... eventually... Soo many all time greats that deserve the honor and have waited their turn. Why so fast? Zero waiting period? Feels like the first blunder of the Coach Prime era that has upset alumni.”\n\nColorado coach Deion Sanders, Shedeur’s father, acknowledged that he has never before witnessed pushback to a jersey-retirement decision.\n\n“This is the first time I ever seen it sore,” Deion said. “I don’t know if you know it, but I think every jersey I darn near played in is retired. So I’m pretty familiar with this. It’s never been sore.”\n\nSaid Deion regarding the decision to retire the number worn by his son, who amassed a record of 13-12 in two seasons with Colorado: “We’re talking about Shedeur. We ain’t talking about nobody else. If his last name wasn’t Sanders, we wouldn’t have this discussion.” (Deion possibly doesn’t realize how accurate that is, but not in the way he intended.)\n\nAthletic director Rick George also defended the move. “Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders are both great Buffs and exceptional talents who have been tremendous representatives of our program and of our university and led our team back to national prominence,” George said. “Recognizing the accomplishments of a Heisman Trophy winner and record-setting quarterback who ushered in this new era of CU football now does not detract from accomplishments of the past. Rather, it adds to the rich legacy of CU football that has been passed down over the years by everyone who has worn a CU uniform.”\n\nGeorge has to say it, because he basically works for Deion at this point. And that’s fine. They’re saying what they have to say to deal with a decision that didn’t go the way they expected.\n\nIt’s too late to abandon ship. Unless Shedeur and Hunter would choose to decline the honor. That’s the only way out of a mess that will otherwise require Colorado to overcompensate by retiring more numbers, quickly."

            "content": "Wout van Aert admitted that Remco Evenepoel was simply stronger and faster in the final hour of De Brabantse Pijl, and that he lacked the speed and power to match Evenepoel's determination and long sprint after the climb to Overijse.\n\nVan Aert has still to win a race in 2025 and has struggled to be competitive in the cobbled Classics, finishing fourth at the Tour of Flanders and at Paris-Roubaix. He arguably 'needed' the victory more than Evenepoel but could only hug his fellow Belgian beyond the finish line and accept defeat.\n\n\"Of course I had hoped to win and especially in this situation, where we were going to the finish line for a sprint,” Van Aert said in the Dutch post-race interview.\n\n“But I had nothing left. Remco slowly killed me in the last hour. It was already hard to hang on in the last lap. I was actually already at the limit when we started the sprint.\"\n\nVan Aert went on the attack after Visma-Lease a Bike teammate Tiesj Benoot set an infernal pace with 55km to race, on the Hertstraat, the first of three painful climbs on the 19.8km finishing circuit.\n\nEvenepoel joined him and they used the Moskesstraat and Holstheide to build their lead to over 30 seconds. Britain's Joe Blackmore (Israel-Premier Tech) managed to join them but was dispatched by an Evenepoel surge on the final climb of the cobbled Hertstraat climb.\n\n\"I felt good and helped break the race open.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"For me it would have been better if there were a few more riders, because it was not easy to ride in Remco's wheel.\n\n\"I hoped that he would slow after the last climb so that we would have an explosive sprint but Remco kept riding and so it became a fairly long effort.\"\n\nVan Aert opted to train at altitude in March, missing a stage race and Milan-San Remo. He was second Dwars door Vlaanderen, a combative fourth at the Tour of Flanders, fourth at Paris-Roubaix after an early crash and now second again at De Brabantse Pijl.\n\nThey are good results but not by Van Aert's usual high standards. He has only Sunday's Amstel Gold race to win a spring Classic before heading to the Giro d'Italia and then the Tour de France in search of stage victories.\n\nHowever, Van Aert now has doubts about his sprint, which has won him so much in the past.\n\n\"I'm not too disappointed, even if we were aiming for more,\" he said. \"In this situation, I had hoped to beat him in the sprint, but apparently I don't have a sprint anymore.\n\n\"I'd like to know the answer to the question why my sprint didn't come out this spring. It's not that we worked differently.\n\n\"It's something we have to look at, I have no idea. The only explanation I see today is that I suffered in the last kilometres and was already above the limit when I went into the sprint.\"\n\nSubscribe to Cyclingnews for unlimited access to our 2025 Spring Classics coverage.

The game will broadcast live on ESPN.\n\nThe Grizzlies are 5.5-point favorites over the Mavericks on the spread (Grizzlies -5.5), with the over/under set at 220.5 total points.

Favorites are also 7-1 straight up and ATS, which leans towards Memphis.\n\nOf course, I’m throwing all that out and going with the Mavericks tonight.\n\nThe key here is Anthony Davis. AD is 16-6 SU against Memphis since being traded to the Lakers. Jaren Jackson Jr. is an all-world defender who is absolutely helpless against Davis.\n\nDavis struggles against bigger, more physical defenders. Zach Edey might have a chance in four years, but with Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively both available, he won’t be guarding AD anyway.\n\nJa Morant is questionable after suffering an ankle injury against the Warriors a few days ago. The Grizzlies are already without their best perimeter defender in Jaylen Wells and their best backup big Brandon Clarke.\n\nScottie Pippen Jr. had a great game against Steph Curry, but will likely struggle against Klay Thompson and the bigger Mavericks guards.\n\nExpect a defensive battle, but for the Mavericks to reach the postseason and put the Grizzlies’ pitiful season out of its misery.\n\nMavericks vs Grizzlies Betting Prediction\n\nMavericks Moneyline (+195)\n\nUnder 220.5 (-110)\n\nMavericks vs Grizzlies Parlay Picks\n\nAnthony Davis Over 39.5 Points + Rebounds\n\nMavericks ML\n\nParlay Payout: +355\n\nMavericks vs Grizzlies Betting Trends\n\n60% of bets and 61% of the money are on the Mavericks to cover the spread\n\n37% of bets and 73% of the money on the moneyline are on the Mavericks to win outright\n\n96% of bets and 96% of the money are on the over Betting trends via our live, updating NBA public betting & money percentages page."

            "content": "Every potential prospect the Chicago Bears could take at #10 overall has been covered, including some surprises. There are the obvious names like Ashton Jeanty, Tyler Warren, Will Campbell, and Mason Graham. Then you have the sleepers like Coleston Loveland, Kelvin Banks, Derrick Harmon, and Mykel Williams. Perhaps not enough people have discussed the possibility that GM Ryan Poles may look to trade down from #10. It is definitely an option. He hasn’t been shy about moving down in the 1st round before. We saw that in 2023.\n\nMany just wonder if any interested parties will be willing to come up. Jordan Reid of ESPN believes there could be. That is especially true if every quarterback is still on the board except Cam Ward or another notable prospect that Chicago may not want.\n\nKeep an eye on the Bears at No. 10 overall; I could see them getting some calls. If the Saints don’t take a QB at No. 9, things could get really interesting from that point on. Yes, teams won’t be scrambling to trade up compared to previous years, but there could be a surprise depending on which of the top prospects are still left on the board.\n\nThe 2025 draft is considered one of those “pick your preference” classes. In other words, team boards will vary much more wildly than in normal years due to the lack of star power. A player one team may not like could be viewed as excellent by another. This is why a trade down is far from impossible.\n\nTwo positions could dictate a Chicago Bears trade down.\n\nOne is an offensive tackle and the other is a cornerback. Why? It is due to the presence of the San Francisco 49ers at #11. Everybody knows left tackle Trent Williams is nearing retirement. They have to find a long-term replacement. Cornerback was also a weak point for them last year. They need help, and there is a reasonable chance all of the top names will be available at #11. That means teams hoping to land someone like Will Johnson or Jahdae Barron would have to get to #10 if they don’t want to risk the 49ers getting one of them. The teams that could be involved are Miami (#13), Arizona (#16), Tampa Bay (#19), Pittsburgh (#21), and Green Bay (#23). It depends on what any of them offer and how far the Chicago Bears are willing to move down."

With the 2025 NFL Draft just days away, Detroit Lions general manager Brad Holmes had his pre-draft press conference this week to help set the table ahead of next weekend.\n\nAnd similarly to Lions coach Dan Campbell, Holmes seems to do his best with telling it like it is with the media.

Triple-A seemingly can’t contain him, as he’s now slashing .283/.433/.585 with four home runs and a pair of stolen bases while hitting the ball harder than anyone in the entire system.\n\nYes, this is all true, but taking an extended look at the optics of the situation pretty much tells you everything you need to know about the timing of his eventual call.\n\nBoston either needed to make it a week ago, or must wait things out until mid-summer.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMajor League Baseball has rules in place that encourage teams to promote prospects early, as the league looks to crack down on manipulating service time. The Red Sox didn’t let that influence their decision over the first few weeks of the season, but now the official date has passed where the club would lose a year on his arbitration if the 20-year-old won 2025 American League Rookie of the Year. It’s not exactly crazy to think Anthony would be in contention if promoted, so the smartest thing to do in their current state is to wait things out — for that reason, and a few more.\n\nRed Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow made an appearance on WEEI’s “Greg Hill Show” on Thursday and explained the club’s decision-making process this way.\n\n“I don’t think we want to waste anything,” Breslow said. “I think what we want to make sure is that when Roman comes to the big leagues, he’s able to step in and be successful — that there is clear opportunity for him to get the runway that he’ll need as a 20-year-old. I think there are still some development opportunities that he is tackling in Worcester right now, but we are really excited about what Roman has done thus far, and what we think he’s capable of.”\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAnthony is currently blocked in the big leagues. Jarren Duran, Ceddanne Rafaela and Wilyer Abreu are the outfield trio in Boston, with the middle man holding a distinct advantage over the rookie due to his insane glove and right-handed bat. It’s not perfect logic, but you can at least see where we’re coming from, right?\n\nNo?\n\nOK, then listen to MassLive’s Chris Cotillo, who on Thursday reported baseball’s top prospect is currently dealing with minor shoulder soreness. The Red Sox will have him back in the field soon, but until then, there’s zero chance he takes on the designated hitter role at the big league level.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox are in town for a four-game series and have a couple of unheralded pitchers slated to take the mound at Fenway Park. Anthony would probably crush them.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBoston already made its bed when it comes to the promising youngster, though.\n\nIt’s extremely unlikely that he debuts anytime soon, so just keep those thoughts on standby until Anthony falls out of contention for individual awards and back into contention for the call. It’s looking like late May or early June, folks."

            "content": "The last time the Chargers were on the field, they were on the wrong end of a blowout against the Texans in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThat result was a disappointing end to Jim Harbaugh’s first season as their head coach, but it did not lead to any desperate swings in free agency. The Chargers plugged holes by signing players like guard Mekhi Becton, running back Najee Harris, wide receiver Mike Williams, and cornerback Donte Jackson while also bringing back edge rusher Khalil Mack, center Bradley Bozeman, and cornerback Elijah Molden.\n\nAt a press conference on Thursday, General Manager Joe Hortiz said he feels that adds up to a “really good job” that frees the team up to approach the draft without any pressing needs that would cause them to deviate from their board.\n\n“You let the board come to you,” Hortiz said, via the team’s website. “You don’t feel the pressure, so to speak, that, ‘Oh we got to address this player, we have to take this position.’ I just don’t feel that way because of the way we have spread ourselves out in free agency and adding to the roster and really completing the roster. I think that’s the goal. You want to put yourself in a position to be go to draft day and say, ‘We can literally let the board come to us. We can take the best player.’”\n\nThe Chargers can let the board with them, but having 10 picks at their disposal also means they will have ammo to use for moves around the board to assure they land the players they want the most."

            "description": "Jonathan Aranda and Kameron Misner headline Friday's top waiver options",
            "content": "Welcome to the Waiver Wire Picks, our daily fantasy baseball article that looks at the best players in baseball that you should be adding to your rosters. We’ll look at the players that are likely to be available in most leagues, as well as some deep league waiver wire options, and we’ll also look at the most added players in fantasy baseball across the major sites, and let you know which players to add, and which players you can leave on the wire.\n\nTop Priority Players to Add\n\nJonathan Aranda (TBR), 1B/2B (45% rostered on Yahoo, 16.6% on ESPN)\n\nLooking at the xwOBA leaderboards on Baseball Savant gives us a tour of some of the best hitters in baseball. Aaron Judge checks in at No. 1. No shocker there. Pete Alonso, who has crushed the ball to start the season, is right behind. Other top sluggers like Fernando Tatis, Shohei Ohtani, and Kyle Schwarber are all in the top 10.\n\nThe big shocker on this list? Aranda. He wasn’t drafted as a starter in most fantasy leagues this offseason, yet he has been as productive as most of the best hitters in the league. He currently sports a .396 batting average, .464 on-base percentage, and .729 slugging percentage while clubbing three home runs.\n\nWhile he’s not going to hit .400 all season, there are plenty of advanced metrics that suggest his production is legit. He’s making some of the best contact in baseball, ranking in the 95th percentile for hard-hit rate and barrel rate and the 98th percentile for average exit velocity. His expected metrics aren’t quite as good as his actual marks, but they still paint him as one of the best hitters in baseball.\n\nAranda has started to gain a little steam for the Rays, but he’s still available in 55% of Yahoo leagues and more than 80% of ESPN leagues. He’s seemingly cemented his spot as the Rays’ everyday first baseman against right-handed pitchers, so he should continue to get plenty of chances to produce. With eligibility at first base and second base on Yahoo, there’s no reason he should still be on the wire anywhere.\n\nKameron Misner (TB), OF (17% Yahoo, 13.6% ESPN)\n\nMisner is another lefty slugger in Tampa Bay who deserves more love in the fantasy community. He’s a power-speed threat who put himself on the radar with a big spring training. He posted a 197 wRC+ with two homers and two steals in his 14 games, which was enough to earn him a job during the regular season.\n\nLike Aranda, Misner has taken that job and run with it. His numbers have somehow improved from spring training, with his wRC+ currently sitting at 233. His underlying Statcast data isn’t quite as good as Aranda’s, but it’s still strong overall: he ranks in the 90th percentile for xSLG and xBA, and he’s in the 81st percentile for xwOBA.\n\nMisner is probably due for some regression moving forward. Specifically, he’s benefited from an inflated .412 BABIP. That said, he’s a plus runner—he ranks in the 81st percentile for sprint speed—so it’s reasonable for him to be better than average in that department.\n\nUltimately, the power and speed potential is too much to pass up if you’re looking for an outfield. Something like 20 homers and 20 steals isn’t out of the question if he continues to play against right-handed pitchers.\n\nYahoo and ESPN Most Added Players\n\nJP Sears and Andre Pallante were both added as streaming options for Thursday’s slate. Sears drew a favorable matchup versus the White Sox and took full advantage, pitching six scoreless innings and earning a win. However, he managed just two strikeouts, so he relied on limiting the damage on balls in play. The White Sox managed just a .158 BABIP in that matchup, but he may not be as fortunate against more competent opponents. His FIP versus Chicago checked in at 3.84, while his xFIP was all the way up at 6.47. His next start is tentatively scheduled for next Tuesday versus the Rangers, and he has plenty of risk in that spot.\n\nPallante’s matchup was against a much tougher opponent in the Mets. The Mets have underperformed relative to expectations this season, but they still possess one of the most dangerous lineups in baseball. Things didn’t go particularly well for Palante, finishing with just two strikeouts and four earned runs across six innings. It lowered his season-long ERA to 3.22, which puts him closer to his xERA (3.80) and FIP (4.30). His next start is scheduled for Wednesday versus the Braves, and he doesn’t need to be rostered for that matchup.\n\nDylan Moore has eligibility at a ton of different positions, making him an interesting bench bat. He can enter your starting lineup whenever one of your regular starters has an off day, which was the case for a lot of different teams on Thursday. Moore added two more hits and a steal Thursday vs. the Reds, bringing him to four homers and four steals for the year. He’s also hitting .333 with a .302 xBA. The power might not be legit—he’s never had more than 12 homers in a major league season—but he can definitely help you in batting average and steals.\n\nTyler Fitzgerald got off to a slow start this season, but he’s starting to heat up. He entered Thursday’s contest vs. the Phillies with multiple hits in four of his past six games. While he only had one hit on Thursday, he made the most of it, launching his second homer of the season. Fitzgerald’s advanced metrics suggest he hasn’t been as good as he looks on paper, but he’s a major speed threat with a bit of pop. He managed 15 homers and 17 steals in just 96 games last season.\n\nGabriel Arias is another utility-type player who is heating up at the dish. Specifically, he had launched homers in three of his past five games entering Thursday’s contest vs. the Orioles. He went hitless in that matchup, but he did manage to swipe his first base of the year. Arias does have some power upside—his swing speed ranks in the 93rd percentile—but the strikeout numbers are downright frightening. There are likely better options out there.\n\nAnother day, another Kyren Paris blurb. Paris continues to lead the list of most-added players on ESPN, and he continues to impress for the Angels. He’s already hit five homers, which is the same number he had in 81 games between the minors and majors last year. He’s also stolen five bases, and he leads all players at second base in ESPN’s Fantasy Player Rater.\n\nGeraldo Perdomo doesn’t profile as much of a power-hitter, but he’s been a contact machine for the Diamondbacks to begin the year. He ranks in the 98th percentile for strikeout rate, 98th percentile for whiff rate, and 90th percentile for chase rate, so he’s showing mastery of the strike zone. He’s also taking plenty of walks, which is a major plus for OBP leagues. He should continue to provide solid contributions in batting average, but he’s more of a one-category contributor than anything else.\n\nPete Crow-Armstrong is somewhat the antithesis of Perdomo. He still has to prove he can consistently hit major league pitching, but he’s generating tons of splash plays. His seven steals are tied for the second-most in baseball, and he’s also added three homers. As long as he doesn’t regress too much at the dish—his .242 xBA puts him in the 45th percentile—he has an outside chance to lead the league in steals.\n\nTwo pitchers round out the list in Tyler Mahle and Shane Baz. Mahle has come flying out of the gates, pitching to a 0.92 ERA with 21 strikeouts through his first 19.2 innings. His last outing was his best of the year, pitching six scoreless innings with nine strikeouts vs. the Angels. He’s proven that he can be relied upon in solid matchups, though Sunday’s showdown with the Dodgers certainly doesn’t qualify.\n\nBaz is much more exciting. The former top prospect has put it all together to start 2025. His 1.83 xERA puts him in the 93rd percentile, and he’s posted some of the best strikeout numbers in baseball. He’s up to No. 42 in the Pitcher List rankings, and he’s approaching “must-start” territory. He’ll square off with the Yankees on Saturday, and if he succeeds in that matchup, don’t be surprised if he moves even further up the rankings.\n\nCategory-Specific Players to Add\n\nPavin Smith (ARI), 1B/OF (9% Yahoo, 5.5% ESPN)\n\nSmith is still widely available across the industry, despite posting some phenomenal numbers to start the year. His batting average is above .400, and he’s added three homers and a steal. Strikeouts remain a huge issue for him, but if he can keep them in check, there’s no reason he can’t post the best numbers of his career. He’s making elite contact when he does put the ball in play, ranking in the 97th percentile in barrel rate. The batting average may not continue—his xBA is more than 100 points lower than his actual mark—but the power production could be legit.\n\nMax Meyer (MIA), SP (45% Yahoo, 24.8% ESPN)\n\nMeyer remains one of the more underrated sources of strikeouts in fantasy. He’s made four starts this season, and he’s had at least seven punchouts in three of them. Overall, he’s averaged more than 10 strikeouts per nine innings. Even if he regresses a bit from an ERA standpoint, he’s worth adding just for his strikeout upside alone.\n\nEmilio Pagán (CIN), RP (38% Yahoo, 10.2% ESPN)\n\nThe Reds’ bullpen looks like a bit of a headache. That’s particularly true now that Alexis Díaz is back in the mix. However, Terry Francona has already stated that Diaz would not be immediately thrust back into the closer role, and he’s looked shaky in his first two appearances. He’s allowed four baserunners in less than two innings of work, so he doesn’t appear to be a factor in the closer conversation for the time being.\n\nThat leaves Pagán and Tony Santillan as the team’s most-trusted relievers. So far, Pagán has gotten the better of the split between the two players. He’s converted four save opportunities, while Santillan has just one. Pagán may not be able to hold down the job all season, but he looks like a decent source of saves for the time being.\n\nStreaming Pitchers\n\nBe sure to check out the great Nick Pollack’s SP Streamer Rankings to see his favorite choices in the opening week. There are plenty of aces scheduled to take the bump on Friday, but there are some solid streamers as well. Nick makes the case for Luis L. Ortiz, but he’s far from the only option:\n\nDavid Peterson (NYM), SP (35% Yahoo, 16.3% ESPN)\n\nThe Mets’ pitching staff has been one of the biggest surprises of the early season. They were expected to be an offense-first squad, but their pitching has been far better than their hitting to start the year. They’re first in the league in team ERA, despite being without one of their best starters in Sean Manaea.\n\nCan they keep it up? That remains to be seen, but there are reasons to believe in Peterson on Friday. The Cardinals have hit the ball well to start the year, but they were an exploitable matchup for southpaws last season. They ranked just 22nd in wRC+ in that split, and they had a below-average walk rate. Walks are Peterson’s biggest bugaboo, so if he can avoid issuing the free passes on Friday, he should be able to put together a solid outing.\n\nSpeculative Adds\n\nDavid Bednar (RP), PIT (34% Yahoo, 28.4% ESPN)\n\nBednar was sent down to the minors after a disastrous first week with the Pirates. However, that was never expected to be a long-term assignment, and he has looked back to his old self in Triple-A. He’s yet to allow an earned run with a 0.77 FIP through five innings, and he’s struck out 12.6 batters per nine innings.\n\nIt should be just a matter of time before he’s back with the big club, and there’s no reason he can’t immediately resume his job as the team’s closer. Dennis Santana has not exactly taken the role and run with it, pitching to a 5.68 xERA with just one save. In deeper leagues, it could be worth trying to get ahead of Bednar’s eventual promotion.\n\nRanger Suárez (PHI), SP (36% Yahoo, 26.0% ESPN)\n\nSuarez has been a quality pitcher for years now, and he’s nearing a return to the active lineup. He made his second rehab start in the minors on Wednesday, tossing four innings while throwing 54 pitches. He’ll likely need another couple of tune-ups before making his MLB debut, but that tentatively puts him on track for early May. If you have an IL spot available, he could be worth stashing until then.\n\nHyeseong Kim (LAD), 2B/SS (11% Yahoo, 2.9% ESPN)\n\nThe Dodgers added Kim this offseason, but they chose to start him in the minor leagues. That’s the kind of depth that this team possesses. However, his time in the big leagues could be coming soon. The Dodgers have struggled massively on defense this season, and Kim would be a major upgrade for them in that department. He’s even seen some time in centerfield in the minors, so he could find opportunities at multiple positions.\n\nThe bigger surprise is what Kim has done with his bat. He’s hit three homers and stolen four bases through 16 games at Triple-A, and he’s posted a 112 wRC+. Facing big league pitching will obviously be a bigger challenge, but Kim may provide some value in deeper formats.\n\nDeep League Players to Watch\n\nCoby Mayo (BAL), 3B (7% Yahoo, 1.7% ESPN)\n\nMayo is one of the top hitting prospects in baseball, and he has nothing left to prove at the minor league level. He launched 25 homers in 93 minor league games last season, and he has four homers in his first 16 games this year.\n\nThe bigger question is when he’ll get his opportunity with the Orioles. That’s still to be determined, but he could be worth stashing in anticipation in deeper formats."

            "description": "The NFL world is waiting to see what happens with these veterans",
            "content": "The NFL Draft is less than a week away, but the actions leading up to the draft have been quiet thus far. Every team has a first-round pick in the common draft era (1967), making the first round even more intriguing.\n\nWhile this isn't the most exciting draft class, teams are at a standstill in terms of how aggressive they will be in the days leading up to the draft. Of course, what plays into the chess game is the status of some of the league's marquee players.\n\nThe league is still waiting on what Aaron Rodgers wants to do and if he'll play quarterback in 2025. Other veterans are also uncertain of their futures as some are awaiting to find homes for 2025 while others need to wait until the draft for contract extensions or trades to pass through.\n\nWith the amount of contract extensions being handed out this offseason to non-quarterbacks, some veterans are awaiting their own payday. Others are wondering whether they'll get that extension from their team or somewhere else, hence why certain trades could impact the early rounds.\n\nThese veterans are expected to have an impact on the first round of the draft, as their fates will likely be determined in the coming days.\n\nThe Bengals are doing their best in trying to keep Hendrickson after landing extensions with Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins earlier this offseason, but haven't landed one with the four-time Pro Bowler and All-Pro from last season.\n\nHendrickson's value has never been higher, especially since he was granted permission to seek a trade. This draft class does have some good defensive linemen, making it interesting to see what the value is for Hendrickson -- plus the massive extension the 30-year-old sack artist will get.\n\nA team in the late first round could give the Bengals the pick they'll seek, putting Hendrickson on a Super Bowl contender. This could be the move that put that championship contender over the top.\n\nUntil the Cowboys hand Parsons that contract extension that will make him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL, the trade speculation will linger. Parsons is heading into that fifth-year option worth $24 million and would be a free agent after this season, so there's pressure to get a deal done.\n\nThe Cowboys could receive a king's ransom if they decided to trade Parsons, changing the entire complexity of the draft with what they would receive and for whatever team Parsons lands on. Trading Parsons could net Dallas multiple first-round picks, including this year's.\n\nAgent's Take: Breaking down Micah Parsons' contract complications, how Cowboys star should proceed in talks Joel Corry\n\nHill has two years remaining on three-year, $90 million deal, yet his offseason has been anything but quiet. Hill initially said he wanted out of Miami at the end of the season, then walked back his comments. There also was the police report that Hill was involved in a domestic dispute with his wife (no charges were filed), adding to more offseason drama that may be too rich for the Dolphins to handle.\n\nHill had a down year by his standards, but the Dolphins could get good capital by moving on and revamping their wide receiver group. Teams likely would rather have Hill than many of the wideouts in this draft.\n\nHow could the Steelers trade Pickens after acquiring DK Metcalf? The pair would be one of the best wide receiver duos in the NFL, yet the Steelers may have had enough of the off-field distractions with Pickens and his frustrations with the offense.\n\nTeams would jump at the opportunity to hone Pickens' talent, especially since he's just 24 years old and has a looming contract extension on the way. The Steelers also trade receivers they don't want to pay, so that gives them even more incentive to trade Pickens.\n\nPerhaps Pickens' future is what Aaron Rodgers is waiting on as well.\n\nAiyuk had his option-bonus guarantee of $22.85 million kick in earlier this month, making it difficult for the 49ers to trade him. The 49ers now owe him even more money as a part of the four-year, $120 million contract he signed prior to the start of last season -- $45 million of which was already guaranteed at signing.\n\nThe 49ers will be on the hook for that $22.85 million no matter what, even if they trade him later in the offseason. The 49ers can, however, prorate the cap hit for that bonus across five seasons, including the void years that are tacked onto the end of Aiyuk's deal.\n\nRegardless of the option bonus, teams will likely call San Francisco on Aiyuk anyway. Remember, Aiyuk tore ligaments in his ACL and MCL last October and there's no timetable for his return. Teams could land Aiyuk at a significantly lower price if the 49ers decide to move on.\n\nThe Dolphins are seeking to move Ramsey after both parties mutually agreed to seek trade options, which is interesting considering he agreed to a three-year, $72.3 million deal last September. Ramsey is 30 years old and is coming off a down year, so a trade for a high draft pick may not be feasible.\n\nTrading for Ramsey could reshape the cornerback market at the top of the draft and where the top players will end up. The cornerbacks in this draft could go later than expected. Ramsey's contract also makes it difficult to move him as well.\n\nAt this point, the Falcons would just be willing to move on from Cousins' four-year, $180 million contract (three years left on the deal). Atlanta could cut Cousins, but the Falcons don't save any money designating him as a pre- or post-June 1 cut -- not to mention the minimum $50 million in dead cap space.\n\nTeams that need a quarterback may still have interest in Cousins, but it all depends where Shedeur Sanders, Jaxson Dart, and Jalen Milroe go in this draft. If there happens to be a run of quarterbacks, the interest will increase with Cousins. The veteran quarterback still has to waive his no-trade clause for a trade to happen, basically allowing Cousins to pick where he goes.\n\nThe Eagles continue to say Goedert is still on their roster right now, but the veteran tight end has one year remaining on his contract and an extension isn't likely. Philadelphia could seek one of the top end tight ends in this draft, which may lead to an eventual Goedert trade for more picks.\n\nGetting a good pick for Goedert (Day 2) is likely for the Eagles, or they could use Goedert to develop his eventual successor in 2025. The Eagles always appear to be one step ahead of the curve, so a Goedert trade wouldn't be surprising.\n\nAlexander has been on the trade block for months, and the Packers appear willing to get a trade done by the draft. Trading Alexander will be difficult, as he's played just 14 of 34 games over the last two seasons and 34 of 68 games over the past four years.\n\nJust 27 years old, Alexander has a lot of talent but those missed games have impacted his trade value. When healthy, Alexander is one of the best cornerbacks in football -- evidenced by his two Pro Bowl and second-team All-Pro selections.\n\nThis all comes down to what the Giants do with the No. 3 overall pick, as New York is in prime position to select Abdul Carter. Perhaps they roll with Thibodeaux with Carter on the defensive front, but the Giants have also paid Brian Burns and Dexter Lawrence.\n\nThibodeaux also has a fifth-year option pending on his rookie contract, which is worth a projected $14.75 million. Are the Giants willing to pay that in 2026, or deal the former top-five pick and get some value for Thibodeaux? Let's see if the Giants select Carter or not.\n\nWith Brock Bowers having arguably the greatest rookie season for a tight end in NFL history, there's little use for the Raiders to keep Mayer around. Mayer is heading into his third season, as the former second-round pick has 48 career catches on just 72 targets over his two seasons.\n\nThe Raiders may not be able to get much for Mayer, but he's proven he can start in the NFL. The Raiders have a generational tight end, making the 23-year-old Mayer expendable.\n\nAaron Rodgers (free agent)\n\nWhile it's unlikely Rodgers signs with the Steelers or Vikings prior to the draft, he would impact any team's future draft plans at quarterback. Teams that don't draft a quarterback in the early rounds may pursue Rodgers after the draft, creating a potential bidding war for the future Hall of Fame quarterback.\n\nIf the Steelers are able to get Shedeur Sanders or any of the top-end quarterbacks, it's fair to wonder where Rodgers goes next -- or if he decides to retire. He can control the narrative if he decides to sign prior to the draft."

            "description": "This 2025 NFL Draft is massively important for a 49ers team looking to renovate its roster. Here are our projected picks.",
            "content": "The year was 1986. The 49ers, a full season removed from a Super Bowl run and no longer the class of a fast-moving league, badly needed a youth infusion. Walsh jettisoned aging stars Fred Dean and Dwight Hicks, and then — seeing a draft relatively short on outstanding players but loaded with serviceable talent — proceeded to revolutionize the league in yet another way.\n\nTalent must be constantly replenished across the entire roster — not just at the positions that seem in most acute need of it. That’s something legendary coach Bill Walsh understood even before the salary cap existed. His dynastic 49ers, who won multiple Super Bowls in the 1980s, looked markedly different each time they hoisted the Lombardi Trophy. And it was their roster’s third incarnation, which would win repeat titles to close the decade, that became a renowned showcase of savvy drafting.\n\nFootball is a young man’s sport featuring large rosters in a salary-capped league. Those are inescapable realities that the 49ers face entering this critical 2025 NFL Draft, where they own 11 picks — the most in the league.\n\nWalsh’s 1986 draft placed big bets on upside and heavy trust on the abilities of the 49ers’ assistant coaches to develop players. “Don’t worry, I’ll make him play the run,” DB coach Ray Rhodes told Walsh of third-round pick Tim McKyer, a cornerback who covered well but wasn’t a good tackler in college. The 49ers’ haul was wildly successful. It yielded the likes of Tom Rathman, John Taylor, Steve Wallace, Kevin Fagan, Larry Roberts and Don Griffin. Eight of the 49ers’ first nine picks played at least seven years in the NFL. Five became Pro Bowlers and one ended up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. That was defensive end Charles Haley, one of the 49ers’ three fourth-round picks in 1986.\n\nWalsh made a staggering six trades, mostly to replace higher draft picks with more selections in the lower rounds. In his biography on Walsh, titled “The Genius”, David Harris wrote that “come draft day, the second floor at Forty Niners headquarters took on the air of a commodities market.” When the wheeling and dealing was done, the 49ers no longer owned their first-round pick, but they held 13 total selections including three in both the third and fourth rounds.\n\nLike 1986, this 2025 draft looks deep but not top heavy. However, it doesn’t seem that the 49ers will be able to trade down nearly as much simply because many other teams will likely have similar ideas. Walsh was unique in his thinking at the time, but the league has followed suit in the four decades since.\n\nThe good news for the 49ers: They’ve done well to hoard picks, both through trades (Deebo Samuel and Jordan Mason both netted them fifth-rounders) and the compensatory formula, which has yielded four of their 11 selections. Given the meatiness in the middle of this draft, general manager John Lynch seems especially happy that the 49ers own four of the first 100 picks.\n\nLynch and coach Kyle Shanahan also have fierce trust in the developmental capabilities of their coaching staff, especially now that Robert Saleh is back aboard as defensive coordinator. He and defensive line coach Kris Kocurek were instrumental in building a monstrous front seven about five years ago. It’s fitting that Saleh has returned just as that part of the 49ers defense needs an extensive renovation.\n\nWith all that context in mind, here’s my one and only mock draft of the year (since the draft is famously unpredictable, anything beyond that is excessive guesswork). Consider this, then, to be my well-researched stab at the 49ers’ plans. To avoid rabbit holes, we’ll simply mention some trade possibilities without projecting them:"

            "content": "The Patriots were very bold in NFL free agency, so why not take the same approach to the 2025 draft?\n\nThat was the logic ESPN’s Field Yates employed when he was tasked to propose a late-round trade for either Day 1 or Day 2 of next week’s draft. Yates focused on two teams on the rise and suggested New England trade its No. 38 and No. 77 overall picks to the Washington Commanders in exchange for Nos. 29 and 128.\n\n“A theme of this Patriots offseason has been aggressiveness, as they spent huge in free agency to address several needs,” Yates wrote. “That could continue into the draft, especially if they can fill a critical need with a player late in Round 1. I’d be watching the wide receiver or offensive tackle groups. Washington, meanwhile, has only five picks and would get an earlier opportunity at No. 77 to tap into the depth of this year’s class.”\n\nNew England’s unique spot in the draft might make it more motivated to trade back into Round 1. There are a number of top-tier prospects at premium positions who could help the Patriots, but they might not be worth the fourth overall pick. So, Mike Vrabel and company theoretically could take the best player available at No. 4 and then draft more for need if they traded back into the first round.\n\nWe’ll soon find out if such a move interests the Patriots, as the 2025 draft kicks off next Thursday."

Who are the leaders to be taken by the Green Bay Packers with the 23rd overall pick? We went through 22 recent mock drafts to try to give you that answer.\n\nLet’s begin.\n\nPlayers selected by Packers in 3 mock drafts\n\nJahdae Barron, CB, Texas\n\nDerrick Harmon, DT, Oregon\n\nEmeka Egbuka, WR, Ohio State\n\nAt the moment, the top three candidates, at least based on this recent set of mock drafts, to be the Packers’ first-round pick in 2025 are these three players. Jahdae Barron is a cornerback who might end up playing in the slot at the NFL level, which would make him an interesting match in a room that already features Keisean Nixon and Nate Hobbs. Derrick Harmon is an athletic defensive tackle who is frequently mocked to Green Bay, including in our first three community-voted mock drafts. Emeka Egbuka played in the slot at Ohio State but can play either inside or outside at the next level. He doesn’t have a calling card against man coverage, though, which means the fit is less than snug for a team that is looking to replace Christian Watson.\n\nPlayers selected by Packers in 2 mock drafts\n\nMykel Williams, DE, Georgia\n\nShemar Stewart, DE, Texas A&M\n\nWill Johnson, CB, Michigan\n\nShavon Revel Jr., CB, East Carolina\n\nTetairoa McMillan, WR, Arizona\n\nNone of the names who were mocked to the Packers twice in this batch should be surprises on draft day. Mykel Williams, Shemar Stewart, Shavon Revel Jr. and Tetairoa McMillan all took pre-draft visits to Green Bay, a team that is spending a lot more of these visits on early-round prospects than in previous seasons. The only non-visitor here is Michigan’s Will Johnson, who was once a projected top-five selection but could apparently slide on draft day.\n\nPlayers selected by Packers in 1 mock draft\n\nMaxwell Hairston, CB, Kentucky\n\nKenneth Grant, DT, Michigan\n\nTrey Amos, CB, Ole Miss\n\nJames Pearce Jr., DE, Tennessee\n\nBeyond Michigan defensive tackle Kenneth Grant, the players who received one vote should be viewed as break-in-case-of-emergency selections at #23. With that being said, even though they aren’t considered close to consensus first-round picks, Kentucky cornerback Maxwell Hairston did accept an invite to attend the draft in Green Bay and Ole Miss cornerback Trey Amos took a pre-draft visit with the Packers.\n\nUltimately, these mock drafts collectively had Green Bay taking cornerbacks nine times, wide receivers five times, defensive ends five times and defensive tackles three times. So, beyond NFL teams believing that the Packers’ contract for Hobbs is for him to play in the slot rather than outside cornerback, draft analysts seem to think the same, too."

            "content": "This story is part of a group of stories called\n\nNEW YORK CITY — Cameras surrounded Paige Bueckers as she made her way into the WNBA Draft on Monday. Bueckers, the inevitable No. 1 pick in the draft, was already one of women’s basketball’s biggest names, and fittingly, ESPN projected her Instagram following onto the in-arena jumbotron, which showcased she would immediately be one of the most-followed athletes in the WNBA.\n\nAbout a dozen other women’s college basketball stars also meandered into The Shed in Hudson Yards, the sleek Manhattan building where the draft was held. For the second year in a row, fans could purchase tickets and attend. This year, general admission tickets were going for twice the price, up from $49 to $99.\n\nAmong the stars were Hailey Van Lith, who was accompanied by TCU coach Mark Campbell, her parents, and her boyfriend, Orlando Magic guard Jalen Suggs. Kentucky guard Georgia Amoore, styled by NBA star Russell Westbrook, sat front and center with her family.\n\nThen there was Kiki Iriafen, who arrived with her family, all of whom donned traditional Nigerian attire.\n\n“I wanted to look good, I wanted to feel good,” Iriafen said in her post-Draft interview. “This dress was designed by Nigerian designer Nneka Alexander and I just wanted to show off my culture on this big stage.”\n\nAnd it was worthwhile for Iriafen to wear such a special outfit — because the 2025 WNBA Draft was a massive stage.\n\nThe two-hour program averaged 1.25 million viewers, the league announced, the second-most of any draft in WNBA history.\n\nNo, it didn’t compare to the 2024 WNBA Draft, which Caitlin Clark headlined last spring. That draft saw nearly twice the viewership, averaging 2.4 million viewers, in large part due to Clark’s unprecedented popularity, as well as the myriad of other big names in the class, like Angel Reese and Cameron Brink.\n\nBut 2025 shouldn’t be compared to 2024\n\nFor one, the 2024 Draft came off the heels of a record-breaking championship game between LSU and Iowa.\n\nAnd two, because Clark has already demonstrated she single-handedly uplifts viewership numbers in a way few others have been able to.\n\nSix WNBA networks set ratings records last season — and all six featured games headlined by Clark. Of the top 15 most-viewed games last WNBA season, Clark appeared in 14.\n\nClark’s final three college games — an Elite 8 matchup against LSU, a Final Four matchup against UConn, and a championship game against South Carolina — became the three most-watched women’s college basketball games ever.\n\nSo, there are zero questions about whether women’s basketball receives a massive ratings boost when Clark is involved.\n\nThe question is, what about when she’s not?\n\nAlready, 2025 has shown itself to be an excellent year when it comes to women’s basketball ratings — the 2025 NCAA tournament was the second-most-viewed women’s tournament on record.\n\nAnd, despite quickly turning into a blowout, the national championship game between UConn and South Carolina had the third-highest viewership since ESPN began carrying the tournament in 1996, per ESPN.\n\nThe rise of illegal streaming and potentially inflated Nielsen numbers make cross-era comparisons imperfect, but it’s clear that what’s happened the past two years in women’s basketball is monumental.\n\nThe WNBA Draft saw more viewers than the NHL, MLB\n\nInstead of being compared to the 2025 WNBA Draft, viewership numbers relating to the 2025 WNBA Draft should be compared to other sports.\n\nThe 2024 NHL Draft, for example, averaged 502,000 viewers. More than twice as many people tuned in to watch Bueckers and the rest of the prospects enter than Macklin Celebrini and his class join the NHL.\n\nThe MLB Draft’s first round averaged 863,000 viewers. Baseball — America’s pastime — has been trumped by women’s basketball when it comes to draft night.\n\nBefore 2024, the WNBA Draft never exceeded 601,000 viewers. That number came when Diana Taurasi finished a storied UConn career in 2004.\n\nThese recent numbers are a massive jump from recent years; per The Athletic, in 2020, the WNBA Draft drew 387,000 viewers. In 2021, it drew 331,000 viewers, and in 2022, it drew 403,000 viewers.\n\nThe 2025 #WNBADraft on ESPN delivered the second most-viewed WNBA Draft ever, averaging 1.25M viewers\n\n\n\n1.46M peak\n\nMost-viewed program across ALL TV among M18-34, M18-49 & P18-34\n\nTop cable program among M25-54, P18-49 & P25-54 pic.twitter.com/io5HdjpuSF — ESPN PR (@ESPNPR) April 15, 2025\n\nOn Monday, the WNBA Draft was the most-viewed program across all of television among males 18-49, and all adults 18-34. It also surpassed two other major pro sports.\n\nEven as recent as five years ago, few could have imagined that more people would tune into a women’s basketball draft than the MLB or NHL’s draft — but women’s basketball has come a long way. And, the next crop of stars — USC’s JuJu Watkins, Notre Dame’s Hannah Hidalgo, UCLA's Lauren Betts — indicates that this growth could be sustained for years to come."

            "content": "NFL Draft analyst Todd McShay made the best case yet for why the Washington Commanders may go defense in the first round. In his Todd Mock 3.0, McShay selected Georgia Bulldog Safety Malaki Starks at 29 for the Washington Commanders. He selected a defensive back over other considerations at running back, offensive line, and edge. That can be a head-scratcher to some, and I’m sure wide receiver is among the positions others would consider at 29 as well. In the latest Trap or Dive podcast, Todd McShay joined the show and explained his thought process for why the Commanders most likely go defense, position-aside, over an offensive player because Washington has successfully identified their quarterback.\n\nMock 3.0! — My Mock 4.0 will release next Wednesday, one day before the NFL Draft.

One of the organizations in the playoffs almost every year. They’re always picking in the mid to late 20s or 30s. They are one of the most patient organizations out there, and their patience gets paid off just about every year in the draft and it’s maybe it’s sticking there at 22 or 24 or it’s trading back just a few spots to a team that’s getting anxious right and they always wind up with a player you’re like I never thought he was going to be there and I think now the Commanders, there’s like, now you’re in this now you’re at the big boy table.”\n\nTo be at the big boy table, you have to have a quarterback in place, which gives you the freedom to find difference-makers defensively because a Jayden Daniels-led offense will undoubtedly score points.\n\n“If you go back and study all these really good organizations that are always in the playoffs, Chiefs, the Bills now, the Eagles, especially the Packers, the Ravens, every one of them, if you go study their draft history, go year by year, once they identified like, yeah, that’s our guy at quarterback. It’s like they took this sharp left turn, and every draft after that, and I’m talking three-four years like they’re still doing it. You know why? in talking to these GMs. Two reasons. One, because my guy is going to make up for the sins of 10 guys on that side of the ball. But he can’t help those guys on that side of the ball. So, we better get great with personnel on that side of the ball.”\n\nMore importantly than difference-makers, the Commanders need closers, and the GMs that McShay has gotten a chance to have conversations with and study understand the importance of finishing games on the defensive side of the football.\n\n“I remember talking to Bill Polian, the old GM for the Colts when he came and worked at ESPN. One of his big things was that we had to get pass rushers on that turf. I can remember how passionate he was. We had to have closers, guys who could close the game. Talking to Howie Roseman at the combine. He said the same way, “We had we had to find closers.” The Commanders are in a position now that they have their guy, and they can be patient and sit back. If it’s an edge rusher, awesome. But if it’s not, then we take a player that everyone in the league thinks is one of the 20, 24, 25 best players in the league in Starks, and let’s take him and get a difference maker.”\n\nYou can listen to the full Trap or Dive episode with Todd McShay below.

Here's what to watch for\n\ntoggle caption Bruce Bennett/Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON — Hockey's Stanley Cup Playoffs begin Saturday.\n\nIt's a tall order to live up to last year's dramatic seven-game final. But the pieces are in place for an entertaining playoffs, with contenders for first-time Stanley Cup winners and generational stars looking for a last trophy to cap off their career.\n\nThe puck drops on the first round with a pair of games on Saturday and three more to follow Sunday. And with no New York, no Boston and no Chicago in the mix, it's a chance for smaller(-ish) markets to shine — including the NHL's smallest market, Winnipeg, whose Jets finished with the best record in the league and head into the playoffs with a top seed.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHere's who to watch for:\n\n\n\nThe Washington Capitals\n\nPre-season expectations were low, low, low for the Washington Capitals last fall.\n\nIn October, the Athletic gave the Caps only an 18% chance of making the playoffs — and less than a 1% likelihood of earning more than 110 points. Franchise cornerstone Alex Ovechkin turned 39 and had just posted the second-lowest goal-scoring season of his career. The only two other remaining pieces of the roster that won the Stanley Cup in 2018 — winger Tom Wilson and defenseman John Carlson — also looked to be past their primes.\n\nInstead, Washington has blown those expectations out of the water.\n\nThe Capitals have the best record in the Eastern Conference. Ovechkin has the fourth-most goals in the league, and his chase for Gretzky's all-time career goals record energized the whole team. Younger players like Dylan Strome, Connor McMichael and Aliaksei Protas have all played the best seasons of their careers.\n\ntoggle caption Justin Berl/Getty Images\n\nYet now that the Ovi-Gretzky chase is over and the playoffs are nigh, there is cause for concern. The Caps have slumped. Injuries and perhaps a post-chase energy comedown have contributed to losses in eight of their last 12 games.\n\n\"It's like, has this chase drawn too much out of them, or has this raised their game to another level and they're just kind of patiently waiting now to start playing playoffs and ramp it back up again?\" said ESPN analyst P. K. Subban, who played 13 seasons in the NHL.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNo team ever wants to enter the playoffs on a cold streak, yet that's exactly where the Capitals are. Now they'll look to shake it off in a first-round matchup against the Montreal Canadiens.\n\n\n\nThe Tkachuks\n\nWhether you see Tkachuks as the heroes or the villains might depend on your national allegiance … or your political persuasion. But it's undeniable that last February's 4 Nations Face-Off, the NHL's wildly successful replacement for an All-Star Game, propelled the two brothers from hockey stars into actual stars.\n\nBoth Tkachuks — Matthew, of the Florida Panthers, and Brady, of the Ottawa Senators — were already big names in the hockey world. And as Americans with six NHL All-Star Game appearances between them, they were locks for Team USA.\n\nThe 4 Nations Face-Off began just a couple weeks after President Trump's inauguration. When Team USA traveled to Montreal to play Canada, the Canadian fans showered the arena with boos as the Star-Spangled Banner was sung. And Matthew Tkachuk \"didn't like\" that, as he said later, and the moment the puck hit the ice, he dropped his gloves to fight a Canadian player. Brady did the same moments later. It was an electric moment for hockey. (The U.S. won that game, which was the most-viewed non-Olympic hockey game ever in the U.S. But Canada got the last laugh when it won the final in overtime.)\n\nAhead of the final, Matthew Tkachuk told ESPN that he viewed 4 Nations as more important than the previous year's Stanley Cup Final between his Panthers and the Edmonton Oilers, which went to seven games. \"Even comparing it to last year's game, this feels bigger. It feels bigger than Game 7,\" he said.\n\nFor both Tkachuk brothers, the spring has been a bit of a comedown since then. Matthew sustained a lower-body injury during the 4 Nations event that has sidelined him for the past 25 games. And Brady has dealt with an injury of his own that has caused him to miss eight games.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut both are set to return in the playoffs. Matthew's Panthers open with a first-round matchup against fellow Floridians, the Tampa Bay Lightning. And Brady's Senators will take on the Toronto Maple Leafs in a \"battle for Ontario.\"\n\nNo matter the results, get ready to see them back with Team USA next February in the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\ntoggle caption Cameron Bartlett/Getty Images\n\nWinnipeg's first Stanley Cup?\n\nWinnipeg is a long-suffering hockey town.\n\nThe first iteration of its NHL team, the Jets, played in town from 1979 to 1996 — and never won a Stanley Cup, or even advanced past the second round of the playoffs. Then, the team packed up and moved to Arizona, and Winnipeg went without an NHL team until 2011. When the new version of the Jets arrived in town, local fans were so hungry for an NHL team that tickets to the home opener went for $1,000 or more.\n\nYet this new version of the Jets hasn't won a Stanley Cup, either. And it's not because the team has been bad: They've reached the playoffs in seven of the past eight seasons.\n\nThis year, the Jets finished 56-22-4, the best record in hockey. And the pressure is on to deliver. A mere appearance in the Stanley Cup Final would be the best result in franchise history, new or old.\n\nOne player to know: The Jets' hopes rest, in large part, on the shoulders of goaltender Connor Hellebuyck, who leads the NHL in both wins and save percentage. No team allowed fewer goals all season than the Jets. (Hellebuyck was another star for Team USA in the 4 Nations Faceoff.)\n\n\"The kind of year that he's stitched together for himself this year is really, really, really impressive,\" said Mark Messier, the six-time Stanley Cup champion who is now an analyst for ESPN. \"And it hasn't been all Hellebuyck. They've played excellent structurally. They've got great scoring, timely scoring, depth at position.\""

            "description": "Strategy by round and position, as well as top-available options for 2025...",
            "content": "An integral part of the Steelers’ draft strategy is determining where prospects will likely be drafted, rather than just scouting them in a vacuum. Last year is a good example of this. They could have drafted a center like Graham Barton in the first round but waited until the second and found terrific value with Zach Frazier, who looks the part of a future Pro Bowler.\n\nThis mock draft (ish) is a projection of how the Steelers can maximize value round by round. This is not a hedge of my bets. My final mock will drop next week. I think these positions are the most likely targets and the best value. I think ultimately, you’ll see a number of these guys in black and gold.\n\nRound 1, Pick 21:\n\nI’ve been on the Steelers drafting a defensive lineman for roughly four months now, but with each passing day, I’m losing confidence that will be the case. That is a strange feeling, given it’s truly the only position on the roster in dire need of a starter. The cupboard is bare after Cam Heyward and Keeanu Benton. But I’m sticking with this tier being addressed with their first selection.\n\nHarmon is the only one of these gentlemen who visited the Steelers for a top 30 visit. He’s an athletic three-tech who burst onto the scene for the Oregon Ducks this past season.\n\nThey did meet with Grant at the combine but haven’t shown much interest in Nolen.\n\nPlayers like Grant or Harmon would allow the Steelers to play consistently in their base alignment, demand double teams - and finally free up the linebackers so they can have more flexibility.\n\nKenneth Grant is a MENACE at the center of a defense.\n\n\n\nHe constantly draws double teams but has still managed 8 sacks, 50 pressures, and 39 run stops in the last two seasons.\n\n\n\nHe’s all of 6’3, 342lbs and is an INCREDIBLE athlete at that size. Could end up a top 10 pick. pic.twitter.com/ugjrmahM6Z — NFL Draft Files (@NFL_DF) January 31, 2025\n\nRound 3, Pick 83:\n\nThis should get Yinz talking, but I simply can’t ignore the Steelers’ interest in quarterbacks. Either they are going to draft one or are giving off a Snoop Dogg-esque smoke screen.\n\nI think we’re all in agreement. The best value would actually be bypassing this class of quarterbacks for next year’s class, but they aren’t thinking that way.\n\nShough has been a speculative fast riser, but I won’t be surprised if he has a seismic fall. He’s going to be 26 years old and didn’t put together a strong season until this past year at Louisville.\n\nHoward has the size and mobility the team is likely searching for. They had dinner with him at his pro day.\n\nMcCord had a really poor debut campaign at Ohio State - but had an impressive bounce-back season at Syracuse, leading the ACC in passing yards.\n\nIf Pittsburgh doesn’t address the position in the third round - I don’t think they will at all.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I wouldn’t be a big fan of this selection. But it’s the way I’m leaning.\n\nRound 4, Pick 123:\n\nThe second tier of running backs is so much better than the second tier of defensive tackles. It feels like the Steelers have done a good job evaluating the opportunity cost here. Why am I so confident in that? Well, all four of these explosive backs jumped on a plane to visit Pittsburgh for a pre-draft workout.\n\nExplosive is the operative word.\n\nTuten and Blue registered the two fastest 40-yard dash times at the NFL combine. Giddens and Harvey are more well-rounded and have a higher likelihood of being three-down backs.\n\nIn any other draft, these guys are probably drafted in rounds two or three.\n\nChecking out UCF RB R.J. Harvey who was one of the #Steelers pre draft visits\n\n\n\nHas an elite jump cut with + speed & vision. Finishes runs well, but needs to protect himself better.\n\n\n\nThis is one of my favorite clips I’ve seen of any RB in this class\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/vOHWQsBqza — Steelers Blitz (@Steelers_Blitz) April 12, 2025\n\nRound 5, Pick 156:\n\nSavion Williams, WR, TCU\n\nTai Felton, WR, Maryland\n\nJaCorey Brooks, WR, Louisville\n\nWilliams is a unique prospect who will likely be drafted earlier. He looks like he was built in a lab. His tape is incredible, but his production wasn’t all that inspiring. He compiled 60 catches for 611 yards last season, but both were easily his best in his five years.\n\nFelton is an intriguing prospect who has elite speed and can immediately contribute in the slot, with the potential to eventually be a Z receiver.\n\nSomeone who should be on the board here is Brooks. I’m calling him as a sleeper pick here. He didn’t meet with the Steelers, but they must be plenty familiar with him given the research they did on his QB Tyler Shough. He was Shough’s go-to guy, posting over 1,000 yards and 9 TDs last season.\n\nFormer five-star recruit and Alabama transfer Ja'Corey Brooks is living up to the billing at Louisville.\n\n\n\nBig-time catch and run. Has 3 catches for 121 yards and 2 touchdowns against SMU. https://t.co/otixhRDN7Y pic.twitter.com/ZTYqmTaIma — Pete Nakos (@PeteNakos_) October 5, 2024\n\nRound 6, Pick 185:\n\nWillie Lampkin, G, North Carolina\n\nCharles Grant, T/G, William and Mary\n\nTyler Cooper, G, Minnesota\n\nThe Steelers are going to draft a guard at some point during this draft; while the starters are penciled in, they lost James Daniels to the Miami Dolphins in free agency. Assistant GM Andy Wiedl will continue to address the trenches, as there isn’t a ton of depth up front for the black and gold.\n\nRound 7, Pick 229:\n\nSmael Mondon Jr., LB, Georgia\n\nCarson Bruener, LB, Washington\n\nJay Higgins, LB, Iowa State\n\nPittsburgh lost Elandon Roberts this offseason, and Cole Holcomb’s health is still in question.\n\nMondon is the prize of this group, but the interesting name to watch is Bruener. That name may ring a bell. He’s the son of former Steelers TE Mark Bruener — and we know how much the Steelers love their bloodlines!\n\nNote: No cornerback. I think they are comfortable with that room, considering Cory Trice Jr. and Beanie Bishop are entrenched behind Joey Porter Jr. and the newly acquired Darius Slay. Don’t forget second-year DB Ryan Watts could also be returning to the fray.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this draft strategy? Let us know in the comments section!"

            "content": "© Matthew Smith & Alicia Malnati/Gymnastics Now\n\nThe first national champions were crowned on Thursday as the 2025 NCAA Women’s Gymnastics Championships kicked off with semifinal competition.\n\nNo. 2 Oklahoma (197.550), No. 4 Utah (197.7625), No. 5 UCLA (197.7375), and No. 7 Missouri (197.300) will contend for the NCAA team title on Saturday, April 19 at 4 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nNo. 3 Florida (197.200) was the shock elimination from the first semifinal, as the Tigers edged the Gators by a tenth. No. 11 Alabama (196.825) was also eliminated from that semifinal.\n\nThen came the arguably bigger shock: No. 1 seed and defending champion LSU (197.525) was edged by No. 4 Utah and No. 5 UCLA. The Tigers and No. 8 Michigan State (197.3625) were sent packing.\n\nIndividual national champions were crowned at the conclusion of the two semifinals, and there were no ties this year.\n\nOklahoma’s Jordan Bowers took home the all-around crown with a 39.7125. Bowers wasn’t the standout for the Sooners through the regular season – that was 2024 NCAA beam champion Faith Torrez – but she has turned on the heaters in the postseason, scoring three perfect 10s in the Washington regional final.\n\nOn vault, LSU freshman phenom Kailin Chio was nearly perfect with her Yurchenko 1.5, scoring a 9.975 to take home the first NCAA title of her career. UCLA’s Jordan Chiles picked up right where she left off in 2023 (before going on an Olympic hiatus in 2024), winning the bars title once more. Missouri’s Helen Hu was clutch in the anchor spot for the Tigers, securing their spot in the Four on the Floor and winning the beam title with a 9.9875. (A year ago, she was retired and backpacking the world – talk about a 180!) Brooklyn Moors’ penultimate floor routine for the Bruins was golden, scoring a 9.9625.\n\nClick here to jump to the beginning of our live updates from the semifinals.\n\nThu. April 17 @ 11:15 p.m. It will be Oklahoma, Utah, UCLA, and Missouri in the Four on the Floor national final Saturday. The meet begins at 4 p.m. ET on ABC. Click here for all the links you need to watch. Here are the individual national champions: AA: Jordan Bowers (Oklahoma) – 39.7125\n\nVT: Kailin Chio (LSU) – 9.975\n\nUB: Jordan Chiles (UCLA) – 9.975\n\nBB: Helen Hu (Missouri) – 9.9875\n\nFX: Brooklyn Moors (UCLA) – 9.9625\n\nThu. April 17 @ 11:06 p.m. Semifinal II: Utah, UCLA advance in semifinal for the ages All four teams in the second semifinal were separated by less than two-tenths between every rotation. In the end, it’s Utah and UCLA advancing as defending champion LSU and Michigan State are eliminated. Utah was exceptional on bars, with all counting scores going 9.9+, highlighted by Grace McCallum’s 9.9625 in the anchor spot. UCLA had similar success on beam, with its final three routine scoring 9.9+. Emma Malabuyo closed things out with a 9.975. LSU went to vault in the final rotation and wasn’t able to find enough sticks to surpass UCLA. Freshman Kailin Chio was the highlight with a 9.975, winning the vault title. The only other athlete to go 9.9 was Haleigh Bryant. Michigan State held its own all night long, but little mistakes on floor were the difference between an appearance in the final and going home. Skyla Schulte closed the Spartans’ season with a 9.9375. Individually, Oregon State’s Jade Carey closed things out on vault with a 9.85, Arkansas’ Joscelyn Roberson on bars with a 9.8, Cal’s Mya Lauzon on beam with a 9.95, and Kentucky’s Creslyn Brose on floor with a 9.9.\n\nThu. April 17 @ 10:33 p.m. After rotation 3: UCLA – 148.1875 LSU – 148.150 Utah – 148.1125 Michigan State – 148.000 STILL less than two-tenths between all four, but UCLA and LSU have jumped into the top two spots. LSU heads to vault, where scoring has been the tightest. Utah will be on bars, UCLA on beam, and Michigan State on floor. Who will advance!? Highlights from rotation 3: Grace McCallum went 9.95 on vault for the Red Rocks. UCLA saw a 9.975 from Jordan Chiles to anchor bars. Michigan State couldn’t break into the 9.9s on beam, but the Spartans were led by Cady Duplissis. LSU got things back on track on floor, with three scores of 9.9+, including a 9.9375 from Aleah Finnegan. Individual scores: VT: Joscelyn Roberson (Arkansas) – 9.825\n\nUB: Maddie Williams (California) – 9.525\n\nBB: Isabella Magnelli (Kentucky) – 9.9125\n\nFX: Jade Carey (Oregon State) – 9.9125\n\nThu. April 17 @ 10:18 p.m. UCLA’s Mika Webster-Longin (knee) has been taken to the locker room for X-rays and is not expected to return.\n\nThu. April 17 @ 10:11 p.m. At the halfway point: Michigan State – 98.8375 Utah – 98.775 UCLA – 98.7625 LSU – 98.650 All four teams are separated by less than TWO-TENTHS heading to rotation 3. Literally anyone could advance at this point. UCLA had a solid vault rotation, finding their landings and being highlighted by a 9.9 from Chae Campbell. They also avoided counting a 9.4375 from Mika Webster-Longin, who seemed to be injured on her vault. Michigan State jumped into the lead after an outstanding bar rotation that saw three scores of 9.9+, including a 9.9375 from Gabrielle Stephen. LSU was good, but not great on beam, only scoring a 9.9 from Konnor McClain. Aleah Finnegan fell in the anchor spot, meaning the team had to count a 9.8 and missed out on potentially crucial tenths. Utah had an excellent showing on floor, scoring over 9.9 on four routines, including a 9.95 from Grace McCallum. Individual scores: VT: Sophia Diaz (Michigan) – 9.7125\n\nUB: Maddie Jones (Arkansas) – 9.775\n\nBB: Jade Carey (Oregon State) – 9.95 – no beam title for Jade, but she’s still in the mix for the all-around\n\nFX: Joscelyn Roberson (Arkansas) – 9.9\n\nThu. April 17 @ 9:59 p.m. Mika Webster-Longin seemed to lock out her legs landing vault and looked like she was injured walking off. A short while later, Aleah Finnegan falls on beam on her front aerial and looks shocked. Thankfully for the Tigers, that was their anchor routine. Yes, they’ll have to count a 9.800 – which isn’t ideal with the other three teams in this meet – but it could be worse.\n\nThu. April 17 @ 9:32 p.m. After rotation 1: UCLA – 49.525 Michigan State – 49.3875 LSU – 49.325 Utah – 49.2125 A very interesting rotation to start this exciting meet! Michigan State was lights out on vault, putting up a 49.3875, including a 9.9125 from Amy Doyle and 9.95 from Sage Kellerman – the two highest vault scores so far during the semifinals. It was a similar story for UCLA on floor, with Brooklyn Moors leading the team with a 9.9625, which leads the competition right now. LSU was strong on bars, but the Tigers only put up a 9.9 from Lexi Zeiss, who led the defending national champions off. Utah struggled on beam with a fall from Camie Winger making the Red Rocks have to count a 9.75 from Amelie Morgan. Avery Neff led the team with a 9.9125. Individual scores: VT: Kaya Forbes (UNC) – 9.7875\n\nUB: Jade Carey (Oregon State) – 9.9125\n\nBB: Joscelyn Roberson (Arkansas) – 9.900\n\nFX: Mya Lauzon (California) – 9.9125\n\nThu. April 17 @ 9:08 p.m. Semifinal 2 is underway!\n\nThu. April 17 @ 7:43 p.m. The Helen Hu story just keeps getting better. Read more about her return after a year of retirement and backpacking: https://gymnastics-now.com/helen-hus-true-perfect-10-and-the-long-journey-to-achieve-it/\n\nThu. April 17 @ 7:16 p.m. If you thought that semifinal was competitive, just wait for No. 1 LSU vs. No. 4 Utah vs. No. 5 UCLA vs. No. 8 Michigan State! We’ll be back at 9 p.m. ET to see how it all unfolds!\n\nThu. April 17 @ 7:06 p.m. Semifinal I: Oklahoma gets its redemption as Missouri upsets Florida to advance to Four on the Floor Less than a tenth stood between Missouri and Florida heading into the final rotation of the first semifinal at the 2025 NCAA Women’s Gymnastics Championships, and a tenth ended up being the difference between the Tigers making their first NCAA final appearance ever and the Gators being sent packing. It came down to the final routines for both teams: Riley McCusker up on bars for the Gators – just weeks after earning her first-ever perfect 10 at the SEC championships on this event – and Helen Hu – who was backpacking around the world and retired a year ago – on beam. Ultimately, the beam specialist who earned her first (and second and third) perfect 10 on the event this season delivered once more, scoring a 9.9875. Missouri 197.300 – Florida 197.200. Also advancing to Saturday’s Four on the Floor are the Oklahoma Sooners. A year ago, the Sooners were the biggest story of championships, but not in a good way. After a dominating season, months of hard work was wiped away in a rotation, when the Sooners saw mistake after mistake on vault. This year, they haven’t been as dominate, but ending on vault wasn’t an issue. They scored a 197.550 to win the session and advance. Alabama was fourth with a 196.825. With individual titles on the line today, here is who leads with one more semifinal to go: AA: Jordan Bowers (Oklahoma) – 39.7125\n\nVT: Danie Ferris (Florida) – 9.900\n\nUB: TIE Jordan Bowers (Oklahoma), Mara Titarsolej (Missouri), Leanne Wong (Florida), Alyssa Arana (Florida) – 9.9375\n\nBB: Helen Hu (Missouri) – 9.9875\n\nFX: TIE Jordan Bowers (Oklahoma), Faith Torrez (Oklahoma) – 9.950\n\nThu. April 17 @ 6:46 p.m. The Oklahoma Sooners redeem themselves a year after catastrophe, and it’s MISSOURI taking down FLORIDA by a tenth to advance to the Tigers’ FIRST-EVER NCAA finals appearance! Beam queen Helen Hu delivered a 9.9875 in the final spot to book the Tigers’ ticket to the Four on the Floor! WOW!\n\nThu. April 17 @ 6:10 p.m. After rotation 3: 148.275 147.800 147.725 147.4875 A season-low 49.075 drops Florida to third heading into the final rotation. ESPN says that’s the Gators’ lowest vault score in approximately five years – wow. Missouri jumps ahead by 0.075 after a 49.450 on bars, led by Mara Titarsolej’s 9.9375, which is currently tied with Jordan Bowers for the top score on the event so far today. Meanwhile, Bowers and Faith Torrez posted matching 9.95s to lead OU on floor and lead the floor standings so far. Sooners go 49.525 and have a good lead heading to vault. Just remember: vault is where the Sooners lost the semifinals a year ago, ultimately not advancing to the final in a shocking turn. And vault has been the tightest, scoring-wise. Individual scores: VT: Mary McDonough (Washington) – 9.8125\n\nUB: Rylie Mundell (Denver) – 9.875\n\nBB: Gabby McLaughlin (Auburn) – 9.175\n\nFX: Madison Ulrich (Denver) – 9.85\n\nThu. April 17 @ 5:40 p.m. At the halfway point: Oklahoma – 98.750 Florida – 98.650 Missouri – 98.350 Alabama – 98.2875 Oklahoma and Missouri escape rotation 2 without having to count falls. Tiger Elise Tisler had a stunning and stuck Yurchenko full that scored a 9.875 (max is a 9.95 for that vault). Alabama’s Ryan Fuller led the Tide on bars with a 9.925. Faith Torrez closed things out for the Sooners on beam with a 9.95, which ties for the highest score of the day on that event so far. Florida couldn’t break into the 9.9s on floor and, surprisingly, Leanne Wong had some minor errors in her routine, resulting in her 9.6625 being dropped. Gabby Disidore and Selena Harris-Miranda led the team with matching 9.8875s. Individual scores: VT: Rosie Casali (Denver) = 9.7125\n\nUB: Olivia Greaves (Auburn) = 9.7875\n\nBB: Madison Ulrich (Denver) = 9.8875\n\nFX: Mary McDonough (Washington) = 9.025 (fall)\n\nThu. April 17 @ 5:21 p.m. Oklahoma’s Lily Pederson falls on beam. And Missouri’s Hannah Horton falls on her Yurchenko 1.5 on vault.\n\nThu. April 17 @ 5:07 p.m. After rotation 1: Oklahoma – 49.400 Florida – 49.300 Missouri – 49.225 Alabama – 49.125 Oklahoma was led by a 9.9375 from Jordan Bowers. Florida saw an outstanding routine from Selena Harris-Miranda on beam that scored a 9.95. Missouri was consistent, but all counting scores were in the 9.8s – unable to get into 9.9 territory. Alabama had to count a 9.7875. Individual scores: VT: Ady Wahl (Georgia) = 9.875 for an excellent Yurchenko 1.5, just a small step forward.\n\nUB: Madison Ulrich (Denver) = 9.8875\n\nBB: Mary McDonough (Washington) = 9.600\n\nFX: Mya Hooten (Minnesota) = 9.8875 – just a stunning routine to cap Mya’s gymnastics career. Superbly controlled tumbling passes, great energy, and all the feels for the Golden Gopher! One judge gave her a 10, to which we say right on!\n\nThu. April 17 @ 4:49 p.m. See every score as it comes through on Virtius! Link: https://virti.us/session?s=xhZmjBrMse Alabama and Missouri starting undesirable scores in the 9.7s – those can’t be the norm if they want to advance, especially against powerhouses like Oklahoma and Florida.

            "content": "FORT WORTH – The No. 1 LSU Gymnastics team had their 2025 season come to a close in the evening session of the 2025 NCAA Championship Semifinals after finishing third with a 197.5250 team score on Thursday night in Dickies Arena.\n\nNo. 1 LSU finished behind Utah (197.7625) and UCLA (197.7375) in Thursday’s meet, who advanced to Saturday’s final round with their top two finishes. The Tigers defeated Michigan State (197.3625) on the night.\n\nFreshman phenom Kailin Chio wrapped up a sensational freshman campaign by claiming the 2025 NCAA Vault Champion title with her score of 9.9750, the 19th individual national championship won by a Tiger and eighth on vault.\n\nThe Tigers opened the night on the beam, with leadoff freshman Lexi Zeiss grabbing a 9.9000 to start things off. Junior Ashley Cowan scored a 9.8125 in the second spot, followed by a 9.8250 from freshman Kailin Chio in spot three. Senior Aleah Finnegan scored a 9.8500 in the fourth spot ahead of a 9.8750 from sophomore Konnor McClain. The anchor spot saw senior Haleigh Bryant score a 9.8750 of her own to give the Tigers a 49.3250 team score in the rotation.\n\nLSU was in third place after the opening rotation with a 49.3250, trailing UCLA (49.5250) and Michigan State (49.3875).\n\nRotation two saw LSU compete on the beam. Graduate student Sierra Ballard scored a 9.8750 to open the rotation ahead of a 9.8000 from sophomore Kylie Coen in the second spot. Spot three saw Chio score a 9.8750 before sophomore Konnor McClain grabbed a 9.90 in spot four. Bryant scored a 9.8750 in the fifth spot before Finnegan concluded the rotation with a 9.2250 due to a fall from the beam. The rotation score came out to a 49.3250.\n\nAt the halfway point, LSU’s 98.6500 ranked fourth in the meet behind Michigan State (98.8375), Utah (98.7750) and UCLA (98.7625).\n\nThe third rotation took the Tigers to the floor, with sophomore Konnor McClain leading things off with a 9.8625. Ballard scored a 9.8250 in the second spot before Chio scored a 9.8875 in spot three. In the fourth spot, sophomore Amari Drayton scored a 9.9000 ahead of a 9.9375 from Finnegan in spot five. The anchor spot saw Bryant keep her strong night rolling with a 9.9125 to help boost the Tigers to a 49.5000 score for the rotation.\n\nHeading into the final rotation of the night, the margins were narrow, with LSU’s 148.1500 ranking them second behind UCLA (148.1875) and ahead of Utah (148.1125) and Michigan State (148.0000).\n\nLSU concluded the night on the vault, with senior KJ Johnson opening the rotation with a 9.8375. Zeiss scored a 9.8000 in spot two before Finnegan posted a 9.8500 score in the third spot and then a 9.8125 from Drayton after her. The fifth spot saw Chio execute a near perfect yurchenko one and a half that scored a 9.9750 and was followed up by a 9.9000 from Bryant in the anchor position to bring LSU’s final rotation score of the night to a 49.3750, which was not enough to bring the Tigers to a top two finish to advance to the final round on Saturday.\n\nIndividually, Chio’s 9.9750 stood alone at the top of the vault competition and meant that she took home the 2025 NCAA vault title. The win marked the first vault title won by a Tiger since 2021, when freshman Haleigh Bryant took home the crown. Chio joined elite company as she became the third freshman in program history to win an individual national championship along with Bryant and Kennedi Edney (2017).\n\nThe Tigers score finished fourth across both semifinal sessions on Thursday. Finnegan and Bryant finished amongst the top 10 performers on the day. Bryant finished fifth on vault and tenth on floor while Finnegan finished fifth on floor.\n\nChio finished tied with Bryant in sixth in the all-around in her first nationals appearance as a freshman.\n\nLSU’s third place finish brings an end to what has been a historical season for the Tigers that was highlighted by a regular season championship, its sixth SEC Championship in program history, the program’s first No. 1 seed ever and the programs 15th regional championship.\n\nLSU’s third place finish brings an end to what has been a historical season for the Tigers that was highlighted by a regular season championship, its sixth SEC Championship title, their first No. 1 seed ever and the program’s 15th regional championship.\n\n2025 NCAA Championship Semifinal Scores (Both Sessions)\n\nSemifinal I\n\nOklahoma 197.5500\n\nMissouri 197.3000\n\nFlorida 197.2000\n\nAlabama 196.8250\n\nSemifinal II\n\nUtah 197.7625\n\nUCLA 197.7375\n\nLSU 197.5250\n\nMichigan State 197.3625"

A hop on the landing in the vault prevented her from capturing what would have been the school’s first all-around national championship.\n\nOklahoma’s Jordan Bowers (39.7125) won the NCAA individual all-around title.\n\nCarey added to her college medal total, however, as she tied for third in balance beam. She finishes with four NCAA silver medals and two bronze during her four years at Oregon State.\n\nCarey’s career includes two gold medals at the Olympics and three at the World Championships.\n\nWhile the Beavers team didn’t make the national semifinals, Carey qualified as an individual and rotated with No. 1 LSU. She would wait for six Tigers to perform in each event before stepping up to execute her routine.\n\nStarting out on bars, Carey earned a 9.9125 and stuck her landing with calm confidence. Soon after on beam, she was consistently smooth and laid her feet down softly on each flip, earning a 9.9500. That put Carey into a tie for first through two rotations.\n\nCarey was alone in first after three rotations, earning a 9.9125 on her floor routine. She was trailed closely by Olympic teammate Jordan Chiles, whose total score was just 0.01 points behind.

            "content": "The New York Yankees and the Tampa Bay Rays meet Friday in MLB action from George M. Steinbrenner Field. This will be the second installment in a four-game weekend series. Here’s a Yankees vs Rays prediction. We will look at this from a betting perspective and determine the best Yankees vs Rays pick. We will examine:\n\nThe New York Yankees recent form and player performance\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays recent form and player performance\n\nRecent betting trends and streaks involving the New York Yankees\n\nRecent betting trends and streaks involving the Tampa Bay Rays\n\nRecent betting trends in games played between the Yankees and Rays\n\nA summary that ties it all together and produces a favorable betting outcome for the Yankees vs Rays game\n\nNew York Yankees Betting Preview\n\nThe Yankees posted a hot start this year, sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers in three games. New York would lose their next series versus the Arizona Diamondbacks before bouncing back with a series victory versus the Pittsburgh Pirates. New York dropped another series versus the Detroit Tigers, then did the same versus the San Francisco Giants. After wins in their first pair versus he Royals this week, on Wednesday the Yankees posted eight hits in a 4-3 win. Aaron Judge managed a solo home run with two runs and three hits on the day. Clarke Schmidt added 5.2 innings with three earned on four hits and two walks.\n\nIn their opener versus the Rays on Thursday, New York scored three runs in the sixth inning along the way to a 6-3 victory. Ben Rice put up four hits with two RBI, and Oswaldo Cabrera added two hits with two runs and a solo homer.\n\nIn the starter slot for Friday the Yankees will go with Carlos Rodon. This year Rodon is 1-3 with a 5.48 ERA in four starts and 23.0 total innings. Rodon has a 76-66 record with a 3.88 ERA in 202 career games (197 starts).\n\nTampa Bay Rays Betting Preview\n\nOver on the Rays’ side, they opened up the season with wins in two of three versus the Colorado Rockies. Tampa Bay then won two of three versus the Pittsburgh Pirates before losing in a three-game sweep versus the Texas Rangers. The Rays followed that up with a series loss versus the Angels and a series win over the Atlanta Braves. Tampa Bay split their first two games this week versus the rival Boston Red Sox. In the rubber match Wednesday the Rays had five hits (and gave up five as well) in a tough loss 1-0. Zack Little managed 6.0 innings with one earned on five hits and three walks in the tough-luck defeat.\n\nIn Thursday’s matchup Tampa Bay had a 3-1 lead for a couple of innings but couldn’t score after the third. Junior Caminero had two RBI with a homer and two hits. Taj Bradley posted 5.1 innings with six earned in the start.\n\nAs starting pitcher for Friday, the Rays are going with Drew Rasmussen. So far over his three starts Rasmussen is 1-0 with a 0.60 ERA in 15.0 innings. Rasmussen is 21-12 with a 2.85 ERA in 102 career games (53 starts) at the MLB level. He’s also got two saves in that time.\n\nWhy the Tampa Bay Rays will win\n\nThe Yankees have lost seven of their last eight road games against the Rays following a win.\n\nThe Rays have won six of their last eight games against the Yankees following a home loss.\n\nThe Yankees have failed to cover the run line in seven of their last eight road games against the Rays following a road win.\n\nThe Rays have covered the run line in six of their last eight home games against the Yankees following a loss.\n\nWhy the New York Yankees will win\n\nThe Yankees have won each of their last six games against American League opponents that held a losing record.\n\nThe Rays have lost six of their last seven games against American League opponents that held a winning record.\n\nThe Rays have failed to cover the run line in seven of their last eight night games against teams that held a winning record.\n\nThe Yankees have covered the run line each of their last four road games against American League opponents that held a losing record.\n\nTotal Runs Facts\n\nFour of the Yankees' last five night games against American League opponents have gone UNDER the total runs line.\n\nThe 'Inning 1 OVER 0.5 runs' market has hit in eight of the Rays' last nine home games.\n\nThe 'Inning 1 OVER 0.5 runs' market has hit in 16 of the Yankees' last 19 road games against AL East opponents.\n\nYankees vs Rays Prediction\n\nI’ll lean toward the Rays. Tampa Bay should get a nice showing from Rasmussen. Over his three starts this year he’s got 15.0 total innings, one earned, nine hits, two walks and 15 strikeouts. Rasmussen is coming off 5.0 clean frames with four hits and a walk in a no-decision versus the Braves. As for Rodon, he’s 0-3 in his last three starts, giving up a combined 13 earned runs off 10 hits and 10 walks in that time. Rodon will need a much better outing here if he’s going to put New York into position.\n\nTampa Bay had a couple of bad innings in Thursday’s loss but played pretty well outside of that. I think they can rebound Friday."

            "content": "Scottie Scheffler called it a fairly stress-free day. The world No. 1 was in position most of his opening round Thursday morning at the RBC Heritage, missing just three fairways and three greens, not carding a bogey and tallying seven birdies to shoot 7-under 64, a round that was equaled by Russell Henley.\n\nAnd yet, both Scheffler and Henley still trail by three shots through 18 holes at Harbour Town Golf Links.\n\nThe round of the day belonged to Justin Thomas, who fresh off his T-36 at the Masters tied the Heirtage’s scoring record with a 10-under 61. Only David Frost in 1994 and Troy Merritt in 2015 had posted 61s in tournament play here.\n\n“I’d say everything for the most part [was working well],” Thomas said. “I just played really solid. I feel like I didn’t do anything crazy. I just drove the ball well, which is very, very important out here, and I felt like it was just one of those days I put the ball in a spot that I had a lot of good numbers. I had a lot of kind of full wedges to where –although you have to be a little conservative at times out here, I felt like they were kind of pins and angles and everything that I could be a little aggressive and just kind of got rolling with it.”\n\nThomas’ 61 included a bogey at the par-4 10th hole, where he missed the fairway left and later three-putted from 38 feet. Otherwise, Thomas hit nine fairways and only failed to find two greens in regulation. Five of Thomas’ 11 birdies came from 4 feet and in. He also drained three birdie putts between 33 and 38 feet long.\n\nAnd the round could’ve been better. Thomas said his best shot of the day was an 8-iron flushed from 180 yards out to 5 feet. However, Thomas missed the putt to close with par.\n\nThomas hasn’t won since capturing his second PGA Championship, at Southern Hills in May 2022. However, he entered this week’s signature event ranked eighth in the world thanks in large part to two runner-up showings and two other top-10s this year.\n\n“I just didn’t play well last week,” Thomas said. “Put some really good work in I felt like the couple days leading into the start today, and I felt prepared. It was just about going out and doing it, and it was nice to do so.”\n\nWyndham Clark is alone in fourth place after a 65. Five players, including Gary Woodland and Players Championship runner-up J.J. Spaun, share fifth."

            "content": "MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Manchester United’s season isn’t done yet.\n\nOn a night of high drama at Old Trafford, the troubled Premier League club put its domestic problems to one side by sealing a spectacular comeback to beat Lyon 5-4 and advance to the semifinals of the Europa League.\n\nUnited blew a two-goal lead and then had to come back from 4-2 down against 10 men in extra time to produce one of its most memorable victories in its famous stadium.\n\nHarry Maguire’s dramatic winner in added time of extra time sparked scenes of jubilation and kept alive hopes that United could yet salvage a desperate campaign that has left the 20-time English champions languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League.\n\n“We still have time to make something special of this season, so we have to think like that and be positive,” United head coach Ruben Amorim said.\n\nUnited will play Athletic Bilbao in the semifinals after the Spanish club beat Rangers 2-0.\n\nTottenham also overcame its domestic problems by sealing a place in the last four with a 1-0 win against Eintracht Frankfurt and a 2-1 aggregate victory.\n\nBodo/Glimt became the first Norwegian team to reach the semifinals of a European competition by beating Lazio 3-2 on penalties. Lazio sent the game to a shootout after 3-1 win in extra time meant the tie ended 3-3 on aggregate.\n\nComeback king\n\nUnited has been famed for its comebacks over the years — none more famous than victory against Bayern Munich to win the Champions League final in 1999 when late goals by Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sealed a 2-1 win.\n\nSuch moments feel a long way away for a team that is languishing 14th in England’s top flight and is guaranteed to end the campaign with a club-record-low points total in the Premier League era.\n\nThe Europa League is Amorim’s last chance of success this season, while victory would also secure a place in the lucrative Champions League next campaign.\n\nUnited had led 2-0 at halftime through goals from Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot and could have been further ahead with Bruno Fernandes hitting the bar and Alejandro Garnacho failing to score when through on goal.\n\nBut it let a commanding position slip by conceding twice in six minutes in the second half, with Corentin Tolisso and Nicolas Tagliafico stunning the home crowd.\n\nDespite Tolisso being sent off in the 89th, Lyon led 4-2 in extra time through Rayan Cherki and an Alexandre Lacazette penalty.\n\nAs some fans started to leave the stadium, United mounted a comeback with three goals in seven minutes. Fernandes scored from the penalty spot and then Kobbie Mainoo leveled with a curling shot inside the box.\n\nThe stage was set for Maguire — playing as a makeshift striker — to head the winner.\n\n“It was fun,” said Amorim. “If you see the goals from Kobbie and Harry Maguire, the sound of the stadium was the best sound I ever (heard). You want to keep that. People want to keep a lot of things, shirts, I just want to keep that sound, it’s the best sound in the world.”\n\nOihan Sancet and Nico Williams were on target for United’s semifinals opponent Bilbao. A 2-0 win against Rangers at San Mames settled the tie after the first leg ended 0-0.\n\nTottenham advances\n\nDominic Solanke’s first-half penalty secured victory for Tottenham against Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nSpurs have also endured a miserable domestic campaign and are one place below United in the league. But the deep run in the Europa League has provided rare moments of optimism and it remains in with a chance of winning a first trophy since 2008.\n\n“The players believe in what we’re doing and I’m so proud of them because it was a big game for us — no doubt about it — for our season, for everything, and what we’re trying to achieve,” Tottenham coach Ange Postecoglou said.\n\nSpurs needed the assistance of VAR when it was awarded a penalty for a foul by Frankfurt goalkeeper Kaua Santos on James Maddison.\n\nSolanke fired down the middle for the decisive goal in the 43rd minute.\n\nSpurs will face Norwegian history maker Bodo/Glimt in the semifinals.\n\nBodo/Glimt goalkeeper Nikitka Haikin denied Lazio’s Taty Castellanos from the spot to decide the shootout.\n\n“It’s historic, not only for Bodø/Glimt but for all of Norwegian football,” Haikin said. “Even after I saved Castellanos’ shot, I didn’t realise we’d won — but then I saw the guys running and I started running too.”\n\nConference League\n\nBig teams remain in the third-tier UEFA Conference League after Chelsea, Fiorentina and Real Betis all advanced to the semifinals.\n\nChelsea’s 3-0 first leg win against Legia Warsaw meant it would have taken a remarkable turnaround at Stamford Bridge to prevent the two-time Champions League winner from progressing. And despite a 2-1 loss, Chelsea won 4-2 on aggregate.\n\nFiorentina needed Moise Kean’s second-half goal to draw 2-2 at home against Celje and a 4-3 aggregate win.\n\nBetis advanced 3-1 on aggregate against Jagiellonia Bialystok after a 1-1 draw.\n\nDjurgarden beat SK Rapid 4-1 to seal a 4-2 aggregate win.\n\nDjurgarden plays Chelsea in the semifinals and Fiorentina plays Betis.\n\n___\n\nJames Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"

They have $80.9 million in dead cap, but their $33.5 million in cap space is the fifth-most in the NFL.\n\nThey will need some of that room to sign quarterback Brock Purdy to a contract extension.\n\nMatt Maiocco of NBC Sports Bay Area said on KNBR on Thursday that Purdy’s camp has an offer they aren’t “inclined to take at this point.” Purdy is expected to get a deal worth more than $50 million annually, which would rank 11th in the NFL.\n\n49ers owner Jed York recently called Purdy a top-10 quarterback, and the team will have to pay Purdy like one.\n\nRams wide receiver Puka Nacua said he thinks that will be a mistake, because of the amount of cap space a contract that large would eat up. Nacua made his comments Wednesday on Julian Edelman’s “Games with Names” podcast.\n\n“I don’t think so,” Nacua said about Purdy being worthy of a $50 million-plus contract, via Joaquin Ruiz of NBC Sports Bay Area. “I think [mid-$40 million] range. I think so.\n\n“He seems like a smart guy. They have a chance to still be in their window, and I think if he goes for [$50 million-plus], then the window closes.”\n\nPlayers generally don’t talk about other players’ money, especially players from other teams, even if Nacua’s point is valid. The quarterback market is what it is, and Purdy has earned a top deal with a 23-13 regular-season record, a 4-2 postseason record, 9,518 passing yards and 64 touchdowns while playing for peanuts as Mr. Irrelevant.\n\nPurdy is 1-2 as a starter against the Rams in his career."

They were still in the middle of a bidding war for Will Fries when they signed his Colts teammate Ryan Kelly; the center immediately joined the recruiting effort for the Indianapolis guard, who agreed to a five-year, $87.7 million deal with the team the next day. The two interior linemen should bring the physical presence the Vikings need, but there could still be a push to round out the group with another guard."

Check out our series-by-series previews, breaking down the keys to each matchup, plus predictions.\n\nEASTERN CONFERENCE\n\nMatchup to watch: Bam vs. Mobley\n\nMiami's Bam Adebayo and Cleveland's Evan Mobley are the queen-on-the-chessboard pieces for their respective teams: the interior defenders able to switch out to the perimeter against any ball-handler without conceding anything; the offensive hubs who can operate from the elbows and trigger dribble-handoffs or turn, face up and attack; their coaches’ most enticing answers for how best to maximize their own possessions and blow up opponents’. They’ll often guard each other, as they frequently did during their regular-season matchups. (They’ll also guard everybody else … which is kind of the point.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nMobley doesn’t have to loudly dominate the matchup for Cleveland to win the series. Just quietly continuing to be an elite weak-side help defender, a high-efficiency source of secondary inside-the-arc offense, a complementary facilitator and a good enough on-ball option to hold Adebayo below his season averages should be plenty good enough. But if it tilts the other way ... then Miami’s exceedingly thin chances of pulling the upset figure to improve.— Devine\n\nHeat-Cavaliers series preview, schedule and prediction\n\nMatchup to watch: The forwards\n\nRarely do we see both teams' best two players match up with each other, but we may here.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nIn their lone meeting, Banchero spent the bulk of his time on Tatum and held up fairly well when Tatum was not pick-and-rolling into more advantageous matchups in a 30-point performance. Both are among the NBA's strongest power forwards, at least among the new type that can create, well ... everything. They are Duke-bred to be great. One was a No. 1 overall pick. The other should have been. What theater.\n\nWagner and Brown never faced each other during the regular season, but Wagner defended few more people than he did Brown last season. They are creative wings of their own right. They will get to their spots and organize others into theirs just as easily. It is just that Brown has no shortage of outlets, as, in addition to Tatum, White and Holiday and Porziņģis or Horford are waiting at the arc for an open 3. — Rohrbach\n\nMagic-Celtics series preview, schedule and prediction\n\nMatchup to watch: Cade vs. KAT (and the Knicks’ D as a whole)\n\nCunningham feasted against New York during the regular season, averaging 30.8 points and 8.3 assists in 33.6 minutes per game while shooting 56.3% from the floor, 52% from 3-point land and 80% at the free-throw line. The Pistons torched the Knicks to the tune of 121.4 points per 100 possessions with Cade at the controls — 8.1 points-per-100 higher than New York’s full-season defensive rating.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nThe key: Cunningham comfortably attacking, manipulating and exploiting the Knicks in their preferred pick-and-roll coverage, which sees New York’s bigs — and Towns in particular — drop back to protect the paint. That gives the ball-handler room to maneuver … which, against an operator like Cunningham, who pushed his game to a new level this season by becoming a 35% pull-up 3-point shooter, can be hazardous to your health.\n\nIf he turns the corner and gets a step, the 6-foot-6, 235-pound Cunningham is big enough to bulldoze the slighter Bridges or smaller Hart, Brunson and McBride, or to keep them on his hip and get to a comfortable spot in the midrange. The bigger, stronger Anunoby saw less time on Cunningham than Bridges or McBride during the regular season; it’ll be interesting to see if Thibodeau changes that.\n\nIf Cunningham can win the KAT-and-mouse game (sorry), getting a retreating Towns to take a step toward him in hopes of stopping the ball, he can either thread a pocket pass or loft a lob to the screener rolling behind the defense. Robinson, who has looked pretty damn good since returning from ankle surgery, is a much better defender in the pick-and-roll than Towns or Precious Achiuwa; heavier minutes for him might be worth a look. — Devine\n\nPistons-Knicks series preview, schedule and prediction\n\nMatchup to watch: Giannis Antetokounmpo vs. Pascal Siakam\n\nNobody has spent more time defending Antetokounmpo than Siakam did in parts of 130 possessions over a total of 27 minutes this season, according to the NBA's tracking data. In those minutes Giannis scored 47 points on 67% shooting (22-33 FG). Turner might have been a worse option against the Greek Freak, allowing 38 points on 56% shooting (14-25 FG) in only 39 possessions, per the tracking data.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nQuite simply: The Pacers have nobody who can stop Giannis. This is where we remind you that he missed the entirety of last year's first-round series between the two teams, paving the way for Indiana's victory. — Rohrbach\n\nBucks-Pacers series preview, schedule and prediction\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE\n\nMatchup to watch: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander vs. Ja Morant\n\nSGA and Morant are two of the most electrifying players in the entire league, and it will be fascinating to see Morant try to keep pace with Gilgeous-Alexander's scoring in this series.\n\nNeither will spend much time guarding the other, unless, of course, they hunt each other in the pick-and-roll. Jaylen Wells drew the bulk of the SGA assignment in the regular season, and he is no longer available. That responsibility will now likely fall to Vince Williams Jr., who had a modicum of success against SGA in the regular season. It is quite the ask of a mid-second-round pick, though Memphis asks a lot of its projects.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nConversely, the Thunder have any number of options to throw at Morant. According to the NBA's tracking data, Luguentz Dort, Alex Caruso, Aaron Wiggins and Cason Wallace spent a combined 18:09 on Morant, who in that span finished with 19 points on 7-of-27 shooting (25.9%) and eight assists against four turnovers. Not great. — Rohrbach\n\nGrizzlies-Thunder series preview, schedule and prediction\n\nMatchup to watch: Small vs. big\n\nYes, that’s an oversimplification. Fred VanVleet, perhaps Houston’s most important player for his ability to organize their offense and protect the ball, is (listed at) 6-foot even. Kerr has two bigs to deploy off the bench: the stalwart Looney and rookie Quinten Post. (Jonathan Kuminga’s there, too … if Kerr feels like looking for him.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nFor the most part, though, that’s the stylistic clash at the heart of this series. Golden State wants to downsize and put skill on the floor, spreading you out and slicing you up with ball and body movement. Houston loves nothing more than smothering you with size, giving you nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide. — Devine\n\nWarriors-Rockets series preview, schedule and prediction\n\nMatchup to watch: Anthony Edwards vs. the Lakers' weak link\n\nIt could be Dončić, who was attacked relentlessly in last season's NBA Finals. It could be Reaves. It could be James, who at 40 years old is not the defensive stalwart he once was. Whomever Edwards decides is the weakest link on Los Angeles' defense, he will attack nonstop, and he will have no shortage of soft targets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nConversely, if the Lakers can bottle up Edwards, prepare yourself for a hefty load of Randle, and that is no recipe for playoff success. Edwards will switch off Finney-Smith and into more advantageous pick-and-roll matchups, where he nets 1.02 points per possession. Is that enough to counter the firepower of Dončić, James and Reaves? That will depend on how weak the Lakers' weakest link is and whether Edwards can be as successful against it as the Lakers' offensive trio will be against a stronger defense. — Rohrbach\n\nWolves-Lakers series preview, schedule and prediction\n\nMatchup to watch: The Clippers vs. Jamal Murray\n\nL.A. can’t “stop” Jokić — or even really slow him down. What they can do, though, is try to limit the fallout by cutting off Denver’s other scorers. That means Murray.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nDenver went 24-11 when Murray scored 20 or more points this season, and just 17-15 when he didn’t. Murray also just missed six straight games with a right hamstring injury; he returned for the final two games of the regular season, but shot just 11-of-28 from the floor in them.\n\nMaybe the six days between the regular-season finale and Game 1 will give Murray enough rest and practice time to reach top form by tipoff. But Lue’s going to make him prove it.\n\nExpect Murray to see a lot of Kris Dunn, an elite point-of-attack menace — tied for 10th in the NBA in steals and 17th in deflections per game, second in defensive estimated plus-minus — who limited Murray to just three points on four shots across 59 partial possessions during the regular season. The Clips also have plenty of other big, long options to throw at Murray off the bench: Derrick Jones Jr., Amir Coffey, Ben Simmons, maybe Nicolas Batum (who did yeoman’s work against Jalen Brunson last spring). — Devine\n\nClippers-Nuggets series preview, schedule and prediction"

ESPN will also present special programming celebrating Corso in the days leading up to Aug. 30 (date/time TBD).\n\nCorso, who turns 90 in August, has been a part of college football’s premier pregame show since it debuted in 1987. His very first headgear pick was October 5, 1996, when he donned Ohio State’s Brutus Buckeye mascot head in Columbus, Ohio. Corso’s weekly end-of-show pick during GameDay’s Saturday Selections has become a college football tradition, surprising and delighting fans for nearly three decades. Entering his final broadcast in August, Corso has made 430 headgear picks all-time, including the Buckeyes a record 45 times.\n\n“My family and I will be forever indebted for the opportunity to be part of ESPN and College GameDay for nearly 40 years,” said Corso. “I have a treasure of many friends, fond memories and some unusual experiences to take with me into retirement.”\n\nCorso added: “ESPN has been exceptionally generous to me, especially these past few years. They accommodated me and supported me, as did my colleagues in the early days of College GameDay. Special thanks to Kirk Herbstreit for his friendship and encouragement. And lest I forget, the fans…truly a blessing to share this with them. ESPN gave me this wonderful opportunity and provided me the support to ensure success. I am genuinely grateful.”\n\n“Lee Corso has developed a special connection to generations of fans through his entertaining style and iconic headgear picks,” said ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro. “Lee is one of the most influential and beloved figures in the history of college football and our ESPN team will celebrate his legendary career during his final College GameDay appearance this August.”\n\nCorso joined ESPN in 1987, following a 28-year coaching career at the college and professional levels – including 17 seasons as a head coach at Louisville (1969-72), Indiana (1973-82), Northern Illinois (1984) and with the USFL’s Orlando Renegades (1985). He is the only original College GameDay personality still with the show. (He was a contributor in 1987-88 and joined as an analyst in 1989). During his tenure, College GameDay has earned nine Sports Emmy awards in the Most Outstanding Studio Show – Weekly category and is nominated again this year.\n\nAlongside host Chris Fowler and Craig James, Corso was part of College GameDay’s first-ever road show on November 13, 1993 as No. 2 Notre Dame hosted No. 1 Florida State in the ‘Game of the Century’. In front of a packed crowd inside the Joyce Center in South Bend, Ind., Corso – a Florida State alum and a former star defensive back for the Seminoles in the 1950s, knew exactly how to stir the crowd, placing an FSU cap on his head as he offered his game prediction.\n\n“It has been among the greatest joys and privileges of my life to work with, laugh with, and learn from Lee Corso for more than 35 incredible years,” said Fowler, who hosted College GameDay and worked side-by-side with Corso from 1990-2014. “His courage and resilience have inspired millions. Through his groundbreaking work on College GameDay, Lee has been an indelible force in the growth of college football’s popularity. He’s a born entertainer and singular television talent. But at his heart he’ll always be a coach, with an abiding love and respect for the game and the people who play it.”\n\nDuring Corso’s coast-to-coast travels with College GameDay, he has entertained crowds on more than 70 campuses and other game sites and made headgear picks spanning 69 different teams. He coined the memorable catchphrase, “Not so fast, my friend!” while holding his signature Dixon Ticonderoga No. 2 pencil. The indelible moments he has authored are endless: He’s danced with the Fighting Irish’s leprechaun, ridden a motorcycle with the Oregon Duck, mounted a 17-foot fake elephant, sparred with pop star Katy Perry, wrestled with actors Bill Murray and Will Ferrell, dressed as James Madison, Ben Franklin, the Statue of Liberty and Elvis Presley, and so much more – even notoriously dropping an F-bomb on-air (whoops!).\n\nWhile fans have been enthralled by Corso’s football knowledge and showmanship, they’ve also been moved by the special father-son type bond he shares with Herbstreit. Corso mentored the former Ohio State quarterback when he joined the show in 1996, and when they called Thursday Night college football games together with Mike Tirico from 1999-2006. Herbstreit has been Corso’s biggest supporter on-set and behind the scenes, especially as Corso has overcome a stroke and other health-related issues in recent years.\n\n“Coach Corso has had an iconic run in broadcasting, and we’re all lucky to have been around to witness it. He has taught me so much throughout our time together, and he’s been like a second father to me,” said Herbstreit, who has worked alongside Corso for 29 seasons on College GameDay. “It has been my absolute honor to have the best seat in the house to watch Coach put on that mascot head each week.”\n\nCorso is a member of the athletic Halls of Fame at Florida State, Louisville and Indiana, in addition to the state of Florida Sports Hall of Fame and the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame. In 2006, he received the Florida State Alumni Association’s Gold Medal, the university’s highest alumni honor, and in 2010 the National College Football Awards Association (NCFAA) honored him with the Contributions to College Football Award in recognition of his lifetime of achievement and integrity in the sport. Last fall when GameDay traveled to Bloomington, Ind., the mayor proclaimed it “Coach Lee Corso Day” in his honor as friends, family members, former players and coaches returned to campus.\n\n“Lee is the quintessential entertainer, but he was also a remarkable coach who established lifelong connections with his players,” said Rece Davis, host of College GameDay and a teammate of Corso’s since 2015. “When GameDay went to Indiana last season, the love and emotion that poured out from his players was truly moving. It was also unsurprising. Every week, Lee asks about our families. He asks for specifics. He celebrates success and moments, big and small, with all of us on the set. He’s relentless in his encouragement. That’s what a great coach, and friend, does. Lee has made it his life’s work to bring joy to others on the field and on television. He succeeded.”\n\nWhen College GameDay kicks off Week 1 of the 2025 season on Aug. 30, the three-hour show (9 a.m. – noon ET, ESPN & ESPNU) will honor and celebrate Corso’s historic career in addition to previewing all the day’s big games. Show details will be announced in the coming months.\n\nAdditional details about College GameDay’s 2025 road shows, talent roster and how the show will approach its final segment each week once Corso retires will be announced closer to the start of the college football season.\n\nLee Corso on ESPN’s College GameDay – By the Numbers:\n\n430 mascot headgear selections all-time 286-144 record all-time (.665 win pct.)\n\nCorso has donned the headgear of 69 different teams all-time\n\nMost headgear selections by team: Ohio State – 45 Alabama – 38 LSU – 25 Florida – 22 Oregon – 21\n\n\n\nMilestone headgear picks for Corso: 1st: Oct. 5, 1996 – Ohio State (over Penn State) * 100th: Sept. 17, 2005 – Florida State (over Boston College) * 200th: Oct. 22, 2011 – Wisconsin (over Michigan State) 300th: Oct. 7, 2017 – TCU (over West Virginia) * 400th: Sept. 16, 2023 – Colorado (over Colorado State) *\n\n\n\n* Correct picks\n\nFun Facts:\n\nCollege GameDay has originated from the Army-Navy game nine times. A former Navy assistant coach (1966-68), Corso has never picked against the Midshipmen. There are only three teams that Corso has picked multiple times and never lost: USC (17-0), Virginia Tech (4-0) and North Dakota State (3-0). Corso went a perfect 11-0 on his headgear picks in 1999, his most wins without a loss in a single season since he began the tradition on the show.\n\n\n\n-30-"

            "content": "When it comes to actually storing the numerical weights that power a large language model's underlying neural network, most modern AI models rely on the precision of 16- or 32-bit floating point numbers. But that level of precision can come at the cost of large memory footprints (in the hundreds of gigabytes for the largest models) and significant processing resources needed for the complex matrix multiplication used when responding to prompts.\n\nNow, researchers at Microsoft's General Artificial Intelligence group have released a new neural network model that works with just three distinct weight values: -1, 0, or 1. Building on top of previous work Microsoft Research published in 2023, the new model's \"ternary\" architecture reduces overall complexity and \"substantial advantages in computational efficiency,\" the researchers write, allowing it to run effectively on a simple desktop CPU. And despite the massive reduction in weight precision, the researchers claim that the model \"can achieve performance comparable to leading open-weight, full-precision models of similar size across a wide range of tasks.\"\n\nWatching your weights\n\nThe idea of simplifying model weights isn't a completely new one in AI research. For years, researchers have been experimenting with quantization techniques that squeeze their neural network weights into smaller memory envelopes. In recent years, the most extreme quantization efforts have focused on so-called \"BitNets\" that represent each weight in a single bit (representing +1 or -1).\n\nThe new BitNet b1.58b model doesn't go quite that far—the ternary system is referred to as \"1.58-bit,\" since that's the average number of bits needed to represent three values (log(3)/log(2)). But it sets itself apart from previous research by being \"the first open-source, native 1-bit LLM trained at scale,\" resulting in a 2 billion token model based on a training dataset of 4 trillion tokens, the researchers write.\n\nThe \"native\" bit is key there, since many previous quantization efforts simply attempted after-the-fact size reductions on pre-existing models trained at \"full precision\" using those large floating-point values. That kind of post-training quantization can lead to \"significant performance degradation\" compared to the models they're based on, the researchers write. Other natively trained BitNet models, meanwhile, have been at smaller scales that \"may not yet match the capabilities of larger, full-precision counterparts,\" they write."

            "description": "ChatGPT is getting remarkably good at identifying locations in photos, even suggesting specific addresses in our test.",
            "content": "ChatGPT users have discovered that the popular AI chatbot can serve as a reverse-location search tool. In other words, you can show ChatGPT a picture, and it can pretty reliably tell you where it was taken. The trend is inspired by the online game Geoguessr, where folks try to figure out a location from a simple web image.\n\nWe decided to put this new ChatGPT trend to the test, and the results were downright scary. Mashable tech reporters prompted ChatGPT to play a geo-guessing game and uploaded a series of photos. Even when ChatGPT identified the wrong location, it still got pretty close (such as identifying a rooftop hotel in Buffalo instead of Rochester). In other cases, it suggested specific addresses.\n\nChatGPT's new reasoning models are getting smarter\n\nThis week, OpenAI introduced its newest ChatGPT reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini, with improved visual reasoning. OpenAI also recently made its image generator available to free users. That's led to a number of ChatGPT-based viral trends. People have used it to turn their pets into humans or themselves into action figures, for instance. The reverse location trend, however, is a bit more complicated — and concerning from a privacy standpoint.\n\nThe trend started when folks online realized that ChatGPT has become proficient at guessing a location just by analyzing a photo. Ethan Mollick, a professor who researches AI, posted an example on X where ChatGPT was able to correctly guess where he was driving despite the fact that he stripped the image of location info. (Images often contain metadata that includes precise location data.)\n\nMollick noted that this ability also shows off the capabilities of agentic AI, which allows AI models to reason out answers in multiple steps and perform more complicated tasks such as web searches.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

First, we uploaded a recent photo of a flower shop taken in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. ChatGPT was able to deduce the photo was taken in Brooklyn. It incorrectly thought the image was of a specific flower shop about seven miles away from the true location.\n\nWe then uploaded a photo taken from a car on a recent trip to Japan, and ChatGPT's new o3 model was able to identify the exact location. \"Final answer:📍 Arashiyama, Kyoto, Japan, near the Togetsukyo Bridge, looking across the Katsura River.\"\n\nThe prompt... Credit: Screenshot courtesy of OpenAI ...and the correct answer. Credit: Screenshot courtesy of ChatGPT\n\nWhen we ran the same prompt with an older reasoning model, the results were much more general: \"Given the combination of mountainous terrain, the style of the guardrail, the road, and the overall setting, this looks very much like it could be Japan...The scenery is reminiscent of the areas around Kyoto or Nara, where the countryside meets historic and cultural sites.\"\n\nWe then took things a step further. We uploaded screenshots from the profile of a popular Instagram model — the type of person who would have genuine concerns about privacy and stalkers. With the latest reasoning models, ChatGPT correctly identified the general location, even suggesting specific high-rise apartments, and in one case, a specific home address.\n\nNow, to be fair, the address in question is a home popular among influencers and TV productions, but the specificity was impressive. And a bit scary. It's yet another reason to be careful about what you post online — AI can now help folks deduce where you're located.\n\nOpenAI has said ChatGPT's reverse location abilities could prove helpful, while also acknowledging privacy concerns.\n\n\"OpenAI o3 and o4-mini bring visual reasoning to ChatGPT, making it more helpful in areas like accessibility, research, or identifying locations in emergency response,\" an OpenAI spokesperson wrote in an email to Mashable. \"We’ve worked to train our models to refuse requests for private or sensitive information, added safeguards intended to prohibit the model from identifying private individuals in images, and actively monitor for and take action against abuse of our usage policies on privacy.”"

Similar drive restrictions are already in place for XS Plus and rack-mounted Synology models, though work-arounds exist.\n\nSynology also says it will later add a \"carefully curated drive compatibility framework\" for third-party drives and that users can submit drives for testing and documentation. \"Drives that meet Synology’s stringent standards may be validated for use, offering flexibility while maintaining system integrity.\""

            "content": "The Nintendo Switch 2 uses MicroSD Express cards—a faster and better version of the old MicroSD cards used on the Switch and other devices—to store downloaded games. But it might be tricky to buy one of these tiny storage chips, as they have started selling out since the Switch 2's reveal.\n\nThis Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans\n\nThis Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans\n\nEarlier this month, Nintendo finally unveiled the Switch 2. The new console will cost $450 and will feature a bigger screen, more powerful hardware, and will have a fancy new button dedicated to chatting with friends online. The Switch 2 will also be able to play more visually impressive games, like Cyberpunk 2077, and will sport shorter loading times, too. However, to pull this off, Nintendo upgraded the Switch 2's storage and now the upcoming device requires faster MicroSD Express cards. And people are buying up so many, so quickly, that some stores are running low or completely selling out of the storage cards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs reported by Tom’s Hardware, shortly after the Switch 2's reveal on April 2, physical and online stores began seeing their stock of Express cards sell like hotcakes. Staff at one store in Japan claimed that they were selling over 330 cards ever hour after the Switch 2’s announcement.\n\nNintendo\n\nMicroSD Express card aren’t new tech. They have been around since at least 2019 and have generally been pretty easy to buy over the last few years. However, there really wasn’t a need to upgrade to the faster cards, and the high prices on them—they often cost more than twice as much—meant they had never really become popular among consumers. So this sudden wave of interest in Express cards from people planning to buy a Switch 2 has likely caught stores, factories, and suppliers off guard. That has led to shortages, delays, and places selling out entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI checked Amazon and found many Express cards out of stock. Best Buy seemed to have some, but that could change as Switch 2 pre-orders go live next week and more people start committing to upgrading.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd we likely can’t blame scalpers or resellers entirely for the shortages, as it’s reported that 80 percent of customers are just buying one card. It’s more likely that a product that had never seen mass adoption from consumers is now selling out as there wasn’t a ton of stock sitting around. And with the ongoing threat of President Trump issuing more tariffs, it might continue to be hard to get your hands on a MicroSD Express card for your Switch 2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n.\n\n"

            "content": "The results are in: A lot of us really like Blue Prince. The game about solving puzzles in an ever-shifting manor takes a bit to get going, but once you’re in, you’re in. Data from Steam players — where the game seems to be the most popular — backs this up, according to a LinkedIn post by Alinea Analytics analyst Rhys Elliott.\n\nWhile we won’t know official numbers, Elliott says Blue Prince sales on PlayStation and Xbox are “very low right now,” but that almost 150,000 people have played it. Elliott suspects the low sales stem from the game being available on Game Pass and PlayStation Plus.\n\nOn Steam, the game peaked at over 15,000 concurrent players and is now hovering around 13,000, according to SteamDB. Steam global achievement stats tell us that almost 20% of those players have completed the game’s main goal of reaching room 46 of the 45-room mansion.\n\nGraphic: Alinea Analytics\n\nAccording to Elliott, just over 25% of Steam players have spent 20 to 50 hours in the game since it was released just eight days ago. These are the players who have probably pushed past the opening hours, full of dead-end rooms and unsolved puzzles, and see how deep the rabbit holes go. The percentage of players who have only just touched the surface is slightly lower at 24%.\n\nSteam reviews can be pretty volatile when a game is fresh, but Blue Prince has held onto a “very positive” rating with over 2,500 reviews. Elliott points out that 57% of Blue Prince players also played Balatro, which makes sense if you think about how similar drafting rooms is to drawing cards. Both games have roguelike elements too, so it’s no surprise the same types of players are attracted to them.\n\nAll of this means that there are a lot of Blue Prince fans that could join us in trying to answer our biggest question about it: Why is there only one bathroom in that giant mansion?"

Not to mention that I’d be disappointed in you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes quite a while to accomplish everything in Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree. Opting to complete the entire trophy or achievement list will require you to spend hours working toward reaching level 100, unlocking all bestiary information, claiming all bounties, and even petting every cat in the game. That’s before factoring in the need to collect every weapon, ring, and diagram. Oh, yeah, and you’ll have to kill 10,000 enemies. No biggie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoing all of this, as well as fulfilling a variety of other requirements, will take dedicated players 40+ hours. That sounds like quite an undertaking, but for anyone who loves the dopamine rush that comes from knowing you’ve truly done it all (or, ya know, hearing the ding of a platinum trophy), it might just be worth the time investment!\n\nMandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs."

            "content": "Aitor Diago/Getty Images\n\nA sophisticated phishing scam is taking advantage of Google security flaws to convince people that the malicious emails and website are legitimate.\n\nIn a series of X posts spotted by Android Authority, developer Nick Johnson explained how he was targeted by a phishing attack that exploits flaws in Google's own infrastructure. In his first post, Johnson includes a screenshot of the scam email claiming that Google had been served a subpoena requiring it to produce a copy of his Google account data.\n\nAlso: Clicked on a phishing link? 7 steps to take immediately to protect your accounts\n\nThe text of the email reads correctly; that is, it uses the right terms and doesn't contain any typos or broken English. The message itself is considered valid and signed by Google. It's sent from no-reply@google.com, a legitimate, automated company-used address. The email itself passes the DKIM signature check, which aims to verify the authenticity of a message. No other warnings appear, so this looks completely legitimate.\n\nClicking a Sites link in the email takes you to a support portal that looks like an actual Google page. The page is even hosted on Google Sites, a platform where people can create and run their own websites. Using such a platform adds legitimacy to the scam as people assume it's the real deal.\n\nClicking a link to \"Upload additional documents\" or \"View case\" takes you to a sign-in screen, which also looks like it comes from Google. At this point, there is one tip-off that this could be a scam. As Johnson notes, the sign-in screen is hosted on Google Sites instead of a Google account page, where you normally log in.\n\nThat's when Johnson ended the process. Had he entered his username and password, his presumption is that the attackers would have stolen his login credentials and used them to compromise his Google account.\n\n\"This recent phishing attack exploits legitimate Google features to send crafted emails that bypass some traditional checks, as well as leverage Google Sites to host spoofed pages and harvest credentials,\" said Melissa Bischoping, head of security research at cybersecurity firm Tanium.\n\n\"The email leveraged an OAuth application combined with a creative DKIM workaround to bypass the types of safeguards meant to protect against this exact type of phishing attempt,\" explained Bischoping. \"What makes this tactic particularly dangerous isn't just the technical sleight of hand, but the deliberate use of trusted services to slip past both users and detection tools.\"\n\nThe blame for this scam should obviously be aimed squarely at the scammers themselves. But Google is also on the hook, as this exploit is possible due to a couple of security vulnerabilities.\n\nAlso: The best VPN extensions for Chrome: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nFirst, Google Sites is a legacy product that still allows for arbitrary scripts and embeds, according to Johnson. This weakness could allow an attacker to add arbitrary and malicious code and embedded objects to a web page. Second, closer inspection of the email reveals that it came not from Google but from a privateemail.com address. That raises the question of how and why Google signed it in the first place.\n\nAfter receiving the scam email, Johnson said he contacted Google to alert them to the vulnerabilities. Initially, the company apparently brushed aside his concerns, claiming that all of this was intended behavior. But then Google reversed its stance and has since indicated that it will fix these bugs.\n\n\"More threat actors are deliberately choosing to leverage services that have very legitimate business use cases, underscoring the trend that, as detection tools get stronger, adversaries are looking for ways to evade detection altogether, not necessarily outsmart them with expensive exploits,\" Bischoping said. \"They're focusing on the tools, sites, and functions organizations use in their daily work. By blending in with normal traffic, and the likelihood that a typical recipient won't look that closely at a trusted domain like 'google.com,' threat actors have a high rate of success without significant investment.\"\n\nThanks go to Johnson for not only catching this scam and warning people but for pressing Google to resolve the issue. Until a fix is rolled out, however, how can you protect yourself against such sophisticated phishing attacks?\n\nAlso: Data-stealing cyberattacks are surging - 7 ways to protect yourself and your business\n\nThomas Richards, infrastructure security practice director at security provider Black Duck, offers the following recommendations.\n\nBeware of any email that urges immediate action and tells you you might face negative consequences. This is typically a sign that the email is malicious. Check the \"from\" and \" to\" email addresses. If the \" from\" domain isn't the actual company or the \"to\" recipient is not you, the email is likely a scam. Avoid clicking on links in the email. In the attack described by Johnson, the malicious site is hosted on a Google domain. However, Google would never send you a legal complaint and then direct you to the Google Sites domain. If you're in doubt, log into your Google account separately without clicking on any link and see if any messages or alerts are waiting for you. Finally, run an online search for the content of the email. That can tell you if others have reported it as a scam or received a similar email.\n\nStay ahead of security news with Tech Today, delivered to your inbox every morning."

            "description": "The best watch for iPhone.",
            "content": "The newest Apple Watch has dropped down to the lowest price we've seen. For a limited time, you can pick up a 42mm Apple Watch Series 10 for only $299 - 25% off its $399 list price - or the bigger 46mm model for $329 - 23% off its $429 list price. If you own an iPhone, the Apple Watch is indisputably the best smartwatch for you. It's stylish, boasts excellent build quality, excels as both a fitness tracker and smartwatch, and seamlessly integrates with your iPhone.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 is the newest generation mainstream model (the Watch Series 11 isn't expected until September of this year). Improvements over the Apple Watch Series 9 include a bigger OLED Retina display, a new S10 processor (that isn't faster but it's thinner, which allows the watch itself to have a slimmer profile), a slightly larger base model size (42mm vs. 41mm), and some admittedly trivial features like a water depth gauge. If you do already own an Apple Watch Series 9, there's probably not enough reason here to upgrade. But if this is your first time purchasing an Apple Watch, the Series 10 is definitely the best Apple Watch for most people.\n\nCompared to the Apple Watch SE, the Apple Watch Series 10 boasts a larger size (42mm vs. 40mm), a bigger display with Always-On functionality, a 30% more powerful processor, double the storage, more advanced fitness tracking and body monitoring sensors, double-tap gesture support, and faster charging. The Apple Watch SE is substantially more affordable at $199 currently on Amazon, but I think the upgrades are more than worth it for most people.\n\nCan You Use an Apple Watch with Android Phones?\n\nAlthough it's technically possible to use an Apple Watch with an Android phone, we wouldn't recommend it. Apple made it so that a lot of the functionality of the Apple Watch requires a smartphone with an iOS operating system. There are some workarounds to implement some of the features, but for the average person, the hassle isn't worth it. If you're absolutely intent on getting an Apple Watch, then getting an iPhone first would be the best option. For those of you quite happy with your Android smartphone, there are plenty of Android smartwatches that would be a better fit than the Apple Watch.\n\nMore Deals in Amazon's Spring Sale\n\nPlenty of Apple products are on sale right now, including several generations of AirPods. Otherwise, one of the most popular deals in the sale is Amazon's \"Buy 3 for the Price of 2\" on books, vinyl, and physical movie releases.\n\nWhy Should You Trust IGN's Deals Team?

As a result, when Disney acknowledges the series, even in small ways, it can feel significant, like a reminder that the game is still coming and in active development over at Square. That’s why Kingdom Hearts fans are having a moment over a 10-hour-long lo-fi music video Disney uploaded to its YouTube channel.\n\nWhat Is Dragonsplague? Dragon’s Dogma 2’s Devastating Contagion Explained CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish What Is Dragonsplague? Dragon’s Dogma 2’s Devastating Contagion Explained\n\n2025 is the 30th anniversary of A Goofy Movie. If you’ve never seen it, the movie is an excellent father-son romp starring Goofy and his son Max, and it also has some incredible musical bangers. Though the movie wasn’t a huge success at the box office, it managed to gain a cult following after it was released on VHS. To celebrate the anniversary, Disney has released a documentary on the making of the movie, Not Just A Goof, on Disney+, and also put out a lo-fi ambiance video of Max studying that you can listen to while you study or work. I’ve got it open in my browser now, and maybe there is something to these videos. This is a vibe.\n\nDisney\n\nWhile the comments are turned off on the video itself, if you look around social media platforms like TikTok and X (formerly Twitter), you’ll find eagle-eyed Kingdom Hearts fans yapping about a few things on and around Max’s desk. The mug full of pencils has two stickers on it that appear to be the sea-salt ice cream and paopu fruit, two pieces of iconography from the Kingdom Hearts series. On the wall next to it, there appears to be an image of Twilight Town, a major location in the RPGs. While Goofy has been a mainstay in the Kingdom Hearts series for over 20 years, Max has never made an appearance in the games after all this time. Does he not exist in the Kingdom Hearts universe? Goofy’s never mentioned him, at least. But either way, it looks like he’s a fan of his dad’s multiverse adventures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatever the case, Kingdom Hearts fans are wondering if this is just a cute nod to the series or if it could be a sign that Max will finally make his debut in the series in Kingdom Hearts IV. Could it also mean that Kingdom Hearts news could be imminent?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you’ve never played Kingdom Hearts, almost all of the games are finally on Steam if you want to see what all the fuss is about.

I pulled double-duty on both This Week in... columns, not unlike that time an ongoing story in Kamen Rider Gaim was interrupted for a Kikaider plug. We were talking about porn! It was a fascinating conversation, and I hope we didn't give our dear editor too many grey hairs over it all. You may have heard over on my Bluesky that I rolled credits on Xenoblade Chronicles 3 . I hope you'll forgive me for not giving my thoughts yet—I don't think I'll \"really\" be done with it until I beat Future Connected . Bear with me. With any luck, I'll get to Xenoblade Chronicles X before summer hits.\n\n...But I must say, that was a damn fine ending.\n\nThis is...\n\nSony Raises PlayStation 5 Prices Abroad\n\nThe discourse on the Switch 2 has gone entirely out of control. While the US$450 price is on the higher-end of what people are willing to expect, the US$80 price tag on certain Switch 2 titles has led to the kind of outrage where misinformation absolutely festers , from some claims that some Switch 2 games would cost US$90 (no idea where that one comes from, maybe folks were confusing the European prices?) to sabers being rattled at the Game Key cards (even though other publishers are adopting similar methods). That the Japanese Switch 2 is priced at about US$330 is now cited as evidence that Nintendo is \"being greedy,\" never mind that the yen is still extremely weak at the moment. It's led to a whole discourse that, throughout a weekend, seemed to lose sight of any nuance outside of \"DROP THE PRICE,\" which I'm sure is cathartic to spam in a chat. Not sure what it'll do in the long run, though. With all the discourse over the Switch 2's price, the smart thing for Sony and Microsoft would be to sit back on their laurels and do nothing. Decreasing the price on the PS5 might even make it more appealing than a Switch 2—\n\n—or, they can raise the price of the PS5. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSony announced the price hike on their official blog this Sunday , before the work week even had a chance to start. The raise applies to PS5s sold in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, with prices of €499, $829.95, and $949.95, respectively. If it sounds silly to you, don't worry—it does to me, too. But also: if you bought the digital version, the separate disk trays have the same price. Yay...?\n\nThe educated guess as to the reasoning behind the price hike is simple: a significant portion of the gaming industry's sales is based in the United States. The gaming industry is facing losses courtesy of the tariffs President Trump has imposed on video game consoles. Sony is looking to make up for lost profits through sales in other regions. Again, as I said, this does seem silly, especially since the PlayStation 5 is a five-year-old console . At this point, most people would be thinking about what a possible PlayStation 6 might be like. With the consternation over the $450 Switch 2, a real slam-dunk would've been selling a PS5 at a lower price. Sure, keep the PS5 Pro at eye-gouging prices, if you have to (those graphical updates are minimal anyway). But a PS5 at $400, while Nintendo sells a $450 console, is some kind of competition. As the joke goes, the PS5 \"has no games.\" That's bullcrap, by the way— Sony has a wealth of older titles on their virtual storefront that are more than worth the price, like the Dark Cloud games or Valkyrie Profile . But Sony only seems to trot those games out as cameos for Astro Bot .\n\nConsoles were always going to get more expensive in the wake of the tariffs. I know people who were excited at the notion of snubbing the Switch 2 by just buying other consoles—or just making a PC. But of course, the same tariffs and economic factors that led to a Switch 2 price hike mean that everything else will also become more expensive. I didn't expect Sony to come out and up-sell their console, especially not in regions where their consoles are already priced as luxury goods. It needs to be said that Sony didn't have to do this, especially not on hardware that's this old or is already struggling with its value proposition. This is a fine case of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nA lot of discussion is about how gaming is being priced out of the hands of many. I think the sad truth is that this was already happening; I hear so many people insisting that you don't \"need\" to spend four figures on components for a decent gaming rig, only for the latest triple-A game to have been made with the latest GPU's in mind, so you probably want the top-of-the-line chips if you want Monster Hunter Wilds to run correctly. And the PS5 was already not cheap; as detailed in a column from a few months ago, the PS5 Pro already retails for $1400 in New Zealand—and it not only doesn't include a physical disk drive, it doesn't even include a godforsaken stand . There's a reason so many people from Europe or Canada looked at Americans panicking over $80 games—they've been paying that much for games for ages . Add to that people who in this day and age live paycheck-to-paycheck—or worse, are homeless (yes, homeless people like games too).\n\nI don't know how much a $450 Nintendo Switch will cost when it finally launches this summer, but even at the European rate of €469.99, it's still a lot less than a PS5...\n\nMarvel vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Gets An Update...?\n\nTekken 8 recent \"Defensive Patch\" might have players up in arms, but CAPCOM throws its hat into the ring with surprising updates with... a patch for Marvel vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics . This is wild and surprising, especially since it's a patch for several old games. It's not often that older collections like these get this kind of TLC, especially considering the extensiveness of the patches...\n\nThe patch comes with new art for the art gallery, illustrated by beloved fighting game artist Shinkiro. Shinkiro is regarded as a legend in the space of fighting game art, so this is a neat bit of fan service. The patch also includes new remixed songs for Captain America, Captain Commando, Cyclops, and my boy Jin Saotome. (This is the closest we'll get to a new Cyberbots game...)\n\nPlayers can also look forward to many quality-of-life updates that will make fighting game aficionados happy. First, you can press and hold a button to open the menu mid-fight. You can also reset the game straight from the menu, making things a lot easier when you're trying to set up fights. There is now an offline Versus mode for every game in the collection, making tournament play a snap. If you're playing Marvel vs. CAPCOM 2 , the game now includes options for improved resolutions to improve the old 3D visuals in the backgrounds.\n\nThe real treat that has old-school pugilists thrilled is the option to access X-Men vs. Street Fighter 's various builds (960910, 961004, and 961023). This is big! Many of the older ports for X-Men vs. Street Fighter only handled the latest version of the game (961023). While it's not the worst version of the game, the earlier builds are preferred by many players because it is a lot easier to pull off tech. Players can choose whichever version they want to play. This is a great move for video game archiving, to say nothing of the options it gives people trying to set up local tournaments.\n\nMost importantly, it's an excellent show of faith from CAPCOM . It's not very common to see a collection get this extensive of a patch, let alone with all of the extra goodies (the artwork and music, specifically). They're committed to making these collections as complete as possible. This is a good show and inspiring to hear regarding CAPCOM 's other collections.\n\nWell that is the nail in the coffin. Now I get to go to bed angry... They added the EO note today by the way. How crazy that they running this off an Arcade Rom, but EO is ranked... I just can't right now@JWonggg @maximilian_ pic.twitter.com/2V6t2NWsn6 — Silentscope88 (@silentscope88) April 16, 2025\n\nA least it would, until further updates came out later in the week. Remember how X-Men vs. Street Fighter had several versions? Well, so does CAPCOM vs. SNK 2 in the CAPCOM Fighting Collection 2 set. Normally, this isn't an issue: the main version of the game that you play is the arcade version. The problem originates from the online ranked mode; for some reason, it runs on the later \"Easy Operation\" version of CAPCOM vs. SNK 2 . Much like with X-Men vs. Street Fighter , the \"EO\" version, as it's known, is fairly maligned among the fighting game community. Long story short, the EO version doesn't feature an exploit known as \"roll cancelling,\" which makes the game less enjoyable for many seasoned pros. More puzzling is that the collection defaults to this version of CAPCOM vs. SNK 2 . A lot of figures in the fighting game community are raising awareness of the issue, so hopefully CAPCOM can offer some extra options down the line for folks who don't want to play the EO version. I encourage folks to respectfully throw their hat into the ring and let CAPCOM know of their desire for better options, if they're so inclined.\n\nMagical Princess Lines Up To Fill Void Left by Princess Maker\n\nThroughout this column, we've touched on several major video games that have massively influenced Japanese gaming but get almost no lip service in the United States—think Tokimeki Memorial or Angelique . Part of the issue is that these games have never been made available in the United States for American fans to enjoy—but it looks like we'll have an alternative for one famous formative title!\n\nMagical Princess comes to us from Neotro Inc. and Magi Inc. Here, you play as a widower raising a daughter on your own, starting from childhood up to her graduation from magic school. Of course, you have tons of choices to make in raising her: you can diligently encourage her to focus on her studies, raising her to be a renowned spellcaster; or you can encourage her to prowl the streets at night, falling in with a colorful band of motorcyclists. Magical Princess boasts about 50 endings, all hinging on the myriad paths your daughter's life can take, from the beloved local baker to the infamous Demon Queen. Along the way, you can introduce your daughter to a wealth of characters for her to befriend or even fall in love with—as well as deck her out in any number of luxurious outfits. Also, your daughter is voiced by actress Sayumi Suzushiro , whom you might recognize as Nijika Ichiji from Bocchi the Rock! .\n\nImage via vocal.media © Studio Gainax\n\nIf this set-up sounds familiar, it's because it's very heavily inspired by the Princess Maker games; a series of simulation games produced by Studio Gainax (yes, the home of Neon Genesis Evangelion and Hanamaru Kindergarten ). The Princess Maker games were huge in their day, and their influences run pretty deep through the gaming industry. I don't have any hard proof of this. Still, I'm pretty sure the Princess Maker games and their emphasis on stat growth-based rearing were a major influence on the original Atelier Marie —which kickstarted the entirety of the Atelier series. The games were just a novel approach towards simulation games: a single parent (nominally a father) given a daughter by a god in the hopes that you'll raise her to be a wise, charitable adult. You can send your daughter to school and have her earn some money working jobs around town, while also sending her off on action-RPG-esque adventures around the world where she fights monsters. The options are extensive, including allowing for your daughter's weight or morality. Once again, your daughter could reach all kinds of goals, such as becoming a writer, a mason, a royal concubine, or an evil goddess! You could also marry your daughter, and the game will look at you sideways for it.\n\nPrincess Maker has a rather esteemed background to it, but the games have all but vanished after Princess Maker 5 in 2007. Gainax made an anime based on the Princess Maker games, Petite Princess Yucie , but that didn't budge the needle much. Princess Maker 2 , by and large the most popular game in the series, got a remaster last year in the form of Princess Maker 2 Regeneration , out on Steam , PlayStation 4, 5, and Nintendo Switch. Heads-up, it's a bit rough, even if it features completely new artwork from the original artist, Takami Akai .\n\nWhich is where Magical Princess comes in. With its 50 endings and myriad decisions in raising your daughter, it's hoped that Magical Princess will do right by Princess Maker 's legacy. It doesn't have a release date yet, but it has a Steam page where you can follow for further updates.\n\nChainsaw Man Director Working On Survival-Horror Game—in Roblox\n\nI don't know what to tell you. Sometimes the news writes itself. If I wanted to fake a news story, I'd do something like, \"New SaGa Game To Feature Monster Designed By Toshio Maeda \" or \" Nobuo Uematsu Reunites With Deep Purple's Ian Gillan For New Song Featured in Final Fantasy XIV Expansion.\" And make no mistake, those are all deep cuts that would blow anyone's mind, but they still feel like they come up short next to this.\n\nRyū Nakayama , better known as the director of MAPPA 's Chainsaw Man adaptation, apparently decided to go into game design. Hence his new project, The Inn : a survival-horror rogue-like where you navigate a randomly-generated haunted inn while evading all manner of ghosts and ghoulies. It's set to feature some big-name voice acting talent, including Asami Seto and Megumi Han . Oh, and it's being made in freaking Roblox .\n\n－ The Inn Trailer －\n\n\n\nFrom the director of Chainsaw Man, Ryu Nakayama @r_nkym_, step into the shadows of a haunted Japanese inn with this new #Roblox roguelite horror game! Coming soon ⛩️ #robloxdev pic.twitter.com/TcB5mgqiFH — The Inn - Roblox (@TheInnRoblox) April 9, 2025\n\nThe reasoning behind the decision to make this game in Roblox evades me; Nakayama himself acknowledges that Roblox is a lot more popular in the United States than it is in Japan. Still, he also voices his desire to give it \"a strong Japanese feel\" (according to Google Translate). Maybe he figured it'd be the easiest way to get the attention of a lot of American fans?\n\nFor what it's worth, The Inn looks rather unrecognizable as a Roblox game; the level seems quite well-designed, and the graphics are somewhat comparable to Fatal Frame . So we certainly can't fault Nakayama and his colleagues at Studio Mayflower for their attention to detail and passion! Currently, there's no word on a release date; Nakayama promises more information soon.\n\nLet's wrap up with some quick tidbits\n\nAo Oni: The Horror of Blueberry Onsen , a re-imagining of the original Ao Oni title, has a Switch release dated for this April 25th. Look forward to Ao Oni with co-op!\n\nThe wait for Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road might finally be at an end! The game has been given an August 21 release date, along with news of releases on the Xbox Series X|S and the Switch 2. Conversely, the iOS and Android versions seem to have been cancelled. Look forward to it on the PS4, PS5, Steam , and Nintendo Switch!\n\nVampire Survivors has another wild crossover set up—and it's with SaGa: Emerald Beyond ! (As it turns out, one of the guys from poncle is a huge fan of SaGa .) The update includes 12 new characters, 16 new weapons, new mechanics for controlling multiple characters, and nine new songs! The pack is completely free for anyone who owns a copy of Vampire Survivor .\n\nThat'll do it for this week, I think. I hope folks enjoyed a double-dose of That Bitch™ throughout this week. I think I'll keep it to a once-in-a-blue-moon thing. I deeply enjoyed my time with This Week in Anime , and the guys there are always a blast to work with, but two columns a week is a lot. I put a lot of pride into my columns. Even though my lived experiences as a gamer are unique from most everyone, especially due to my life growing up in Puerto Rico, I'm proud of the work I put into these columns. I'm proud to see my readers' excitement at certain bits of news. It makes me happy when people feel seen, which is why I make sure to bone up a bit even for stuff I don't know much about. Gaming is for everyone, and it's a much wider world than I can fathom; I learn a lot through this column, and I hope to help you learn a lot too. Be good to each other, I'll see you in seven.\n\nThis Week In Games! is written from idyllic Portland by Jean-Karlo Lemus.

            "content": "The creators of Sunderfolk wanted to make a video game that would help players “Rediscover game night.” By my reckoning, they have succeeded, because I am now regularly arguing with good friends over stupid moves. Why didn’t I pick up that gold? Don’t you see how ending up there messed up an area attack? Ah, well.\n\nThat kind of friendly friction, inside dedicated social time, only gets harder to come by as you get older, settle into routines, and sometimes move apart. I’ve hosted four Sunderfolk sessions with three friends, all in different states, and it has felt like reclaiming something I lost. Sunderfolk is a fun game with a lot of good ideas, and the best one is convincing humans to join up in pondering hex tiles, turn order, and what to name the ogres who shoot arrows (“Pointy Bros”).\n\nMaybe you already have all the gaming appointments you need with friends, online or in person. Sunderfolk, I might suggest, is a worthy addition to your queue as a low-effort way to give everyone a break from being the organizer. It does a decent job of tutorializing and onboarding less experienced players, then adds depth as it goes on. Given that only one person out of four has to own the game on some system, and the only other hardware needed is a phone, it’s a pretty light lift for what I’m finding to be a great payoff. Some parts could be improved, but the core loop and its camaraderie engine feel sturdy.\n\nCredit: Dreamhaven I haven't reached the mine cart missions yet but am glad to know they exist.

You pick from familiar role-playing character classes—my party picked rogue, berserker, wizard, and a kind of pyromancer—and choose one ability card each turn. The cards put a Gloomhaven-like emphasis on sequence and map positioning. One of my rogue’s potential moves is a quick attack, then gaining strength by picking up nearby gold. Another involves moving, hitting, moving, hitting, then one more single-hex move at the end, to stay out of danger and get a protective “Shrouded” effect."

It’s not nearly as blatant as some past examples of how Apple likes to depict Android devices in a degrading way, which is nice progress to see, though that’s likely in part due to the Beats brand being considerably more open to Android users. Beats headphones even support Google’s Fast Pair standard.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nThis Android appearance is alongside several other device types, as Apple and Beats are advertising these cables as “universally compatible,” something that can only be said because Apple was forced to adopt USB-C on the iPhone 15 series by EU regulation. As such, it’s fitting that an iPhone is the last thing shown in that segment of the ad.\n\nAs mentioned, these new USB-C cables from Beats are available now.\n\nMore on Android:\n\nFollow Ben: Twitter/X, Threads, Bluesky, and Instagram"

            "description": "Games benefit greatly from a development team that has worked together for years, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle shows that.",
            "content": "If MachineGames is to be believed, the basement level of the Vatican is exempt from the strict Catholic doctrine that dominates the jurisdiction of the Holy See above ground. It's down there that you'll find the temples dedicated to faiths that sort of resemble Christianity if you squint a bit and turn your head on your side. And the underground boxing ring set up by Mussolini's plundering soldiers, who'll only let you in if you're wearing one of their infamous black shirts.\n\nThe latter is an early test of your ability to get to grips with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's fistfighting system. It's faster than you expect it's going to be, is the thing: both Indy's blows and those in response flying like boulders at terminal velocity. Dodging will get you so far, but don't expect your opponent to keep their arms at their sides while you're pummelling them in the face. To find an advantage, you'll need to block and parry, using both hands rather than sticking to the right trigger, and grabbing hold of your target when they stumble - either to get more hits in, or shove them toward the baying crowd.\n\nBaying being the key term. The core Indiana Jones development team first made a name for themselves back in 2004 with The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. That was a kind of first-person prison drama, about ingratiating yourself with fellow cons, instigating riots and stealing keycards, all in an effort to break yourself out of a triple-max security facility on a barren planet. Guns were a rarity - most of them registered to the DNA of the guard holding them, and so useless to you - and Butcher Bay was celebrated as perhaps the only successful example of hand-to-hand combat in an FPS at the time. In fact, FPS felt like a reductive term for this bold mixture of pugilism, stealth, adventure and conversation.\n\nThe Riddick team went on to make The Darkness, to similar acclaim, and most of its key names either founded MachineGames or joined it later. Their entries in the Wolfenstein canon are notable not only for dual-wielding shootouts, but for the deep characterisation of BJ Blazkowicz and his found family at the Kreisau Circle, as well as the memorable non-combat sequences that brought the player within intimate proximity of detestable villains like Deathshead and Frau Engel. MachineGames perfected a knack for blending b-movie absurdity with real storytelling chops, growing braver with each new project over a decade and a half.\n\nWhich brings us to Indiana Jones, MachineGames' opus. A game every bit as varied as Butcher Bay, if not more so; which boasts gunplay and action as slick as Wolfenstein's, but doesn't rely on it; that couldn't possibly have been made without the shared trust and creative shorthand that exists between a team who know each other as well as they know themselves.\n\nThe punch-ups under the Vatican are a microcosmic demonstration of that team's journey: their long commitment to immersive first-person adventure, and the extraordinary ways in which their creative talent has amplified over time. The ideas that once fuelled Butcher Bay are transformed by a level of fidelity and polish that produces thudding impacts, grimacing faces and flying helmets. The sounds of skirmish are cleverly sequenced, signalling subtly to the player whether or not their blows are connecting. This is a Michelin Star standard of pretend punching, enabled by a team which has stayed together and worked wonders as a result.\n\nLook at the top-rated games of the last few years, and you'll notice that many of them also benefitted from this kind of rolling snowball of experience. Baldur's Gate 3 couldn't have redefined the western RPG had Larian not been layering its systems over the triumphs of the Divinity: Original Sin games. And Original Sin would never have happened were it not for the stubbornness of Larian boss Swen Vincke and his Belgian veterans. They've been riding out the ups and downs of their genre since before the millennium, and are only now seeing the fruits of that devotion.\n\nWould Baldur's Gate 3 have even been possible from a new stuido? | Image credit: Larian\n\nBut the act of keeping teams together, which has always been a challenge in the volatile tech space, has become almost impossible in today's games industry. Since the soaring player numbers that followed the pandemic, game makers have endured a painful contraction. A common developer mantra of \"survive til '25\" now looks grimly quaint and naive, as a dry period of investment in video games continues unabated. Thousands of accomplished projects fight for player attention every year, and it's exceedingly common for studios to close after, or even before, the release of their debut games.\n\nThe margin for error has become invisible to the naked eye, leaving even seasoned teams with little chance to course correct. It's a landscape in which the likes of Arkane Austin can be shut down after a single disappointing game, Redfall, seemingly mangled by a publisher push for multiplayer. The hivemind that produced Prey and Dishonored has been disassembled forever.\n\nThe impact of that instability hasn't necessarily hit us as players yet. We're currently in the enviable position of cherry-picking from an unprecedented stream of five-star releases. Over time though, if publishers don't start to value institutional knowledge over short-term boosts to their share price, I suspect that top tier of releases - the Indiana Joneses, the Baldur's Gate 3s - will cease to occur. More developers will waste their time establishing new studios, filling out forms, designing logos, and repeating the mistakes of the dead studios before them. Newcomers to the industry won't benefit from the teaching of practiced programming or art or level design teams - because those teams will have been scattered to the winds. Building the kind of momentum that MachineGames has? That will become an impossibility.\n\nWhen Obsidian recently said that it plans to reach its 100th birthday as a studio by staying lean and making sensible bets, the plan sounded strange and radical. But it shouldn't. This is the way we get the greatest games ever made: by supporting studios and publishers who reject zero-sum projects; who do everything in their power to keep their creative staff together and look after one another. The best possible outcome, for developers and players alike, would be a Great Circle of 100-year-old game studios that spans the globe."

Looking at the game's store pages, it seems some upcoming titles won't support the Nintendo Switch Online Cloud Save feature — or maybe they will, it's all a bit confusing (thanks for the heads up, Eurogamer).\n\nAs was pointed out in a recent Resetera thread by user RandomlyRandom67, the Tears of the Kingdom Nintendo Switch 2 Edition page on Nintendo's website houses the following disclaimer: \"Please note: this software does not support the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership's Save Data Cloud backup feature\".\n\nYou'll find the same message at the bottom of Nintendo's Donkey Kong Bananza listing, and the original poster claimed it could also be found on the Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition pages, but it seems to have been removed now. Hmm.\n\nWhere things get really confusing, however, is how these disclaimers appear to only be present on the European and North American game listings. Eurogamer noted that no such message appears on the Japanese site for any of the games, muddying the waters even further. Again, hmmmmm.\n\nWe've reached out to Nintendo for a comment on these cloud save shenanigans and will update this article when we hear back.\n\nRemoving the NSO cloud save option from new Switch 2 games is a baffling move, but taking it from the likes of TOTK — which, let's not forget, supported it in its Switch 1 form — makes even less sense. We know that you'll be able to move your original BOTW and TOTK save files over to the Switch 2 editions, but, if the disclaimer is correct, you won't be able to make a new cloud save in the latter once it's there. Surely there's been a mistake here.\n\nWe'll be keeping an eye out for more clarification in the run-up to Switch 2's launch, but until then, cherish you're cloud saves, folks. Who knows how long they'll last?"

This “other player” can be not only a Nintendo Switch 2 owner but a Nintendo Switch owner as well.\n\nGameChat will allow players to easily communicate and collaborate with one another when playing online by using the system’s built-in microphone. Nintendo Switch 2 owners who connect the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera or USB camera to their system will be able to also share their live video as part of the GameChat feature. The camera image will appear on the player indicator UI within the game.\n\nFriends Pass and Cross Play on the Nintendo Switch 2\n\nIn case you missed it, Split Fiction on Nintendo Switch 2 will also support Hazelight Friend’s Pass** feature. Thanks to Friend’s Pass, two players can enjoy Split Fiction together online, but only one of those players needs to own a copy of the game!

            "content": "John Taggart/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWindows 10 is about to expire.\n\nIn less than six months, Microsoft's most successful operating system release ever will reach its end-of-support date. Like Monty Python's Norwegian Blue, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin' choir invisible!\n\nAlso: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 now\n\nHow is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public nearly a decade ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike. And it's continued to be insanely popular more than three years after the release of its successor, Windows 11.\n\nThat's good news, right? Well, not exactly.\n\nMicrosoft has a big challenge on its hands in the run-up to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11. To complicate things, they've departed radically from the normal upgrade rules.\n\nAlso: Microsoft at 50: Its incredible rise, 15 lost years, and stunning comeback - in 4 charts\n\nI wrote the original version of this post in July 2023, when that end date was more than two years in the future, and I've been revisiting the topic regularly to help answer some burning questions.\n\nWhen does Windows 10 support end? Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means most Windows 10 editions -- Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education -- will reach their end-of-support date on Oct. 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see \"When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?\") So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 will continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. Also: Windows 10 PC can't be upgraded? You have 5 options and 6 months to take action From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks. There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on Oct. 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on Oct. 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is Jan. 9, 2029. Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on Jan. 12, 2027. Show more\n\nHow many PCs are running Windows 10 today? If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them? Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics. Also: There's a quiet PC boom happening - thanks to Windows 10 and the tariffs One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the US government's Digital Analytics Program (DAP), which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA. I've been checking that source regularly over the past few years. When I visited DAP at the beginning of April 2025, I retrieved 90 days' worth of data, covering billions of visits to those websites from people using Windows computers, Macs, and mobile devices from all around the world. Here's what the data told me when I filtered it to show only visits from PCs running Windows 10 and Windows 11: Show more\n\nWindows 11 has steadily overtaken Windows 10 in visits to U.S. government websites as the deadline approaches. DAP/ZDNET\n\nThat's a big improvement over an eight-month period. Last August, visits from PCs running Windows 10 significantly outpaced those from Windows 11. (In case you're curious, other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including ChromeOS.)\n\nBut if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. Over the past eight months, about 1.6% of Windows 10 PCs have been replaced by Windows 11 PCs each month. At that pace, about 35% of those 1.4 billion devices will still be running Windows 10 when October 2025 rolls around, and many of them have no supported upgrade path.\n\nAlso: Windows 10 PC can't be upgraded? You have 5 options and 6 months to take action\n\nFor people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is -- well, let's call it unnerving.\n\nAnother widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. If you believe their charts, about 54% of PCs worldwide are still running Windows 10 as of April 2025.\n\nNow, I have my issues with StatCounter's metrics, a topic I have recently discussed at length. I think the StatCounter numbers probably overcount the number of Windows 10 PCs, but they do confirm the general conclusion that there will be a large number of unsupported PCs at the end of 2025.\n\nHow many PCs will be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025? That's the real question, isn't it? Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead. The prospect of large tariffs on PCs manufactured in China and sold in the US complicates the equation considerably. Also: Can't quit Windows 10? You can pay Microsoft for updates after October, or try these alternatives If the shift to Windows 11 continues at its current rate, as measured by the DAP data, roughly 35% of PCs will still be running Windows 10 in October 2025. That adds up to more than 500 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system at the end of the year. I suspect that pace will accelerate significantly, especially in enterprise deployments that have been planning for this transition for the past few years and will be executing on those plans before the end of 2025. Even at that accelerated pace, though, it will still mean hundreds of millions of PCs will be running Windows 10 when the end-of-support date rolls around. Yikes. Who owns those PCs? Those who don't qualify for an automatic upgrade . Some people own older hardware that doesn't meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.\n\n.

            "content": "RTX 50 graphics cards experience 3-6% performance boost with new drivers\n\nReports from synthetic tests.\n\nSource: Reddit/Spiderpig08\n\nThis week, NVIDIA released a large driver update for the RTX series. According to the official changelog, the update resolved many black screen issues and improved stability across various games. However, what NVIDIA did not mention were updates to performance.\n\nReddit users noticed that with the new drivers, their scores were visibly higher. Normally, synthetic benchmarks remain stable unless companies specifically target synthetic tests or are forced to adjust the frequency and voltage curve. Often, this doesn’t improve performance but actually lowers it to enhance stability.\n\nAccording to Spiderpig08 on Reddit, the RTX 5080, running on the most high-end platform available (Ryzen 9 9950X3D), is now up to 6% faster than with previous drivers. Other users also report improvements, with some even claiming to see higher FPS in the same scenes while playing actual games.\n\nUsers also mention that the new drivers improved power efficiency, lowering power consumption while the card is idle (by reducing the clock speed from 180 MHz to just 22 MHz, resulting in a 7W lower consumption).\n\nComputeBase ran all RTX 50 cards through new drivers and they confirm that Steel Nomad does indeed show improvement, especially for RTX 5080 and RTX 5070 series:\n\nRTX 50 with new drivers, Source: ComputerBase\n\nIf you have a similar experience, drop your results below. Here are mine on the RTX 4090: for this card, there’s not even a 1 FPS improvement.\n\nRTX 4090 with new drivers, Source: VideoCardz\n\nSource: ComputerBase, Reddit via Wccftech, TechPowerUP"

            "content": "Welcome to RPG Site's minimalist guide for Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete, the first game in the Lunar Remastered Collection. This classic RPG is rather straightforward by modern standards—progress hinges on talking to the right NPCs and heading to story destinations, though unlike contemporary games, it won’t hold your hand with objective markers (that’s where this guide shines). For Boss Combat, MP management is the key to success. If you enter boss fights with a good amount of MP, you’ll rarely struggle. For trophy hunters, beware two notorious challenges: \"open every red chest\" achievement, and a collection of Bromides (missable items granted by talking to NPCs or examining objects at specific moments).\n\nAdvertisement. Keep scrolling for more\n\nBe warned, this game lacks any auto-save feature. Make a habit of saving manually at every opportunity, and always keep multiple backup saves. If you encounter a Game Over, you’ll revert to your last save.\n\nNote: This guide can also be applied to the original PlayStation release. However, keep in mind that the original Working Designs version includes some gameplay changes, such as boss scaling and reduced silver found in treasure chests. Instructions for getting some of the bromides are also completely different. For instructions on how to get them on the PSX version, it will be highlighted with PSX version text.\n\nMain Walkthrough Table of Contents\n\nBurg\n\nObjective After regaining control, leave and head to the springs to see a movie scene.

The miner you rescued earlier will now reward you with Xenobia’s Bromide. Once you're done with the Frontier, head to your airship for an event. PSX Version Only: When you regain control in Vane, all your party members will be separated. During this part, DO NOT talk to Nash. Instead, go to the Magic Guild and look for a classmate in the bottom right room. Talking to him multiple times should give you Mia's Bromide. Once you have collected the bromide, go to talk to Nash by the entrance. Then meet Mia at the Magic Guild. After the event scene, make your final preparations, such as stocking items. Talk to the Chief in Lann and select the first option. You will get the Ghaleon's Tear accessory from him. This will only work if you remember to visit him when you become a Dragonmaster for the first time. Talk to Lily in Reza. If you remember to talk to her three times when you first visit the Thieves Guild, she will give you the Gale Ring. Visit Damon in Damon Spire, talk to him, and he will give you the Hell Ring.

There are several layers to the dungeon and several event scenes in each layer. When you reach the top, there will be a boss fight. After defeating the boss, talk to Luna for an event. Afterwards, you will return to Meribia. This is the final section to stock up. There are no healing spots in the final dungeon, so bring a hefty amount of Star Light to restore MP. During this part, if you talk to Ramus, he will sell you all his stuff for free. There is a trophy for reaching a 100,000 silver. You should just buy all the Star Light and resell them until you reach 100,000 silver to get the trophy. Ramus will also carry two new bromides in his store. Buy the two bromides, Jessica's Bromide 2 and Mia's Bromide 2. To move on with the story, go to the pub. Talk to Nash and Kyle. Then talk to Mia and Jessica in Mel's Room.

            "description": "Researchers developed a more efficient way to control the outputs of a large language model, guiding it to generate text that adheres to a certain structure, like a programming language, and remains error free.",
            "content": "Programmers can now use large language models (LLMs) to generate computer code more quickly. However, this only makes programmers’ lives easier if that code follows the rules of the programming language and doesn’t cause a computer to crash.\n\nSome methods exist for ensuring LLMs conform to the rules of whatever language they are generating text in, but many of these methods either distort the model’s intended meaning or are too time-consuming to be feasible for complex tasks.\n\nA new approach developed by researchers at MIT and elsewhere automatically guides an LLM to generate text that adheres to the rules of the relevant language, such as a particular programming language, and is also error-free. Their method allows an LLM to allocate efforts toward outputs that are most likely to be valid and accurate, while discarding unpromising outputs early in the process. This probabilistic approach boosts computational efficiency.\n\nDue to these efficiency gains, the researchers’ architecture enabled small LLMs to outperform much larger models in generating accurate, properly structured outputs for several real-world use cases, including molecular biology and robotics.\n\nIn the long run, this new architecture could help nonexperts control AI-generated content. For instance, it could allow businesspeople to write complex queries in SQL, a language for database manipulation, using only natural language prompts.\n\n“This work has implications beyond research. It could improve programming assistants, AI-powered data analysis, and scientific discovery tools by ensuring that AI-generated outputs remain both useful and correct,” says João Loula, an MIT graduate student and co-lead author of a paper on this framework.\n\nLoula is joined on the paper by co-lead authors Benjamin LeBrun, a research assistant at the Mila-Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, and Li Du, a graduate student at John Hopkins University; co-senior authors Vikash Mansinghka ’05, MEng ’09, PhD ’09, a principal research scientist and leader of the Probabilistic Computing Project in the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences; Alexander K. Lew SM ’20, an assistant professor at Yale University; Tim Vieira, a postdoc at ETH Zurich; and Timothy J. O’Donnell, an associate professor at McGill University and a Canada CIFAR AI Chair at Mila, who led the international team; as well as several others. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations.\n\nEnforcing structure and meaning\n\nOne common approach for controlling the structured text generated by LLMs involves checking an entire output, like a block of computer code, to make sure it is valid and will run error-free. If not, the user must start again, racking up computational resources.\n\nOn the other hand, a programmer could stop to check the output along the way. While this can ensure the code adheres to the programming language and is structurally valid, incrementally correcting the code may cause it to drift from the meaning the user intended, hurting its accuracy in the long run.\n\n“It is much easier to enforce structure than meaning. We can quickly check whether something is in the right programming language, but to check its meaning you have to execute the code. Our work is also about dealing with these different types of information,” Loula says.\n\nThe researchers’ approach involves engineering knowledge into the LLM to steer it toward the most promising outputs. These outputs are more likely to follow the structural constraints defined by a user, and to have the meaning the user intends.\n\n“We are not trying to train an LLM to do this. Instead, we are engineering some knowledge that an expert would have and combining it with the LLM’s knowledge, which offers a very different approach to scaling than you see in deep learning,” Mansinghka adds.\n\nThey accomplish this using a technique called sequential Monte Carlo, which enables parallel generation from an LLM to compete with each other. The model dynamically allocates resources to different threads of parallel computation based on how promising their output appears.\n\nEach output is given a weight that represents how likely it is to be structurally valid and semantically accurate. At each step in the computation, the model focuses on those with higher weights and throws out the rest.\n\nIn a sense, it is like the LLM has an expert looking over its shoulder to ensure it makes the right choices at each step, while keeping it focused on the overall goal. The user specifies their desired structure and meaning, as well as how to check the output, then the researchers’ architecture guides the LLM to do the rest.\n\n“We’ve worked out the hard math so that, for any kinds of constraints you’d like to incorporate, you are going to get the proper weights. In the end, you get the right answer,” Loula says.\n\nBoosting small models\n\nTo test their approach, they applied the framework to LLMs tasked with generating four types of outputs: Python code, SQL database queries, molecular structures, and plans for a robot to follow.\n\nWhen compared to existing approaches, the researchers’ method performed more accurately while requiring less computation.\n\nIn Python code generation, for instance, the researchers’ architecture enabled a small, open-source model to outperform a specialized, commercial closed-source model that is more than double its size.\n\n“We are very excited that we can allow these small models to punch way above their weight,” Loula says.\n\nMoving forward, the researchers want to use their technique to control larger chunks of generated text, rather than working one small piece at a time. They also want to combine their method with learning, so that as they control the outputs a model generates, it learns to be more accurate.\n\nIn the long run, this project could have broader applications for non-technical users. For instance, it could be combined with systems for automated data modeling, and querying generative models of databases.\n\nThe approach could also enable machine-assisted data analysis systems, where the user can converse with software that accurately models the meaning of the data and the questions asked by the user, adds Mansinghka.\n\n“One of the fundamental questions of linguistics is how the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences can be grounded in models of the world, accounting for uncertainty and vagueness in meaning and reference. LLMs, predicting likely token sequences, don’t address this problem. Our paper shows that, in narrow symbolic domains, it is technically possible to map from words to distributions on grounded meanings. It’s a small step towards deeper questions in cognitive science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence needed to understand how machines can communicate about the world like we do,” says O’Donnell.\n\nThis research is funded and supported, in part, by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs Program, the MIT Quest for Intelligence, and Convergent Research."

            "content": "Why it matters: Windows 11's Snipping Tool already allows you to copy text from images, offering functionality similar to Apple's Live Text – but Microsoft's implementation involves a few more steps. A new Windows 11 Insider update aims to streamline the process of grabbing text from various sources for easier copying and pasting.\n\nWindows Insiders in the Canary and Dev channels can now test a feature that moves the Snipping Tool's text extractor directly to the main toolbar. This change eliminates the need to take a screenshot before capturing text.\n\nThe current public version of Windows 11 includes a text extractor in both the Snipping Tool and Photos apps. After opening an image in either program, users can copy text from the picture by clicking the extractor icon – located at the top of the Snipping Tool window or the bottom of the Photos window.\n\nFor further context, Microsoft offered this kind of functionality before in Windows via PowerToys, but that compares unfavorably to Macs or iPhones which have allowed users to select and copy text from photos by simply tapping and dragging since at least 2021.\n\nWindows 11 Insider 11.2503.27.0 adds the extractor icon to the Snipping Tool capture toolbar, which appears after launching the app from the Start Menu or by pressing Win + Shift + S.\n\nAfter clicking the text extractor, users can drag the rectangular snip selector over the portion of the screen containing the desired text.\n\nOnce selected, users can highlight specific text or copy the entire selection to the clipboard. A dropdown menu offers additional options, such as removing line breaks or automatically copying all text within the selected area by clicking \"Copy all text.\" Although preview features don't always make it into public builds, adding this kind of functionality to the Snipping Tool seems like a no-brainer at this point.\n\nUsers interested in testing Windows' upcoming features can register their Microsoft accounts with the Insider Program. To provide feedback on the new update, open the Feedback Hub via the Start Menu or by pressing Win + F, then navigate to Apps > Snipping Tool.\n\nWindows 11 preview versions have also recently introduced new Android phone integrations, launched a gaming optimization FAQ, and attempted to relaunch the controversial Recall feature.\n\nRecall which relies on GenAI and NPUs was meant to be launched last year, but Microsoft was forced to delay it due to security and privacy concerns. Recall allows Copilot to access a timeline of user actions to perform natural language search and commands. However, it works by taking snapshots of nearly everything happening on your PC at any given time. Although Microsoft has taken extra time to added security measures, many users remain skeptical about those assurances."

            "content": "Up until a week ago, it was thought that Elena was going to release at some point in April or May for Street Fighter 6, but turns out that's not the case after all.\n\nWe now know thanks to the teaser trailer that Elena is coming as the last Season 2 DLC character on June 5, which has implications for the Street Fighter scene as a whole.\n\nPresumably, Capcom is also going to release the big Season 3 balance update at the same time as Elena like they did last year for Akuma.\n\nNow that the patch is likely not coming until June as well, that will produce some issues for the competitive scene of SF6 specifically.\n\nPart of the reason many believed Elena would come in April or May was the fact that the Capcom Pro Tour 2025 season is starting up in less than a month.\n\nIt looks like currently, however, the third competitive year is going to begin while still playing the second season of the game.\n\nAnd it's not just for one event either.\n\nThere's Evo Japan 2025 with the second largest Evo bracket ever taking place from May 9–11 and then Combo Breaker 2025 at the end of the month too.\n\nThat's two of the limited offline event Capcom Cup slots up for grabs running on the \"old\" version of the game while the rest of the season will presumably be run on Season 3's updates.\n\nThis shows now there is a pretty clear disconnection between the content aspect of Street Fighter 6 and the competitive scene.\n\nWe did get a taste of this last year when Akuma and the Season 2 update came right before Combo Breaker 2024, and then it happened again with M. Bison's launch and CEO 2024.\n\nThat was a bit different, however, since those majors were not part of the CPT circuit, but now we're seeing it at a bigger level.\n\nThis is all plans from Capcom directly, and it's weird that they'd be apparently out of sync like this.\n\nAs far as we know, a Capcom Pro Tour season (at least since Street Fighter 5) has not begun running on the previous year's version of the game.\n\nWe're not sure of course what's causing this disconnect whether it be an internal delay of Elena and the Season 3 patch or other scheduling conflicts, but there's something going on behind the scenes.\n\nThis desync can even be seen in the content reveals too with Elena's teaser skipping Capcom Cup 11 for some reason and instead dropping on a seemingly random Thursday connected to nothing — and that goes for pretty much all events now outside of Evo.\n\nObviously, the new content is where Street Fighter 6 is going to make pretty much all of the game's money now, but the Capcom Pro Tour also positions itself as the leader of FGC pro circuits.\n\nAnd we're not really seeing any other fighting games have this issue either.\n\nWe've seen before how the development pipeline for SF6 does not appear to be moving as fast as fans expect considering how long it's taken to get Outfit 4 options in the game — and we still haven't seen those yet after almost a year and a half since Outfit 3 dropped.\n\nGames are more expensive and complicated to develop than ever before, but again, it just feels weird that it's taking the team this long to get content out the door compared to Street Fighter 5 and their current competition.\n\nMortal Kombat 1 dropped like six new fighters in the time it took SF6 to get one, and Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves has committed to releasing new characters every two months before the game is even out.\n\nMeanwhile, there's a four-month gap between Mai and Elena.\n\nAnd now that's bled over into the competitive scene as well.\n\nIt just feels like a bit of a disservice now to the competitors who put more time into the game than anyone else.\n\nBut who knows, maybe Capcom has some more unexpected decisions they'll be rolling out.\n\nThere's nothing technically stopping them from dropping the Season 3 balance update before Elena though we have our doubts that would actually come to pass.\n\nInstead, it looks like Street Fighter 6 is going to be starting the next leg of its journey with a disconnect to the dedicated community supporting the game most.\n\nHopefully, the Street Fighter 6 team starts to communicate more about what's going on and what their plans are for the game like they did towards the end of the last entry.\n\nWe're all ears here."

            "content": "We finally made the most meaningful foldable ever. For every bookworm who’s loathed the idea of reading a book on essentially a slab of plastic, Taiwan-based Readmoo has unveiled the MooInk V – the world’s first foldable e-reader. Designed with a game-changing new flexible E Ink screen, the MooInk V gives you the satisfaction of literally opening a book with the way it unfolds. The only thing really missing now is the turning pages bit… and probably the book smell.\n\nThe MooInk V is essentially what would happen if an e-reader and a foldable smartphone had a baby – featuring an 8-inch foldable E Ink Gallery 3 panel that displays in both monochrome and color. As someone who’s constantly toggling between my Kindle and tablet, this particular convergence of technologies hits a sweet spot I didn’t know existed.\n\nDesigner: Readmoo\n\nThe display offers 300 PPI for black and white text (the gold standard for e-readers) and 150 PPI for color content. While that color resolution won’t compete with your iPad, it’s perfectly serviceable for comics, magazines, and textbooks – the kind of content that’s always felt compromised on traditional e-readers.\n\nAnd this foldable format seems honestly perfect for e-books because of how it literally resembles a book. The foldable design creates a natural break that mimics the spine of a book, with a hinge that allows for 180° and 90° folding positions. There’s reportedly a barely noticeable crease where the screen folds, and the device uses an aluminum-magnesium alloy body for durability.\n\nUnder the hood, the MooInk V likely shares similar specifications to Readmoo’s other devices, though exact details haven’t been fully disclosed. It runs on Android, which means you’re not locked into a proprietary ecosystem. Want to use Kindle, Kobo, or other reading apps? Go right ahead. The device should provide days of reading time, given the power efficiency of E Ink displays. It offers Wi-Fi and USB-C connectivity, and while not explicitly confirmed for this model, other Readmoo devices support features like Bluetooth connectivity and stylus input for annotation.\n\nCurrently, the device is available for pre-order in Taiwan for approximately NT$19,800 (around $615), with shipping expected to begin in August. There’s no word yet on international availability, but given the growing interest in E Ink technology beyond simple e-readers, I wouldn’t be surprised to see similar devices making their way to global markets soon.\n\nSHARE Facebook\n\nX\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nTelegram\n\nThreads\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMastodon\n\nBluesky\n\nNextdoor\n\n"

When the user contacted Cursor support, an agent named \"Sam\" told them it was expected behavior under a new policy. But no such policy existed, and Sam was a bot. The AI model made the policy up, sparking a wave of complaints and cancellation threats documented on Hacker News and Reddit.\n\nThis marks the latest instance of AI confabulations (also called \"hallucinations\") causing potential business damage. Confabulations are a type of \"creative gap-filling\" response where AI models invent plausible-sounding but false information. Instead of admitting uncertainty, AI models often prioritize creating plausible, confident responses, even when that means manufacturing information from scratch.\n\nFor companies deploying these systems in customer-facing roles without human oversight, the consequences can be immediate and costly: frustrated customers, damaged trust, and, in Cursor's case, potentially canceled subscriptions.\n\nHow it unfolded\n\nThe incident began when a Reddit user named BrokenToasterOven noticed that while swapping between a desktop, laptop, and a remote dev box, Cursor sessions were unexpectedly terminated.\n\n\"Logging into Cursor on one machine immediately invalidates the session on any other machine,\" BrokenToasterOven wrote in a message that was later deleted by r/cursor moderators. \"This is a significant UX regression.\"\n\nConfused and frustrated, the user wrote an email to Cursor support and quickly received a reply from Sam: \"Cursor is designed to work with one device per subscription as a core security feature,\" read the email reply. The response sounded definitive and official, and the user did not suspect that Sam was not human.\n\nCredit: BrokenToasterOven / Reddit Screenshot of an email from the Cursor support bot named Sam.\n\nAfter the initial Reddit post, users took the post as official confirmation of an actual policy change—one that broke habits essential to many programmers' daily routines. \"Multi-device workflows are table stakes for devs,\" wrote one user.\n\nShortly afterward, several users publicly announced their subscription cancellations on Reddit, citing the non-existent policy as their reason. \"I literally just cancelled my sub,\" wrote the original Reddit poster, adding that their workplace was now \"purging it completely.\" Others joined in: \"Yep, I'm canceling as well, this is asinine.\" Soon after, moderators locked the Reddit thread and removed the original post."

These new color patterns require you to own the base skin and then purchase the new color pattern for 600 Unstable Molecules, a new currency. For Season 2, these can be purchased with Lattice, the paid currency, at a ratio of 1:1, but NetEase did share on social media that starting in Season 3, there will be new ways to obtain this specific currency.\n\nThis means that you will need to spend an additional $6 to unlock each new recolor skin, and that's after purchasing the skin for somewhere between $15-20. To start off, there are four new recolor skins added for four recent and popular skins for Luna Snow, Psylocke, Magik, and Winter Soldier. Once you purchase the color, you can head to the hero customization menu to select it. You retain the old colorway and can swap between them. These colors are also reflected in MVP animations, intro animations, and emotes as well, in addition to changing your appearance in matches.\n\nWhile there are only four to start, NetEase has confirmed plans to add more in the future, and if these sell well, it seems likely NetEase may release them more frequently. At the moment, there is no set cadence for these releases. Marvel Rivals currently adds two new skins to the shop every Friday, so it's possible that these may have a regular release schedule, even if it's not as frequent as once a week."

News of an official Oblivion Remastered has existed since 2023, when the game was revealed in official documents as part of Microsoft's FTC trial regarding its acquisition of Activision Blizzard. More recently, official screenshots of Oblivion Remastered have leaked online, with a release date said to be imminent.\n\nRebelzize, the project lead behind Skyblivion, doesn't seem too worried about there being too much Oblivion to go around in 2025. In a post on X, they said \"the real remake is the friends we made along the way.\" They then clarified their stance.\n\n\"To be clear this changes nothing for me,\" Rebelzize said, in reference to the official Oblivion Remastered also likely releasing this year. \"This always was a passion project and still is until the end. For the community it's a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year. All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster.\"\n\nDespite both the official remaster and the mod both effectively being remakes of Oblivion, their approaches look to be quite different. Skyblivion not only remakes Oblivion in Skyrim's engine while looking to keep Oblivion's original look and gameplay intact, but will also add new content in the form of quests, monsters, and expanded cities. It will also feature new music, a reimagined lockpicking minigame, and an overhaul of the game's UI.\n\nWhile Oblivion Remastered still hasn't been officially announced, details gleaned from the leaks already show some significant changes, such as a more desaturated look and potential changes to the game's combat. Those two things alone will set it apart from Skyblivion.\n\nIf nothing else, players will at least have some choice when it comes to which version of Oblivion to play later this year. Meanwhile, the wait for The Elder Scrolls VI will likely continue to be a very long one."

At CES earlier this year, it announced its 2025 line, and two models stood out.\n\nFirst, there’s the Samsung HW-Q990F, the company’s new flagship 11.1.4-channel soundbar system. It’s quite similar to last year’s HW-Q990D, but the new model has a redesigned (and smaller) subwoofer and boasts advanced AI features that promise improved all-around sound.\n\nSecond, there’s the Samsung HW-QS700F, which is arguably the more exciting of the two. It’s a first-of-a-kind soundbar for Samsung that, thanks to innovative design and unique built-in sensor, works like few other soundbars out there.\n\nSamsung HW-QS700F\n\nThe Samsung HW-QS700F is a 3.12-channel soundbar and wireless subwoofer system. Samsung\n\nNot your average soundbar\n\nAt first glance, the Samsung HW-QS700F looks like most other soundbars, but it’s got a secret: it has an innovative “convertible” design that allows it to adapt its sound to where and how it’s placed.\n\nMost soundbars can be wall-mounted or placed on a tabletop, but the way they are positioned stays the same — the top is still the top, for example. The HW-QS700F does it differently. When placed on a tabletop, the soundbar is positioned horizontally. When wall-mounted, it’s positioned vertically (as shown in the lead image)."

            "content": "WASHINGTON — Even as NASA and its partners on the International Space Station shift to commercial space stations, NASA’s former deputy administrator believes there will still be a role for multilateral coordination of work on those stations.\n\nSpeaking at a Royal Aeronautical Society symposium on international space partnerships here April 16, Pam Melroy, a former astronaut who served as deputy administrator of NASA in the Biden administration, said the experience of the ISS shows the need for coordination among partners on future commercial stations.\n\n“We’re all still watching and thinking,” she said of plans for how commercial stations will operate. “It’s really about trust, and it’s about the relationships. The great thing is that we have these deep relationships with our partners and we’re beginning to grow them with other, new partners.”\n\nThe experience of the ISS, she said, showed the value of “certain very-high-level boards” in ISS operations, such as one multilateral board, primarily of doctors, who provide medical approval for crews going to the station. Other multilateral boards make key decisions on station architecture, she added.\n\n“I do think that something like that is going to be needed, ultimately,” she concluded.\n\nAnother issue she raised was the need for “harmonization” of space law among various international participants in commercial space stations, which will be outside the current intergovernmental agreement that governs activities on the ISS.\n\n“There’s some work to be done. There’s going to have to be harmonization of space law because now you’ve got a commercial entity,” she said. “What does it mean to have one country fly commercially to another country’s space station? We’re going to have to figure out how to get through that.”\n\nBoth companies developing commercial space stations and current ISS partners such as Canada, Europe and Japan have been trying to determine the best way to work together after the end of the ISS. Some countries have expressed concerns about paying American companies for access to their stations, preferring to spend their money domestically, as they are able to do through the ISS partnership by exchanging services.\n\nSome companies, in response, have been working to establish agreements with companies and governments to give them greater roles in their stations. Starlab Space, for example, is working with Europe’s Airbus Defence and Space, Japan’s Mitsubishi and Canada’s MDA Space on its proposed space station.\n\nThere are other lessons to take from the ISS, including how to access it. “Because the systems grew up organically, there six or seven or eight different ways to get an experiment to the space station,” she noted, making it confusing for people wanting to fly payloads. “The next step is to try and shrink that down a little bit.”\n\nThat could be done, she suggested, through a single “microgravity institute” organization, which would coordinate payloads from U.S. government agencies and perhaps international partners. That institute could also pool medical data from people flying to the station, as is done on the ISS today, while preserving medical privacy.\n\nMelroy expressed confidence that some solutions will be developed to those issues during the transition from the ISS to commercial space stations. “The signals are very clear that the partners want to stay together in low Earth orbit.”"

            "description": "The Huawei Mate XT is the first trifold phone anyone can actually buy — here’s what it looks like from every angle.",
            "content": "is a news editor with over a decade’s experience in journalism. He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nAfter 24 hours with Huawei’s Mate XT — a.k.a. the world’s first trifold smartphone — I have this to say for it: the novelty hasn’t worn off.\n\nI’ve tried the Mate XT twice before, first shortly after it launched last September, and then again in February after it was released outside of China. But now Huawei is ready to actually let me review its one-of-a-kind hardware, which at today’s exchange rates would set you back just under $4,000.\n\nI’ll be spending the next week with my SIM card in the Mate XT, as I get used to life with triple the usual space and none of the usual Google Mobile Services support, but one day in, I figured I’d share my first — or is it third? — impressions and a bunch of pictures.\n\nThere are really three ways to use the XT: as a regular-ish phone with a 6.4-inch display, in a square shape that resembles other foldables and measures 7.9 inches, or fully opened into what’s essentially a 10.2-inch tablet.\n\nIt feels a little unnatural to open at first. Since each segment folds in a different direction, it took me a few hours to get used to where I push and where I pull, and I spent most of that adjustment period worrying I was about to snap something. Once you have it figured out though, the process is pretty satisfying, even if opening the phone is absolutely a two-handed job.\n\nThe three segments attach magnetically when closed, and they at least feel sturdy, even if I wouldn’t trust this thing to survive being sat on. You’ll also have to live with part of the display being permanently exposed on the phone’s right edge, and the front screen doubling as the phone’s back when it’s halfway open. Scratches — and fingerprint smudges — are an inevitability.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it’s thicker than your average phone, and heavier, but it’s more comfortable than you’d think. It’s also thinner and lighter than your average 10-inch tablet, so it’s all a matter of perspective.\n\nIt’s hard to tell from looking, but Huawei has tapered the body: at its thinnest it’s actually slimmer than even Oppo’s Find N5, but the third of the phone with a USB-C port is a hair thicker.\n\nLet’s get the software question out of the way: no, this doesn’t have any official support for Google Mobile Services, which means no Play Store and no Google apps — at least not out of the box. Sideloading all things Google is easier than ever, which is to say it takes an hour and is a bit of a headache, but if you can get through that then you’ve essentially got a regular Android experience.\n\nWith the help of open source tools like Aurora Store and microG, I got every Android and Google app I tried up and running, with the sole (and understandable) exception of Google Wallet. I’ll miss NFC payments, but everything else works.\n\nWill they work forever? I don’t know. Will they update properly? I also have no idea. Does sideloading every single app introduce a whole new set of exciting security vulnerabilities into my life? Almost certainly!\n\nI also don’t know how long even Huawei will let this sort of setup work. My Mate XT is running on HarmonyOS 4.2, which still has a little Android at its heart. But the company is slowly moving towards HarmonyOS Next, which isn’t compatible with Android apps at all, so the Mate XT’s next iteration — or simply its next software update — might kill off Android support for good.\n\nThese are mostly the default apps the Mate XT ships with… …and this is everything I was able to sideload.\n\nJust like on an Android tablet, some apps make better use of the full display than others. It’s just about the perfect size for streaming, but Instagram has no idea what to do with all the extra space.\n\nMultitasking is a bit basic, too. Three screens should mean three apps, right? Wrong. The split-screen mode only supports two at a time, and if you want a third, it’ll have to be an awkward “Floating Window” getting in the way of something else.\n\n24 hours in, I can confirm that the Mate XT feels like an engineering marvel. Whether it’s a phone anyone should drop four grand on is what I’ll spend the next week figuring out."

The studio also recently reduced the price of Everspace 2's first expansion, Titans, from $15 to $12.\n\nRockfish Games clarified that even though the price for Wrath of the Ancients has been lowered, no content has been cut from it. It contains new stories, side quests, enemies, and a new playable Wraith ship.\n\n\"As an independent studio, we are lucky to be in a position to be able to do this based on the support of an amazing community,\" Rockfish Games said in a Steam blog post. \"If you were genuinely looking forward to giving us that little bit extra, thank you! We will have a new artbook and soundtrack gathering together content from our DLCs available when Wrath of the Ancients launches that you can put that money towards instead.\"\n\nThe studio didn't specify \"events happening in the world,\" but acknowledged the rising costs of everything and feelings of uncertainty. PS5 console and PS Plus prices have increased, and certain games like Mario Kart World are now $80. It's also possible that Rockfish Games is referring to the Trump tariffs that are impacting the video game industry.\n\nEverspace 2 is an open-world space shooter that follows Adam, a clone pilot who aims to escape the Demilitarized Zone of Cluster 34. It features a robust single-player campaign, plenty of side missions, loot, and additional challenges to partake it in. Everspace 2 is available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S."

He co-hosts The Besties, is a board member of the Frida Cinema, and created NYU’s first games journalism course.\n\nOne of the gnarliest games ever published by a AAA studio is available at a steep discount on Steam. That’s great news… if you can get past the game-breaking bugs.\n\nWhen Activision published Prototype 2 in 2012, the big-budget video game scene was stuck in a creative rut. You could have whatever you wanted, so long as it starred a bald dude with an unquenchable thirst for violence. Hitman. Spec Ops. Max Payne. The cover of Call of Duty was just a silhouette of a bald guy with a gun. Even Mass Effect 2 (beloved, I know!) fell uncomfortably into the same bucket.\n\nPrototype 2 is special in that, with hindsight, it’s unclear if the game is the furthest this trend would go or a knowing parody. My guess? Both.\n\nImage: Radical Entertainment/Activision\n\nYou play as former U.S. Marine Sergeant James Heller, and your overarching goal is to kill the protagonist of the original Prototype. Thanks to mutant powers, you can run up skyscrapers, leap entire city blocks, and glide through avenues — imagine the traversal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 with a city dipped in Vaseline.\n\nUnlike Spider-Man, Heller also has a bundle of ultra-violent supervillain talents. You can eat people in a single bite and then transform into them. His forearms morph into mutated claws that would humble Wolverine. Even a simple punch has enough power to juice a civilian; every enemy contains enough blood to fill a swimming pool.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is a product of its time in the most literal sense: the PC port, released a few months after the console version, is a disaster. You wouldn’t know it from most reviews at the time, because just getting a console game on PC felt like a gift. Publishers were still terrified of piracy and rarely invested in the platform. It’s a far cry from today, when PC is rapidly cutting into markets and publishers like Square Enix are rethinking their entire business models around it.\n\nImage: Radical Entertainment/Activision\n\nNow combine that 2012 problem with a 2025 one: the industry’s general indifference (if not outright disdain) toward video game preservation, especially for series that no longer promise big profits. The result is Prototype 2 on Steam — a good game failed by the industry twice, still sold despite many players struggling to even get it to launch, relying on YouTube guides and old forum threads.\n\nI recommend you play Prototype 2! But you might want to dig your Xbox 360 out of storage and find a disc. Remember those things? They were great."

We've known Penguin was in the game since its reveal last week, but today's Direct decided to feature this blue cutie in a very meme-specific way...by repeatedly throwing him off cliffs.\n\nThis happened not once, but twice during the Direct, as fans have pointed out on social media. On one occasion, Penguin simply misjudges a curve and sails neatly off over an icy landscape:\n\nBut in a second, even more on the nose move, a Penguin in Free Roam drives straight off a cliff into the sea below while music from Super Mario 64 toodles away in the background:\n\n29 years later and we still chucking penguins off of cliffs like in Mario 64#MarioKartWorld pic.twitter.com/7klPg5rZkM — 🔥FireShadow64🔥(DROP THE PRICE) (@FireShadow64) April 17, 2025\n\nIf you're confused as to why this is noteworthy, allow me to draw your attention to a long-standing community meme of Penguin from Super Mario 64. In Super Mario 64, players discovered years ago that it was possible to collect a Power Star from Mother Penguin by returning Baby Penguin to her, then to take Baby Penguin after the star appears and take them away again...or even drop them off a cliff:\n\nThis bit has been memed into fame for over a decade by the Mario community, so it's extremely funny to see Nintendo acknowledge it even if it's in a somewhat subtle, plausible-deniability kind of way. Is this a horrendous thing to do? Society still hasn't come down cleanly on one side or another of the Penguin-cliff debate. At least Mario Kart World gives Penguin a nice little water vehicle so they can just keep going once they've landed.\n\nToday's Mario Kart Nintendo Direct wasn't exactly the font of new information many were hoping it would be, but we still got word on some interesting new stuff: more new characters, courses, items, and features, as well as a close look (courtesy of Penguin and others) of the new open world Free Roam mode, which will let players drive around anywhere in the world without restraint.\n\nYou can catch up on everything announced right here.\n\nRebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Points are earned through winning games to help you climb through different skill tiers and divisions, and losing games will deduct points in the higher leagues.\n\nTo start out, losing games in Rookie and Novice will not cost you any points. Once you reach Contender and higher, though, you will lose rank points and can drop back to Novice if you lose too much. At Contender and Elite, you will lose “a small amount of points” per loss, but at Pro and higher, “all wins and losses are worth close to the same amount” of rank points.\n\nBlizzard says that, “due to the evolving nature of Stadium—with new heroes, maps, modes, and abilities changing the meta every season—your rank will reset” each season.

A dedicated jump button, more responsive attacks, snappier dodging, and improved lock-on all contribute to this.\n\nElsewhere, all weapon types have had an audio overhaul to make hits more satisfying; the character creator has improved options; and the game's user interface has been upgraded to make it cleaner and easier to navigate.\n\nOn top of all that, the tutorial has been revised, and there are new quality-of-life options like automatic vigor collection and visual button prompts for certain actions.\n\nThere's plenty of footage in the above video to back all this up, and it looks like a big upgrade to us. If you've played Lords of the Fallen in the past, it might be worth installing this update to see all the enhancements.\n\nAre you still enjoying Lords of the Fallen? What do you think of this update? Tell us in the comments section below."

            "content": "Over the years, Google marketing has compared the Pixel to the iPhone. There was notably the Phone X vs. Pixel 3a Night Sight campaign in 2019. The latest example — Pixel 9a vs. iPhone 16e — makes for the most explicit comparison to date.\n\nAvailable as a post on the Google Store, the comparison starts with a specs chart, with Google vaguely trying to be objective: “Obviously, we’re big Pixel fans. So let’s step away from the subjective stuff – like how the Pixel 9a color choices are way more fun and the design is cooler – and look at the facts.”\n\nOn the hardware front, Google is highlighting the bigger/brighter display, larger battery, and dual versus single camera system. It goes on to argue that the “more important differences occur during editing.” Google is referring to Add Me (using AR to merge photos), Best Take (composite shot of the best facial expressions), and Magic Editor (drag-and-drop editing + adding generative AI elements).\n\nOn the AI front, it’s how Gemini has deep integration with first-party Google apps. Google points out how Siri “does not support natural language conversations” compared to Gemini Live.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nOutside of Gemini, it’s Circle to Search and the Call Assist suite of Phone features (Call Screen, Hold for Me, and more). Google notes how “Gemini supports 45 languages, including all countries where Pixel 9a is sold” versus Apple Intelligence’s nine.\n\nThe final software comparison is seven years of updates versus how “Apple only guarantees five years of updates,” though it can be more.\n\nGoogle ends on price and how the Pixel 9a starts at $499 for 128GB versus the iPhone 16e’s $599.\n\nWith the iPhone 16e, Apple introduced a budget model into its annual lineup. Google has been doing that for much longer, with these Pixel-iPhone comparisons likely becoming a yearly occurrence going forward."

The company has already launched three Vega-powered devices: The company’s Echo Show 5 and Echo Hub smart displays both run Vega, as does the Echo Spot smart clock / speaker.\n\nAmazon has been slower in adopting Vega for its smart TVs and streaming players. The company originally planned to launch a Vega-powered streaming stick in late 2024, but ultimately delayed that launch.

Some new tools are also included, such as Google’s new Veo 2 text-to-video AI model, and Whisk, which allows users to “mix text and image prompts to create something new.”\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic have announced their own education initiatives this month, similarly hoping to attract students with a free taste of their AI tools.

Users expecting the update globally may have to wait a while longer (still) as Vats states the build was spotted in South Korea. However, what users should look out for is build vS928NKSU4BYD9 for the Galaxy S24 series whenever it hits your device.\n\nInterestingly, the provided screenshot details the updated One UI 7 build is ~292MB. It's likely the smaller size will impact those who received the massive upgrade before Samsung's pause. The update originally launched with a 5GB download, so this might jump slightly for those who never got it to begin with.\n\nOf course, it's worth keeping your eyes peeled as we finish the week. With One UI 7's resuming in South Korea, it's likely global regions will see it in mid-April next week.\n\nTroublesome Times\n\nBreaking ‼️ Galaxy S24 series One UI 7 rollout resumed with a new build in KoreaBuild Version: S928NKSU4BYD9/S928NOKR4BYD9/S928NKSU4BYD9Rollout will expand to other regions soon. pic.twitter.com/5eeBtN3eCIApril 17, 2025\n\nOne UI 7's rollout started on time on April 10 for users in the U.S. and Europe for the Galaxy S24 series. Alongside the past-gen slab phone, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 were included, similar to how Samsung worked its rollout in Korea. However, Galaxy user excitement dwindled severely once the Korean OEM paused the update following a \"serious bug.\"\n\nSamsung pulled the patch four days later on April 14 after it identified a critical issue with its software. A tipster reported that the bug gave some Galaxy S24 users problems with unlocking their devices. Samsung not only suspended its rollout in the U.S. and Europe, but also in China and Vietnam, to name a couple more.\n\nSamsung then informed Android Central it's been forced to update its One UI 7 rollout schedule to better reflect the times.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nSpeaking of, one person on Reddit seems to have discovered what this new schedule could be, following a supposed Samsung Members app notification. The alert reportedly states One UI 7 should be available for the Galaxy S24, Flip 6, and Fold 6 in April. A few other older devices could begin seeing it in May."

Just like with all the others (Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Portal with RTX), the feature is a PC exclusive.\n\nOn the subject, the developer said:\n\nExpanding on Ray Tracing technology and available as a new “Ultra Max” option in the graphics settings, light now follows every bounced path, including that from indirect lighting and multiple reflections. Shade, light, and colours dynamically shift as they would in real-life, whether you’re racing under the thousands of lights in Bahrain or navigating the castle section on Baku at sunset.\n\nIf you have a PC capable of experiencing it, Path Tracing is the most realistic simulation of light on track that we’ve ever delivered.\n\nThese aren't the only visual and technical improvements that fans will find in F1 25. Tonemapping and light balance improvements promise a more dramatic effect in all types of weather, with better representation of changes in cloud cover. There are also some enhancements to the track surface shader, which now displays more pronounced tyre and lock-up marks as well as physical changes based on other collected real-world data.\n\nThe addition of light detection and ranging scanning (LIDAR) makes tracks far more accurate overall. LIDAR also helped trees and foliage better match the species, placement, size, and shape of their real-life counterparts, with new additions such as cherry blossom trees in Suzuka.\n\nCodemasters also introduced NVIDIA Audio2Face. This technology (already seen in STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl) improved the facial animations that players will see during modes such as Career and Braking Point. The reintroduced press interviews now capture drivers delivering their responses in a more authentic fashion, with this technology extending to facility heads in My Team. Lastly, PS5 Pro console users will enjoy split-screen racing at 60 frames per second in this year's edition of the official F1 racing game.\n\nCodemasters hasn't shared the system requirements for path tracing usage on PC, but we'll let you know once it does. F1 25 will be available on May 30 across PC and consoles."

            "content": "The big picture: If you've ever wanted to bring a bit of Severance's office dystopia into your real life – minus the mind-splitting surgery – custom keyboard brand Atomic has you covered. The company just announced the MDR Dasher, a real-world replica of the retro-futuristic keyboard featured on the Apple TV+ series.\n\nIn Severance, the keyboards used by Macrodata Refinement – the department where the protagonists work – appear to draw inspiration from Data General's vintage Dasher terminals, popular in the late '70s and early '80s. Hence, the name MDR Dasher. The original machines were known for their sturdy build, chunky layout, and utilitarian elegance – qualities the show embraced in its retro-futuristic aesthetic.\n\nThe Dasher fully commits to the show's design. It preserves the layout and aesthetics while deliberately omitting keys like escape, control, and option. That absence serves as a cheeky tribute to Lumon Industries and its founder, Kier Egan, and reinforces the show's authoritarian undertones. The keyboard includes 73 keys and follows the same 70-percent compact layout used in the series.\n\nThe keyboard features a raised profile, thick borders, and a palette of muted blues with a dirty white frame, giving it an industrial vibe. Lighter blue keycaps dominate the center, while darker hues fill in the rest. That \"rest\" is substantial, thanks to the oversized deck, which leaves ample space for the arrow keys, arranged in a cross formation and set apart from the primary cluster. Off to the far right sits a trackball – just like in the show – replacing a traditional mouse and adding to its vintage charm.\n\nUnlike its on-screen counterpart, this version connects via USB-C and is compatible with modern operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The case is crafted from durable aluminum, offering a premium feel and added sturdiness for long-term use. Its sturdy construction adds to its industrial aesthetic and retro charm that made the original design iconic.\n\nAtomic Keyboard has yet to reveal a final price. The company floated a $399 figure, but it's still unconfirmed, likely due to ongoing tariff issues. For now, sign-ups are open for the limited-run pre-launch list. Once you secure your keyboard, complete the transformation into an MDR worker bee by visiting the Lumon Industries website and refining microdata to your heart's content. Praise Kier."

            "description": "Dragons, Monks, and an angelic planeswalker are among Standard's hottest cards from Tarkir: Dragonstorm.",
            "content": "Hello, and welcome back to Metagame Mentor, your weekly guide to the top decks and latest Constructed developments on the path to the Pro Tour. Magic's newest set, Tarkir: Dragonstorm, has made its mark on Standard, introducing new archetypes and shaking up the metagame.\n\nIn this article, I'll dive into the earliest Standard results featuring Tarkir: Dragonstorm, highlighting the most important additions from the set. The first week of this new Standard format has only scratched the surface, but if the early innovations are any indication, the upcoming series of Regional Championships promise to be a thrilling ride.\n\nThe Standard Metagame with Tarkir: Dragonstorm\n\nStandard, the rotating 60-card format, currently spans expansion sets from Dominaria United onward. To capture an early snapshot of the metagame, I analyzed 192 published decklists from Magic Online Challenges held from April 9–12, along with Top 8 lists from the Standard RCQ at SCG CON Denver. While the sample size of 200 decklists is modest, it offers a valuable glimpse at what the set promises.\n\nTo show which decks are dominating the top tables, I assigned points to each deck based on its rectified number of net wins—calculated as the number of match wins minus losses, with negative values adjusted to zero. By combining these points across all events, each archetype's share of the total rectified net wins blends popularity and performance into a single, comprehensive metric: the winner's metagame share.\n\nIn this table, each archetype name hyperlinks to a top-performing decklist that closely reflects its aggregate build. The \"Other\" category collects decks with less than one percent metagame share, including inventive brews like Five-Color Legends, Dimir Demons, Mardu Pixie, Gruul Leyline, Mono-White Tokens, and Boros Prowess.\n\nThe most-played non-land cards across all main decks were Monstrous Rage , Stormchaser's Talent , Burst Lightning , Nowhere to Run , and Heartfire Hero . Their prevalence underscores that Standard is driven by efficient one-mana creatures and interactive spells, particularly in aggressive red decks. In today's metagame, falling behind is not an option.\n\nCompared to my previous metagame snapshot before the release of Tarkir: Dragonstorm, there's been a clear shift. Izzet Prowess has rocketed into a top-tier contender, seemingly out of nowhere. With Cori-Steel Cutter at its core, the archetype now rivals Mono-Red Aggro in both popularity and potency. Meanwhile, Domain Overlords—the deck that triumphed at Pro Tour Aetherdrift—has seen a sharp decline. As a result, Up the Beanstalk has largely vanished from the spotlight.\n\nThe Most-Played Cards from Tarkir: Dragonstorm\n\nTarkir: Dragonstorm has injected a wealth of powerful new cards into Standard, breathing new life into both established and emerging archetypes. The table below highlights the 20 most played new-to-Standard cards across the decklists I analyzed.\n\nCard Name Total Copies Main Deck Sideboard 1. Sunpearl Kirin 149 149 0 2.

Voice of Victory 5 0 5\n\nSunpearl Kirin claims the title of the most played card in Standard from Tarkir: Dragonstorm. Functionally, it's a two-mana Nurturing Pixie with flash, which has reinforced the consistency of self-bounce strategies. From Esper Pixie to Orzhov Pixie and even Mardu Pixie, the Kirin has proved itself as a strong role-player.\n\nBut in terms of raw power and multi-format potential, the standout star is arguably Cori-Steel Cutter . It's a formidable token-generating engine that, as an artifact, is more to remove than a creature. In the right shell, Cori-Steel Cutter is easy to trigger turn after turn, snowballing into a relentless swarm of Monks. While its main home is in Izzet Prowess, a wide range of decks have embraced it, including Boros Pia, Grixis Bounce, and Mardu Pixie. Even a handful of Mono-Red Aggro and Gruul Mice decks have already incorporated Cori-Steel Cutter .\n\nTo better understand how these new cards are shaping the metagame, let's take a closer look at the archetypes that have gained the most from Tarkir: Dragonstorm's standout additions.\n\nCori-Steel Cutter Supercharges Izzet Prowess\n\n693583\n\n1 Bounce Off 4 Burst Lightning 4 Cori-Steel Cutter 5 Island 4 Monastery Swiftspear 4 Monstrous Rage 4 Mountain 4 Opt 4 Riverpyre Verge 4 Shivan Reef 4 Sleight of Hand 4 Slickshot Show-Off 2 Spell Pierce 4 Spirebluff Canal 4 Stock Up 4 Stormchaser's Talent 2 Disdainful Stroke 3 Ghost Vacuum 2 Sunspine Lynx 3 Third Path Iconoclast 4 Torch the Tower 1 Witchstalker Frenzy\n\nAt first glance, it might seem odd to run an aggressive red deck in Standard without the ubiquitous Mice package. But Cori-Steel Cutter has changed the equation, catapulting Izzet Prowess into the same tier as Mono-Red Aggro, if not beyond it.\n\nThe deck is as elegant as it is deadly. On turn three, cast Cori-Steel Cutter and a cheap spell like Opt to generate a Monk token, equip it with Cori-Steel Cutter , and swing for two. From there, the deck uses a suite of one-mana spells, card-draw effects, and a plotted Slickshot Show-Off , it becomes trivial to trigger flurry on successive turns. Each pair of spells you cast fuels a growing army of Monk tokens, while prowess amplifies their threat level turn by turn.\n\nOne of the few cards that can cleanly answer this explosive strategy is Temporary Lockdown , but even that's not a guaranteed solution thanks to main-deck copies of Spell Pierce . With this powerful configuration, Darthkid piloted Izzet Prowess to a 4th-place finish in a recent Magic Online Challenge, and many other players have found similar success with this hot new archetype.\n\nSunpearl Kirin Brings Bounce at Instant Speed\n\nSunpearl Kirin\n\n2 Adarkar Wastes 3 Caves of Koilos 4 Concealed Courtyard 4 Darkslick Shores 2 Entity Tracker 2 Fear of Isolation 1 Go for the Throat 4 Hopeless Nightmare 1 Momentum Breaker 4 Nowhere to Run 4 Nurturing Pixie 4 Optimistic Scavenger 2 Restless Anchorage 4 Seachrome Coast 3 Spiteful Hexmage 4 Stormchaser's Talent 4 Sunpearl Kirin 1 Swamp 4 This Town Ain't Big Enough 3 Underground River 1 Defiled Crypt // Cadaver Lab 2 Destroy Evil 2 Grim Bauble 1 Loran of the Third Path 2 No More Lies 3 Rest in Peace 2 Stock Up 2 The Witch's Vanity\n\nSunpearl Kirin has been adopted by Esper Pixie. While its stats are slightly weaker than Fear of Isolation , flash adds a new layer of flexibility. You can now hold up two mana, assess your opponent's play, and then respond with the best option—whether that's Nowhere to Run , This Town Ain't Big Enough , or another Kirin.\n\nEsper Pixie was already leaning heavily on a suite of self-bounce effects, and Sunpearl Kirin slots seamlessly into that framework. To make space, most lists have trimmed copies of Kaito, Bane of Nightmares and/or Stock Up . The self-bounce configuration of 4 This Town Ain't Big Enough , 4 Sunpearl Kirin , 4 Nurturing Pixie , and 2 Fear of Isolation has become the new norm. With that setup, HouseOfManaMTG took down a recent Standard Challenge on Magic Online.\n\nThe inclusion of the Kirin has also rippled through the rest of the deck. Entity Tracker has joined as a complementary flash threat, while Sunpearl Kirin 's synergy with Spiteful Hexmage —drawing a card when you bounce the Cursed Role—has prompted a resurgence of the black one-drop. The result is a leaner, more aggressive version of Esper Pixie, which remains a formidable force in the Standard format.\n\nTersa Lightshatter Ignites Mono-Red Aggro\n\n693607\n\n4 Burst Lightning 4 Emberheart Challenger 4 Heartfire Hero 4 Hired Claw 4 Lightning Strike 4 Manifold Mouse 4 Monstrous Rage 16 Mountain 4 Rockface Village 4 Screaming Nemesis 3 Soulstone Sanctuary 4 Tersa Lightshatter 1 Witchstalker Frenzy 2 Case of the Crimson Pulse 2 Lithomantic Barrage 4 Sunspine Lynx 4 Torch the Tower 3 Witchstalker Frenzy\n\nMuch like Screaming Nemesis , Tersa Lightshatter delivers three explosive points of hasty damage while offering the potential for lasting value. Early on, it helps filter your draws, letting you sculpt your hand to find the right mix of threats, lands, or instants. And later, when you hit the graveyard threshold, Tersa grants access to free cards—perhaps a game-ending Monstrous Rage .\n\nMany of the top-performing Mono-Red Aggro decks—including Latorretta's winning list from a recent Magic Online Challenge—have adopted multiple copies of Tersa, trimming Monastery Swiftspear to make room. Compared to pre-Tarkir: Dragonstorm builds, this version embraces a slightly higher curve and runs 23 lands, underlining a shift toward mid-game staying power.\n\nPersonally, I like the direction, but I believe there's still room for tuning. I'd consider shaving a copy each of Lightning Strike and Tersa Lightshatter in favor of Monastery Swiftspear and Sunspine Lynx . With a bit more optimization, we can get closer to perfection.\n\nDesperate Measures Adds Fuel for Leyline of Resonance\n\nDesperate Measures\n\n4 Blackcleave Cliffs 1 Blazemire Verge 4 Cacophony Scamp 4 Callous Sell-Sword 4 Desperate Measures 4 Emberheart Challenger 4 Heartfire Hero 4 Leyline of Resonance 4 Manifold Mouse 4 Might of the Meek 4 Monstrous Rage 11 Mountain 4 Sulfurous Springs 4 Turn Inside Out 4 Duress 4 Leyline of the Void 2 Pyroclasm 2 Sunspine Lynx 3 Torch the Tower\n\nAlthough Skullclamp is banned in several Constructed formats, Desperate Measures brings a similar effect to Standard. Of course, it's a one-shot effect rather than a repeatable engine. But what if you could use it twice?\n\nPaired with Leyline of Resonance , Desperate Measures starts to look more like its Equipment counterpart. Casting it in response to a removal spell lets you draw four cards for just one mana—an absurd exchange. And that's not the only trick. Want to push damage? Target your own Emberheart Challenger twice, then swing in with a 5/1 creature. Looking for value? Target your own Cacophony Scamp to draw cards and remove a creature.\n\nThese powerful interactions helped Bunnyfat clinch a victory at a recent Magic Online Challenge. Thanks to Tarkir: Dragonstorm, Leyline of Resonance strategies are not only viable again, but they're downright dangerous.\n\nHarmonize Shines in Jeskai Oculus\n\n693547\n\n4 Abhorrent Oculus 2 Adarkar Wastes 2 Battlefield Forge 1 Bitter Reunion 4 Fear of Missing Out 2 Glacial Dragonhunt 4 Helping Hand 4 Inspiring Vantage 4 Proft's Eidetic Memory 2 Recommission 4 Seachrome Coast 4 Shivan Reef 4 Spirebluff Canal 4 Spyglass Siren 4 Steamcore Scholar 2 Tersa Lightshatter 2 Thundering Falls 4 Torch the Tower 3 Winternight Stories 2 Chandra, Spark Hunter 3 Destroy Evil 2 Ghost Vacuum 1 Lithomantic Barrage 1 Negate 2 Pyroclasm 2 Spell Pierce 2 The Filigree Sylex\n\nTarkir: Dragonstorm introduces the harmonize mechanic, which lets you cast cards from your graveyard. It's a natural fit for decks already using draw-and-discard effects, such as Jeskai Oculus. Discarding a harmonize card early isn't a loss—it's an investment into the future. When those spells also help you loot, the synergy potential in Jeskai Oculus grows even larger.\n\nRubyXillia's version of Jeskai Oculus runs both Glacial Dragonhunt and Winternight Stories , which serve multiple roles. Not only can they be pitched to Fear of Missing Out or Steamcore Scholar , but they also power up Proft's Eidetic Memory and fill the graveyard for Helping Hand , Recommission , and Abhorrent Oculus . To make room for this new recursive graveyard potential, Inti, Seneschal of the Sun has gotten cut, but the resulting list is more consistent and explosive.\n\nNew Dragons Help Jeskai Decks Take Control\n\n693703\n\n1 Abrade 3 Beza, the Bounding Spring 1 Cori Mountain Monastery 1 Day of Judgment 2 Dispelling Exhale 3 Elegant Parlor 4 Floodfarm Verge 4 Get Lost 2 Island 4 Lightning Helix 3 Marang River Regent 3 Meticulous Archive 1 Mountain 3 Plains 1 Ride's End 3 Riverpyre Verge 4 Shiko, Paragon of the Way 1 Split Up 4 Stock Up 3 Sunbillow Verge 3 Temporary Lockdown 3 Three Steps Ahead 3 Thundering Falls 2 Authority of the Consuls 1 Beza, the Bounding Spring 1 Day of Judgment 1 Ghost Vacuum 2 Jace, the Perfected Mind 2 Kutzil's Flanker 2 Negate 2 Tishana's Tidebinder 2 Wilt-Leaf Liege\n\nControl decks aim to dictate the flow of the game by answering early threats and eventually pulling ahead with raw card advantage or late-game power. Two new Dragons from Tarkir: Dragonstorm offer exactly that, bolstering Jeskai Control as an archetype.\n\nLeading the charge is Shiko, Paragon of the Way , who provides value and flexibility. You can cast Stock Up for resources, Split Up to clear the board, or Get Lost to maintain control.\n\nMarang River Regent comes with an Omen spell, letting you keep mana up for either countermagic or card draw on your opponent's turn. And when you play it as a six-mana Dragon, it helps stabilize the board and go for the win.\n\nGerardo94 showcased the strength of this new core with a 3rd-place finish in a recent Magic Online Challenge. Their list also featured Dispelling Exhale , which functions like a supercharged No More Lies with a less demanding mana cost. Together, these additions provide a compelling new direction for control decks.\n\nElspeth Reinforces Token-Based Strategies\n\n693491\n\n2 Anoint with Affliction 3 Beza, the Bounding Spring 4 Bleachbone Verge 4 Caretaker's Talent 4 Carrot Cake 4 Concealed Courtyard 4 Cut Down 2 Day of Judgment 2 Demolition Field 2 Elspeth, Storm Slayer 1 Elspeth's Smite 4 Enduring Innocence 4 Fountainport 2 Get Lost 2 Go for the Throat 1 Kaya, Intangible Slayer 2 Overlord of the Mistmoors 5 Plains 4 Shadowy Backstreet 2 Sunfall 2 Swamp 2 Destroy Evil 3 Duress 1 Elspeth's Smite 1 Ghost Vacuum 2 Outrageous Robbery 1 Pest Control 2 The Stone Brain 3 Wilt-Leaf Liege\n\nIn a deck already built to flood the board with tokens, Elspeth, Storm Slayer is an Anointed Procession with loyalty abilities that offer even more versatility. In this version of Orzhov Tokens, piloted by Ivan_Draw_Go to a 5th-place finish in a recent Standard Challenge, Elspeth doubles down on what the deck does best.\n\nShe enhances a wide variety of token sources: Rabbit tokens from Carrot Cake , Treasure and Fish from Beza, the Bounding Spring and Fountainport , Insects from Overlord of the Mistmoors , and even her own Soldiers. With so many different token sources already bolstered by Caretaker's Talent , Elspeth's doubling effect compounds quickly.\n\nPlayers are debating whether to splash black for Cut Down or to remain mono-white for Lay Down Arms , but those are minor questions. What's clear is that Elspeth, Storm Slayer elevates this archetype to new heights, providing a dominant win condition that fits seamlessly into the existing game plan.\n\nJeskai Revelation Simplifies the Omniscience Win\n\n693676\n\n4 Abuelo's Awakening 4 Adarkar Wastes 2 Blast Zone 2 Chart a Course 3 Confounding Riddle 3 Ephara's Dispersal 1 Fabled Passage 4 Fallaji Archaeologist 4 Floodfarm Verge 3 Invasion of Arcavios 4 Island 4 Meticulous Archive 4 Moment of Truth 4 Omniscience 1 Oracle of Tragedy 2 Plains 3 Seachrome Coast 4 Stock Up 4 Temporary Lockdown 1 Beza, the Bounding Spring 1 Day of Judgment 2 Disenchant 2 Get Lost 2 Grand Abolisher 1 Jeskai Revelation 2 Negate 3 Riptide Gearhulk 1 Spell Pierce\n\nThe last new standout card worth spotlighting, Jeskai Revelation , looks like a sideboard card, but it plays a surprisingly central role in Azorius Omniscience . Its key function is to streamline the deck's win condition. After reanimating Omniscience with Abuelo's Awakening , the deck can cast Invasion of Arcavios , grab Jeskai Revelation from the sideboard, and begin a loop. Bounce Invasion, deal 4 damage to the opponent, recast Invasion, and repeat.\n\nIn previous iterations, the combo finish relied on a clunky sequence with Johann's Stopgap , This Town Ain't Big Enough , and Haunt the Network . Now, Jeskai Revelation offers a one-card kill loop, the win is cleaner and the sideboard has opened up. Freed from needing multiple pieces, the sideboard now has room for more utility cards like additional copies of Disenchant .\n\nWhat's Next for Standard?\n\nThe arrival of Cori-Steel Cutter and other game-changing cards from Tarkir: Dragonstorm has shaken up the Standard format. But we're still only scratching the surface. The coming weeks promise a thrilling period of discovery, as new archetypes emerge and top-tier strategies are refined across high-stakes competition.\n\nHere's the schedule for the upcoming Regional Championship cycle:\n\nIf you're eager to witness high-level Standard play in action, don't miss the Ultimate Guard European Magic Series Regional Championship in Bologna, Italy, on April 25–26!\n\nFanfinity will provide live video coverage on both Twitch and YouTube, featuring high production value, awesome features, and insightful commentary from seasoned champions.

            "content": "Quantum gravity is one of the biggest unresolved and challenging problems in physics, as it seeks to reconcile quantum mechanics, which governs the microscopic world, and general relativity, which describes the macroscopic world of gravity and space-time.\n\nEfforts to understand quantum gravity have been focused almost entirely at the theoretical level, but Monika Schleier-Smith at Stanford University has been exploring a novel experimental approach — trying to create quantum gravity from scratch. Using laser-cooled clouds of atoms, she is testing the idea that gravity might be an emergent phenomenon arising from quantum entanglement.\n\nIn this episode of The Joy of Why podcast, Schleier-Smith discusses the thinking behind what she admits is a high-risk, high-reward approach, and how her experiments could provide important insights about entanglement and quantum mechanical systems even if the end goal of simulating quantum gravity is never achieved.\n\nListen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, TuneIn or your favorite podcasting app, or you can stream it from Quanta\n\nAll episodes Your browser does not support the audio element. / APPLE SPOTIFY\n\nTranscript\n\n[Music plays]\n\nSTEVE STROGATZ: Here we are. Hey, Janna.\n\nJANNA LEVIN: Hey Steve.\n\nSTROGATZ: I’ve got something really fun queued up for you today.\n\nLEVIN: Good. I’m looking forward to hearing about it.\n\nSTROGATZ: Okay. Now I think this should be kind of in your wheelhouse. It’s about gravity.\n\nLEVIN: Mmm. That’s definitely within my wheelhouse.\n\nSTROGATZ: And now let me add one more word. Quantum gravity.\n\nLEVIN: Yeah, and now it’s in no one’s wheelhouse!\n\nSTROGATZ: That’s interesting, isn’t it? Because it’s such a hard, open problem in physics. So, I had the chance to speak to a great young physicist named Monika Schleier-Smith. She’s at Stanford. And she is taking an approach I’ve never heard of anywhere else, which is to try to build a kind of toy model of quantum gravity in the laboratory.\n\nLEVIN: Wow.\n\nSTROGATZ: Funny thing, right? I mean, you think of quantum gravity as purely theoretical, pencil and paper stuff.\n\nLEVIN: Yeah, absolutely. That seems maximally hard.\n\nSTROGATZ: Maximally hard, right? Do you ever hear this idea that gravity might emerge from entanglement?\n\nLEVIN: Oh, yes. It’s one of my favorites, actually.\n\nSTROGATZ: Is it?\n\nLEVIN: Yeah. I find it really intriguing. I kind of think of it as the entanglement is like threads at the quantum level, and it embroiders a world that from afar looks like it’s smooth and continuous, and you look up close and you realize it’s really these entangled threads.\n\nSTROGATZ: Very poetic. I like it. Well, that is sort of the spirit of what we’re doing in this episode with Monika. She’s gonna talk to us about the ways that she tries to entangle thousands of atoms.\n\nLEVIN: Hmmm.\n\nSTROGATZ: That she has maintained at very low temperature so that they can express their quantum mechanical nature and get entangled. But it’s many-body quantum entanglement we’re talking about.\n\nLEVIN: So, they’re all entangled with each other as opposed to just pairs?\n\nSTROGATZ: Right. That’s the new wrinkle here. I’m only used to the idea of the, you know, you hear a lot about entangling two atoms or something like that in the old, like, Einstein Podolsky Rosen thought experiment, and then later recreations of that in the lab.\n\nThis is many-body entanglement, thousands of atoms. And I think she’s trying to stitch together some kind of fabric of space and time like you just described.\n\nLEVIN: Wow. I mean, I’m not sure how she would get gravity out of that quite yet, but that’s fascinating. I mean, I always thought there was a kind of monogamy of entanglement. So, if one particle was maximally entangled with another, it had to be monogamous. It could not also be entangled with a third partner.\n\nSTROGATZ: Well, that’s interesting. I’ve never heard that idea.\n\nLEVIN: So maybe each one is partially entangled with another, right, so they’re not maximally entangled one-to-one.\n\nSTROGATZ: Yeah.\n\nLEVIN: It’s a kind of polyamory of, uh, entanglement.\n\nSTROGATZ: Well, I knew you would get interested in this, and so I think we should just hear from Stanford physicist Monika Schleier-Smith.\n\n[Music plays]\n\nSTROGATZ: Hey, Monika, welcome to the show.\n\nMONIKA SCHLEIER-SMITH: Thank you.\n\nMonika Schleier-Smith\n\nSTROGATZ: Before we get rolling on the question of what you’ve been doing in quantum physics experiments, I read somewhere that you got an early start, even as a high school student doing nanotechnology in a lab.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: So, yeah, I was very fortunate as a high school student to get to do summer research internships at a company called the MITRE Corporation. I wasn’t yet working in the lab, but I was getting to really grapple with forefront issues of cutting-edge research in nanotechnology. And that was really remarkable being a 16-year-old getting to read scientific papers and be in a research group.\n\nSTROGATZ: Amazing. When you say you weren’t in the lab, did they have you doing computer simulations or what kind of thing?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: That’s right. I was doing computer simulations. I was developing some ideas that actually led to a patent. We were able to collaborate with a group at Penn State that had the expertise and was able to take it to the next level and led to actually publishable results. And after I left, they actually started a lab based on some of the ideas we’d been brainstorming about when I was there.\n\nSTROGATZ: What a great start to a scientific life. Should we picture you as a little kid with scientific parents or going out in the woods looking at bugs? Or what was your deep background?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Right, definitely going out into the woods exploring. My mother, actually, her background was in linguistics and really more in the humanities, but she always wished she had gone into science. And so that was a very strong influence. And I have an older brother who took the first steps in studying physics in college. And, I guess I was inspired and followed in those footsteps.\n\nSTROGATZ: Quite a family. Well, you’re part of this giant enterprise of modern physics and there’s this so-called Standard Model. I mean, it’s a super successful theory, but even the most ardent proponents of the Standard Model would agree that there are a few things to be filled in. Can you tell us a little about what is that model?\n\nThe question that has been explored in recent years in this effort to unify quantum mechanics and gravity is: Could it be that gravity is actually also an emergent phenomenon?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Yeah, so the Standard Model describes a wide range of particles that make up matter in our universe. Electrons, protons and their constituent quarks… photons.\n\nAnd part of the Standard Model, for example, is also that some of these particles are responsible for electric forces between charged particles, electrons and protons. There are additional particles that are responsible actually for mediating those forces. A photon is actually responsible for mediating these electric forces, kind of bouncing between the charged particles that are interacting.\n\nOne thing that’s missing actually in the Standard Model, one significant omission is a particle that mediates the force of gravity, right?\n\nSo in the same way that charged particles can attract or repel depending on their charges, gravity seems on the face of it very analogous. The mass of an object is kind of the equivalent to the charge. In the case of electric forces, the mass determines how strong the attractive force is in gravity.\n\nBut the Standard Model doesn’t have that equivalent of the photon for electromagnetism. It doesn’t have something like a graviton that would mediate the gravitational forces. It’s possible to have this theory, the Standard Model, that is extraordinarily well tested. But has this sort of glaring omission of gravity.\n\nSTROGATZ: Right, so you’ve mentioned it doesn’t have the counterpart of the photon, the graviton. I mean, we talk about gravitons, but they’re not part of the Standard Model. I hear there are a few other things like neutrinos. These tiny neutral particles shouldn’t have any mass, but they do.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Yeah. And there are big mysteries in our universe also about what we call dark matter and dark energy. You know, 70 percent of the energy that should be there is missing the form of this dark energy that we can’t account for. So, lots of big mysteries in the universe, even though the Standard Model is experimentally extraordinarily well tested.\n\nSTROGATZ: Okay. But you’ve put your finger specifically on this missing part of gravity in the Standard Model. And so that’s what we’ll be talking about mostly.\n\nSo, given that gravity is not in the Standard Model, even though we know it’s a real important force, it’s keeping us both in our seats at the moment, how is that hurting our current understanding of the universe? We do have a very excellent theory of gravity, Newton’s theory, or then, if we want to get fancier, Einstein’s general relativity.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: That’s right. We do have an excellent theory. Einstein’s general relativity is also extraordinarily well tested. If I go back to the analogy with electromagnetism the sort of classical picture is that electromagnetic forces, they’re mediated by electromagnetic waves or light. And in gravity we’ve by now even detected gravitational waves. Right, so in its own right, gravity is also very well understood and tested.\n\nAnd, at some level, the challenge is that the microscopic description is really kind of quantum mechanical. Quantum mechanics is a great theory for describing systems at very small scales. But gravity is a theory that works very well in the regime of massive objects. You know, the motion of planets. These are tested in very different regimes. It’s hard to get into a regime where actually both gravity and quantum mechanics matter.\n\nIt’s mostly so far in thought experiments that we realize, we don’t have a unified theory and that there’s something missing when we can’t connect the rules of quantum mechanics with the rules of gravity.\n\nSTROGATZ: That’s interesting, this last point that you just raised, because there are parts of relativity that play nicely with quantum theory, right? Like we do have special relativity.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: That’s right. And again, I think it’s partly this issue that one theory or the other applies well, or one can put in the minimal ingredients, let’s say special relativity of gravity, and combine that with quantum mechanics, but somehow a full unified theory is still missing.\n\nI mean, just to give one other example that I find kind of puzzling: In gravity, space and time are treated on an equal footing. In quantum mechanics, we actually don’t treat them on an equal footing. Systems evolve in time, and space is thought of completely separately. And so, somehow there are these two inconsistent ways of thinking about the universe, and one has to start doing thought experiments about things—like, what happens to information that falls into a black hole—to start to realize that actually to really fully understand our universe, we need to reconcile them.\n\nSTROGATZ: Hmm. I’m glad you put your finger on space and time because that’s really what we do want to be talking about here. I mean, they’re all linked up, aren’t they? Space, time, gravity, and then this other whole story of quantum mechanics.\n\nSo, let’s talk about this question of the possibility that space and time might not be as fundamental as we used to think.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Yeah, and so one of the remarkable ideas that’s emerged from theorists who think hard about this problem of reconciling quantum mechanics and gravity is the notion that perhaps the fundamental building blocks of gravity really are quantum mechanical.\n\nA number of years ago I found a quote from, you might say the father of the atom, Democritus, right? He was the Greek philosopher who, recognized that matter is not just some smooth, continuous thing. It has actually fundamental building blocks that are atoms and molecules.\n\nAnd then he made this point that phenomena such as, you know, hot and cold, sweet or bitter, taste, temperature, colors, emerge from the microscopic configurations of individual atoms or molecules. I don’t need to think about the positions of all the individual atoms to look at an object and say it’s red, right? And so color is this kind of emergent phenomenon.\n\nSo, the question that has been explored in recent years in this effort to unify quantum mechanics and gravity is: Could it be that gravity is actually also an emergent phenomenon? So the microscopic constituents are really quantum mechanical and gravity emerges as this sort of simplified, smooth description of what fundamentally is really some complex interacting quantum system.\n\nAnd I find that idea fascinating, and how might gravity emerge from quantum mechanics? The connection that’s conjectured is a phenomenon called entanglement.\n\nI’m fascinated by the idea that gravity in our universe might be an emergent phenomenon, where the building blocks are quantum mechanics.\n\nSTROGATZ: Go on, I want to hear more, because it is incredibly fascinating. The first time I heard it my mind was blown. Tell us.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Sure, so entanglement is the idea that I can store information, not just in individual bits or particles, but actually in correlations. So, you know, in your computer, you have information that’s stored in bits that are in like a one state or a zero state. And that information, it’s really stored locally in an individual bit.\n\nSo the quantum analog of a bit, we call it a qubit. And it’s possible to have information that’s not just stored in a single qubit. If you look at the state of a single qubit, it looks completely random. In fact, randomness is an inherent aspect of quantum mechanics.\n\nBut if you look at the states of two of these qubits, you would find they’re always either both one or they’re always both zero, even though each one individually looks random. And so there is actually some order in the randomness, some information that can be stored in a way that you can only access if you look at both of these qubits. So, this idea of correlations and information that are sort-of hidden in this randomness, that’s this notion of entanglement.\n\nAnd one of the sort-of challenges this brings up is that describing a quantum system is actually much more complex than describing the bits in your classical computer. Because you need to keep track not just of the states of the individual qubits, but of all of these correlations between them.\n\nSo sometimes I like to sort of visualize a graph where I have my row of these qubits, but then I want to sort-of draw some lines that indicate something about the structure of which ones are correlated with which ones. And that’s still an overly simplified description, but roughly speaking these correlations I can visualize as some connections between the qubits.\n\nAnd now the idea is that perhaps actually this notion of gravity being an emergent phenomenon, the idea is actually describing those correlations. And I kind of think of it as there’s this one additional dimension that allows me to capture extra information associated that describes the structure of correlations. There’s some mapping from the quantum mechanical system to actually a geometrical description in which the distance between the qubits says something about how strongly they’re correlated.\n\nThis notion has also been given the name of holographic duality. So why holographic? A hologram is something that has two dimensions, but actually it looks like a three-dimensional image, right? It has this sort of additional dimension.\n\nSo there’s this notion that somehow once one accounts for the entanglement between all these degrees of freedom, gravity may emerge as a description of those microscopic quantum building blocks. A sort of smooth macroscopic description in terms of space-time curvature and geometry.\n\nSTROGATZ: Okay. So that is a lot, a lot, a lot going on there.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: I know, yeah.\n\nSTROGATZ: And that’s fine because you’ve given us a lot to chew on now. You said this really deep, interesting thing that—if I can paraphrase and correct me if I’m not hearing you right—it’s sort of like saying distance is an illusion. What really is meaningful is correlation. Right, that’s sort of the idea. That things that look like they’re a certain distance apart, that’s our macroscopic way as big creatures of thinking about what microscopically is about strong correlations, or maybe weak correlations.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Yeah, exactly. Like a long distance would sort of correspond to a weaker correlation, roughly speaking. Exactly.\n\nSTROGATZ: Okay, so, we’ll have to come back to that, this idea that space and distance, it’s really just an emergent way of talking about what’s really going on under the hood, which is correlations of different strengths. So, you spoke about that there can be information in the relationship between two things that are otherwise completely random on their own.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Right, I kind of like to use the analogy of a coin toss, right? And so, like, imagine I’m here and I’m tossing coins. And every time I toss one, you’ll also toss a coin. And, when we look at the outcomes of those coin tosses, I’ll see something completely random. You’ll see a random sequence of heads and tails. And classically, that’s all there is to it and there’s no correlation.\n\nBut quantum mechanically, we could have a situation where every time I get heads, you get tails and every time I get tails, you get heads, despite the fact that I’m here in California and you’re…\n\nSTROGATZ: In Ithaca.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And so that would be very weird, right?\n\nSTROGATZ: Right. Especially where I’m far enough away that you couldn’t possibly get a signal to me fast enough to influence me.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Exactly. There were more and more experiments over the past 20 years or so trying to really make sure that we verified entanglement in a setting where these two measurements were far enough apart that there couldn’t be any information traveling between them and things like that.\n\nSTROGATZ: Okay. So, as it started, it was a very theoretical idea going back to the 1930s or something, right, from Einstein and Podolsky and Rosen and Schrödinger and people like that.\n\nWe use a very engineered setup in the lab where a photon can bounce between two atoms or between two clouds of atoms and introduce correlations and entanglement between them.\n\nBut now fast forwarding to almost a century later, it’s not obvious to me how you would maintain the entanglement over great distances. Does it take tremendous care to keep them entangled?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: It’s tremendously challenging and to bridge long distances, there are different choices you could make of photons because they travel at the speed of light across long distances. But even so there’s some possibility that the photon, if it’s sent through an optical fiber, that it’s lost along the way or also if it’s sent through free space, there’s still some chance it’ll get absorbed along the way.\n\nSometimes there are tricks, where you can do what’s called heralding, that like maybe you don’t succeed every time, but there’s a way to know actually whether you successfully created an entangled state.\n\nSTROGATZ: Huh, okay, but now it sounds like you and your students are doing this every day now. So maybe you should tell us, what are you entangling?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: In my lab, we work on smaller length scales, you know. So the particles that we entangle are atoms. And, an atom is an Angstrom scale object. Ordinarily, you would think that if I have two atoms that are, let’s say, a millimeter apart, they won’t interact, they won’t become correlated. But that’s actually a length skill where we are able to generate entanglement, and the way that we do it is in fact actually using light.\n\nI use this notion of mediating interactions. We use a very engineered setup in the lab where a photon can bounce between two atoms or between two clouds of atoms and introduce correlations and entanglement between them. And that’s not the only way that one can generate entanglement among atoms. I’ll focus on this one because one of the nice things about, photons is they can quickly bridge long distances, and they can give a lot of flexibility.\n\nNaively, you would think what will naturally happen is atoms will maybe bump into other atoms that are near them. And, you’ll sort of generate strong correlations between neighboring atoms. And what we like to be able to do is have some network, where we can actually control the structure of correlations and decide by some knobs in the experiment, the atoms that are most strongly correlated. That’s a way of using photons to program the graph of correlations in, in our case, an array of clouds of atoms.\n\nSTROGATZ: So I do want to hear about the clouds of atoms and the programmable networks that you’re building or engineering, but can you give us an aural picture. Like if we were standing behind you looking over your shoulder. What would we see?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: In any given lab in my research group you would see something like two to three optical tables. So each of these something like, four foot by eight foot, maybe even a bit bigger.\n\nThere’s usually one table that has a bunch of lasers, because I mentioned we need laser light as our tool for manipulating atoms. So, you’d see these lasers, you would see lots and lots of mirrors and various other optical elements to steer the lasers into the right places. And then, all of these laser beams get steered into optical fibers going from one table to another table, which carry that light to where our science experiments actually happen.\n\nAnd that second table has on it an ultra-high vacuum chamber, which we need in order to have particular atoms—in one of our labs its rubidium atoms—that are sort of well isolated from anything else in the lab, right? So, we want to be operating in an ultra-high vacuum environment, where I can just create a cloud or a few clouds of atoms that are at very low temperature and that are essentially suspended by laser beams in the middle of this vacuum chamber.\n\nSTROGATZ: These rubidium atoms are in what you’re calling high vacuum, so meaning they’re not bumping into any oxygen or nitrogen. There’s no air in there.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Right, yeah.\n\nSTROGATZ: They’re just rubidium atoms, which I don’t even really know why, how to think about rubidium. I’ve heard of rubidium.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: If you remember your periodic table.\n\nSTROGATZ: No, I don’t. What, tell me.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: I’ll just say it’s in the first column, and what that means is basically there’s one valence, so one outer electron that is relatively well isolated from all of the other electrons. And that actually turns out to be convenient for making it a relatively simple atom to control and manipulate with lasers.\n\nSTROGATZ: I see. And why do you want to have a cloud of them?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: So, I’ll say that I might actually prefer not to have a cloud, but we work with a cloud. For the class of experiments I described, where we use light photons as our means of generating some network of interactions between atoms, we can actually generate stronger interactions if we use many atoms rather than just one. If I go back to the wave picture of light, there’s constructive interference, a photon bouncing off one atom and hitting another atom to make them interact. If I have many atoms, the waves that they scatter can interfere constructively, and that can actually enhance the strength of interaction.\n\nSTROGATZ: Cool, OK.\n\nSTROGATZ: And so at least for kind of first experiments, it’s been convenient for us to work with, let’s say, clouds, where each cloud has a thousand atoms and then we have an array of such clouds. But there is a path that we’re interested in actually going towards single atoms where each atom interacts more strongly.\n\nSTROGATZ: Okay. But so for now, we could think of a cloud of 10,000 atoms or something. But you mentioned low temperature. So you want to tell us how low?\n\nThere’s a strongly interacting quantum system that has an equivalent description in terms of equations that look like gravity.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Yeah, so typically we work with temperatures that are on the scale of tens of microkelvin, a thousandth of a degree above absolute zero would be millikelvin. We’re often a factor of 20 or 50 below that in temperature.\n\nSTROGATZ: Wow.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: And so that sounds extraordinarily cold. One thing to keep in mind is actually the room isn’t cold, that vacuum chamber isn’t cold, if you touch it, it’s at room temperature.\n\nBut it’s just this cloud of atoms suspended by laser light that we are able to actually bring to very low temperature using tricks of laser cooling.\n\nSTROGATZ: There’s some way of using the lasers to hit the atoms in just the right way that sort of knocks the wind out of them .\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Exactly, that’s a great analogy.\n\nSTROGATZ: Okay. I see. So, I’m getting the picture now. You’ve got these clouds, 10,000 atoms. You get them very cold, not to the point where they’re a single quantum object in the sense of Bose-Einstein condensate, but still they’re constructively interfering in the wave picture enough that it’s sort of like a strong edge in this network of interactions that you’re trying to build.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: And I can also just add the reason we don’t need to get them down to this state of matter of Bose-Einstein condensation, it turns out if the atoms are moving around a little bit, that’s okay for the experiments that we do. There’s still a sense in which we place all of our atoms in a given cloud. into the same quantum state.\n\nSo they’re not all at the same position. But what we care about most in our experiments is some internal state of the atom. So there’s that electron we talked about, and we control which state that electron is in. We control which way its spin is pointing. And so we have actually very good control over the internal states of these atoms, and those will all be identical in a given cloud.\n\nSTROGATZ: Uh-huh. So, is the entanglement that you’re trying to set up at the level of spins then? Because, I mean, I know in the traditional old thought experiments about entanglement, they used to frequently talk about the spin of two different particles.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Exactly. And so, the spin is sort of the real physical implementation of what I talked about before with the heads and tails of the coin, right? These two possible states of the coin are like a spin that points up or down. Actually, in quantum mechanics, a spin could point anywhere in three dimensions. But when we decide to do a measurement, we have to choose what we call a basis. We can measure does it point up or down, does it point right or left. But we actually can’t determine both of those things at the same time. This is another example of these incompatible observables that I spoke about earlier. Position and momentum of a particle were one example. Two different components of the spin, the vertical or the horizontal, would be another example.\n\nSTROGATZ: Okay. So now we’ve got the visual of you in your lab and the optical table and all the lasers and mirrors and cables. But then, now that you have this ability to entangle these clouds, you can make whatever networks you want, if I’m hearing you right. You know, you’re doing this very fundamental research about what in the jargon might be called something like many-body entanglement, so that’s sure to be important.\n\nI’m sad that [Steve Gubser] didn’t get to see the experiment, and I still find it really motivating to try to kind of push forward and continue.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Right. So, having control over entanglement can be a resource for making better precision measurements when what limits you is quantum uncertainty, the sort of randomness inherent in quantum mechanics. Or another one, quantum computation, the idea is if you have a sufficiently well controlled quantum system, where you can really program in the interactions in the same way that you program your classical computer, but now the building blocks are quantum bits, then one place that seems very natural to give us an advantage is precisely in describing quantum mechanical systems—be it the behavior of electrons and materials, or be it actually problems from chemistry, for example.\n\n[Music plays]\n\nLEVIN: Um, I’m kind of dumbfounded a little bit.\n\nSTROGATZ: Uh huh.\n\nLEVIN: I mean, you have these many body systems. She’s somehow managed to entangle them in this kind of a network. How do I get from there to gravity? Why would I think it’s gravity and not some other complex system that emerges from the many-body problem.\n\nSTROGATZ: That’s really a good question. I think she is looking for signatures of something that would be like a discreet analog of curvature, of a continuous space. So networks can have properties like curvature, the way that smooth manifolds can have curvature.\n\nLEVIN: Oh, I see. Amazing. So she’s trying to make a space time or like a manifold or something?\n\nSTROGATZ: It’s something like you said with your beautiful analogy of the embroidered fabric, that it might look like a nice smooth dress, but you look up close, it’s a lot of threads stitched together.\n\nLEVIN: Right. Oh, fascinating. So the network itself is an emerging space-time in some sense?\n\nSTROGATZ: Something like that. But it’s controversial what she’s doing. And as she says, it’s also possible that this won’t lead to a deeper understanding of gravity, but maybe it will help with precision measurements or maybe it will help with quantum computing. We’re gonna get right into that after the break.\n\n[Music plays]\n\nSTROGATZ: Welcome back to the Joy of Why. We’re speaking with Stanford physicist, Monika Schleier-Smith, who’s been telling us about her toy model of gravity.\n\nSo there is a certain amount of controversy attached to this idea that gravity and space-time emerge from quantum entanglement. We haven’t really said that out loud, but maybe we should. So like, even if that doesn’t pan out, you’re not wasting your time, I think, in the lab.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: I like to think not, again, it’s not the only thing I’m working on, but also, for me, I’m fascinated by the idea that gravity in our universe might be an emergent phenomenon, where the building blocks are quantum mechanics. But there’s also another way to think about this whole field, which is to say, there are certain cases where one sees this so-called duality. So, there’s a strongly interacting quantum system that has an equivalent description in terms of equations that look like gravity.\n\nAnd whether or not gravity in our universe is a manifestation of quantum mechanics, these theoretical tools of taking a strongly interacting quantum mechanical system and mapping them to a description in terms of curved space and gravity, maybe that gives you new ways of calculating things about the quantum mechanical system or new insights into how it will behave.\n\nSTROGATZ: Okay. I’m sold that this is good. So, maybe you should tell me then about this kind of toy model of gravity. What do these networks have to do with quantum gravity and space time?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Yeah. You know, this effort at understanding quantum gravity has been almost purely the domain of theory until recently. And so my thought was if gravity might be an emergent phenomenon, if curved space might be something that can emerge as a natural description of quantum correlations, can we build a system where we start to see this phenomenon of something that looks like curved space emerging as a description of the quantum correlations.\n\nBefore we did an experiment, rather serendipitously, we began talking with a theorist at Princeton named Steve Gubser, who actually tragically passed away in a climbing accident a few years ago.\n\nBut Steve was working on this effort to reconcile quantum mechanics and gravity. He had developed I would say a particular version of this holographic duality. Right, so holographic duality was this notion that I have a quantum mechanical system that I can think of as kind of living on the boundary where the higher dimensional space has gravity, and the gravity gives rise to curvature in that space, and the distances within that higher dimensional space say something about correlations in the quantum system on the boundary.\n\nWhat was really valuable to us about talking to Steve Gubser was that he was working on a formulation of this holographic duality, where there’s a very nice way of actually visualizing bulk geometry.\n\nHe wanted actually a discretized theory. So, what do I mean by that? He wanted there to be a shortest length scale in his theory, motivated actually by the fact that in our universe there’s a length scale called the Planck length, where you expect to start running into major problems in reconciling quantum mechanics and gravity and anyway.\n\nSo Steve had this discretized version of holographic duality where the bulk geometry is represented by a tree and the boundary where the quantum mechanical system lives, lives on the leaves of the tree.\n\nSTROGATZ: Ah, nice.\n\nEven if it helped gives some new insight to the theorists that then take that to the next level to learn something about gravity in our universe, that would be amazing.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: So you can kind of imagine if you’re at the trunk of the tree, that’s somewhere in the middle of the bulk, somewhere in the middle of the part that’s described by gravity. And then that trunk has two branches, and each of those has two more branches, and each of those has two more branches. In just a few steps, the number of leaves actually grows exponentially with the distance that you go out from the trunk.\n\nIf you think of the tree as kind-of radiating outwards so that the leaves end up on a circle, you have this weird thing where, the circumference of that circle, it’s actually exponentially larger than the distance measured in how many times you need to branch to get to the leaf.\n\nSo we have this graph, and again, I kind of think of it as I can visualize it as the leaves live on the circumference of a circle, the circumference is exponentially larger than the diameter instead of being larger by a factor of pi. And so somehow, like, this isn’t just a flat disk. It’s curved, and it actually has negative curvature.\n\nSTROGATZ: Oh, I see. You’re saying that’s why it’s curved, because if it were just a flat disk, it should only be the, two pi times the radius. But this is way more circumference than that.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Exactly. If anyone in the audience has seen, some prints by Escher. So like, he’ll tile a disk with fish, and in the middle there are big fish and around the circumference there are lots of really tiny fish. And that actually really is a representation of this hyperbolic geometry.\n\nSTROGATZ: Yeah, and why hyperbolic? I mean, there’s also this nice picture of like, if you’re trying to flatten out a rug, it may be fine. But if you try to flatten out a piece of lettuce or something that looks like a saddle, it keeps popping up, right? You can’t flatten it out easily. And it’s because it has too much circumference for its distance from the center. So that’s what negative curved space is kind of like.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Exactly. And so this tree graph is discretized version of this negatively curved space or what is called anti-de Sitter space in the context of general relativity and gravity.\n\nSo we kind of asked ourselves, is there a quantum mechanical system we can build that would have correlations that make it sort of look like it lives on the leaves of a tree graph. And we realized, there’s a toy model where a given site in my array can talk to its nearest neighbor, its second neighbor, its fourth neighbor, its eighth neighbor. It’s not a lot of connections that you need to build, but they give you an efficient way of getting information from one point to any other.\n\nIf it answers questions about gravity in our universe, that’s amazing, but even if it doesn’t, we won’t have wasted our time.\n\nSo we had actually been thinking about that, and then we got in touch with Steve Gubser and he pointed out, if you tweak this model just a little bit so that the longest range interactions are the strongest, like the atoms that are far apart physically actually have the strongest interactions, that might make it look like your system of atoms lives on the leaves of a tree graph.\n\nSTROGATZ: Mm hmm. And so what would you have to measure to see a signature that the counterpart of space is being curved?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Essentially, we measure spin correlations. If a given spin is pointing to the right, how likely is it that another site of our array also has the spin pointing to the right?\n\nSo, my students started thinking about what’s a clever way to plot these data. You have to put some constraints on how you plot it. It’s nice to plot things on a page, so in two dimensions. And so, he ended up with some plot where the sites ended up arranged around a circle. The ones where we measured the strongest correlations were close to each other. And the order of the sites is actually very different from what it is in our physical system, but it’s a nice way of representing things as near each other if the correlations between them are strong.\n\nAnd then he also started drawing lines. So, pairs of sites with the strongest correlations, he drew a line between them, and then he sort-of treated those as a new, bigger site. Asked what’s the average direction the spin is pointing on that bigger site, and by iterating that process, the picture that popped out was precisely this tree graph.\n\nSTROGATZ: Let me make sure I understand one aspect, though. Since you have so much ability to program who’s interacting with who, what part of the results is a surprise to you? How much is built-in and how much is not built-in?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Yeah, so at some level, when we did the experiment, you know, we did know what we thought should come out.\n\nSTROGATZ: Right.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: We didn’t know yet how we would analyze the data, and this way of actually visualizing the tree graph, came up in discussions between me and my students and that wasn’t something we had thought about before we did the experiment. In general, we often start with something where we know what should happen, and the goal is eventually, and we’re not there yet to be honest, but the goal is eventually to get somewhere where we actually don’t know what will happen.\n\nThere are some proposals for more kind of agnostic methods of trying to go from a quantum mechanical system to determine does it have an emergent description in terms of some curved higher dimensional space? What is the geometry? What is the metric on that higher-dimensional space?\n\nSo, I think that’s an important direction for future research, is to go beyond just we build a toy model where we know what should happen. There’s lots more one can do quantitatively. And actually since then we’ve been developing tools where we actually do, not in the tree graph, but in simpler settings, really probe the spatial structure of entanglement.\n\nSo, I really think it’s a first step to even start to connect. Part of it is even connecting two different communities, right? Figuring out a common language for even talking to theorists who think about gravity when all they know is quantum mechanics.\n\nSTROGATZ: Well, I hope this is not a too sensitive question, but you mentioned Steve Gubser, who I didn’t know, was he alive to see the triumph of, you know, his insight about how to do the setup, that it did really work?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: He was not alive to see us do the experiment. Yeah, so we had a theoretical proposal published in Physical Review Letters and it was really shortly after we wrapped that up that he tragically passed away in this climbing accident. I’m sad that he didn’t get to see the experiment, and I still find it really motivating to try to kind of push forward and continue.\n\nSTROGATZ: He clearly had some great insight because as you say, it didn’t seem obvious that that was the way to set things up.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: No, yeah.\n\nSTROGATZ: Well, the whole thing really seems very high risk to me, I have to say, high risk, high reward. I’m just wondering is that kind of who you are? Are you that type of scientist?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: I’m somebody who looks for some of the problems I work on to be ones that everybody else isn’t also working on. My sense is, you know, if everybody else is already doing a thing, like I might not need to do it. And yeah, maybe that does draw me into things that are a little bit more on the risky side.\n\nAnd this direction of simulating quantum gravity is one that I find high risk, high reward. But that same toolbox has applications in enhanced precision measurements, in quantum computation. Even if it helped gives some new insight to the theorists that then take that to the next level to learn something about gravity in our universe, that would be amazing. If it even just gives us new ways of thinking about quantum mechanical systems, right? That can help us in that effort to engineer and understand quantum many-body systems be it for applications in precision sensing, computation, understanding the design of materials, right?\n\nI think there’s a broad effort to control and understand entanglement, that will benefit from research in this area. And if it answers questions about gravity in our universe, that’s amazing, but even if it doesn’t, we won’t have wasted our time.\n\nThis direction of simulating quantum gravity is one that I find high risk, high reward.\n\nSTROGATZ: I agree. It seems sort of surefire in a way. It can’t possibly be as risky as it sounds because, as you say, how could it hurt to learn more about how to control quantum systems and manipulate them with entanglement, that has to be good.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: That’s what I think, yeah.\n\nSTROGATZ: Well, okay. so, let me close with kind of an emotional question: What is it that really fires you up? What are you really trying to do? What’s your motivation?\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: I really think that it does help get me motivated to know that something we learn in our experiments may have practical application, but it’s not important to me personally that that application is tomorrow. If it’s 50 years down the line and actually it’s not the application we thought it would be and it’s a different one, that’s fine with me.\n\nSo, I think I do believe deeply that fundamental science will ultimately have technological impact. But I enjoy it also just for the kind-of thrill of being at the frontier of the unknown and trying to push that frontier forward.\n\nSTROGATZ: Well, it’s so exciting to hear about this. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us today, Monika. And, thanks for being on The Joy of Why.\n\nSCHLEIER-SMITH: Thank you. It was a pleasure to chat.\n\n[Music plays]\n\nLEVIN: I love this high-risk statement. I absolutely love that she said she likes to at least do some of her work in an area which is not crowded, that nobody else is working on. I love both those things. I really appeal to me and, I think it’s where a lot of the great stuff happens.\n\nSTROGATZ: But I wonder if your reaction is a little bit of a reflection of who you are.\n\nLEVIN: Oh, absolutely.\n\nSTROGATZ: You know, I don’t think this is for everybody.\n\nLEVIN: It’s not, it’s not. And obviously if you’re gonna build the James Webb Space Telescope, you don’t wanna be a high-risk thinker. I mean, it’s a very risky project, right. But it was clear and well-defined, and the reason it was late and over budget is because they were minimizing the risk. So, you definitely don’t want everybody being like that. You want people to collaborate on big projects together and move in the same direction. But yeah, absolutely. My whole life, people were telling me, “Don’t, don’t work on that. Nobody’s doing that.”\n\nSTROGATZ: Well, I think the secret is sort of like in relationships where you are looking for the match. And so I feel like there’s a lot of ways to be a good scientist or mathematician, and you have to know yourself. So Monika, clearly is not scared of risks. She’s thinking about the long game. You know, she reminds me of Gaudí, that Sagrada Família in Barcelona. You know, he didn’t get to live to see it finished, but he had a great vision and they’re still building it as far as I can tell.\n\nLEVIN: Yeah, an interminable project.\n\nSTROGATZ: But it’s not for everyone. Not everyone has that kind of nerve. Like she could hit the jackpot or she might, you know, get a nice little payout.\n\nLEVIN: Mm-hmm. You know, it sounds like there’s a lot of potential unanticipated consequences. I find that really inspiring. We throw something out in the world and we have to see who else is there to pick it up.\n\nSTROGATZ: Well, it’s always a pleasure to chat with you about these things\n\nLEVIN: And you, Steve.\n\nSTROGATZ: Thanks, Janna. All right, well, we’ll see you next time.\n\nLEVIN: We’ll see you next time.\n\n[Music plays]\n\nLEVIN: Thanks for listening.

            "content": "Maria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nGoogle's Imagen 3 is a powerful AI text-to-image generator that earned ZDNET's pick as the best image generator -- even against competitors like Midjourney and OpenAI. As a result, the release of its Veo 2 text-to-video generator has been highly anticipated. Well, it's finally here, and it comes with a surprise.\n\nAlso: The top 20 AI tools of 2025 - and the #1 thing to remember when you use them\n\nHow to try Veo 2 in Gemini\n\nOn Tuesday, Google announced via a blog post that its state-of-the-art Veo 2 video generator is now available in Gemini. This feature allows users to create eight-second video clips at 720p resolution in a 16:9 landscape format using a simple text prompt.\n\nAccording to Google, Veo 2 was designed to produce high-quality videos that better understand real-world physics and human motion to create videos that have \"lifelike scenes\" and \"fluid character movement.\" To create these videos, users can be as detailed as they like, giving them as much control as they want.\n\nAlso: 5 easy Gemini settings tweaks to protect your privacy from AI\n\nThe caveat? The experience is only rolling out to Gemini Advanced users worldwide on the web and mobile, part of the Google One AI Premium plan, which costs $20 per month.\n\nEven with the subscription, there is a monthly limit to the number of videos users can create. Google doesn't specify the limit, but it says it will notify users when they are getting close. However, if $20 per month seems expensive, it's the same cost required for OpenAI's Sora access via ChatGPT Plus.\n\nAlso: Gemini Pro 2.5 is a stunningly capable coding assistant - and a big threat to ChatGPT\n\nThe Google One AI Premium plan also comes with other perks, such as 2TB of storage, NotebookLM Plus with five-times higher usage limits and premium features, Gemini in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more, and another feature unveiled today, Whisk Animate.\n\nWhisk Animate\n\nWhisk Animate is a new Google generative AI experiment powered by Veo 2. It builds on Whisk's previous capabilities, which let users create new images from text and image prompts, and now lets them animate the images into eight-second videos. As mentioned above, this feature is also limited to Gemini Advanced users and can be accessed via Google Labs.\n\nHow does Veo 2 compare to Sora?\n\nBoth are quite similar in terms of what OpenAI and Google's text-to-video generators can do.\n\nWith ChatGPT Plus, Sora can create videos up to 720p resolution and 10 seconds in duration, while with Gemini Advanced, Veo 2 can create eight-second video clips at 720p resolution.\n\nAlso: 3 lucrative side hustles you can start right now with OpenAI's Sora video generator\n\nUltimately, the quality of the videos generated will be the determining factor in which is better, and as soon as I get my hands on both, I'll do a comprehensive analysis.\n\nUntil then, figuring out which plan to choose will likely come down to which AI chatbot you use more. If you are a ChatGPT power user, ChatGPT Plus offers many other perks, such as unlimited access to GPT-4o image generation, making it a better alternative.\n\nHowever, if you use Google's suite of productivity apps such as Gmail, Slides, Meet, or Sheets, the Gemini integration into those apps might make the Google One AI Premium plan a better fit.\n\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

We already shared with you Google’s announcement that the upgrades were spreading from the Pixel 9 series to the rest of Google’s Pixel lineup, but that’s just a fraction of what this expansion actually covers.\n\nIn this message posted to X, Google is clear that this is no Pixel exclusive, and *all* Android devices with access to Gemini will be seeing this new capability arrive over the next few weeks. Original article, April 17, 2025 (12:49 AM ET): Google has started rolling out Gemini Live with camera and screen sharing to all Pixel phones. The company announced the update on X, noting that the feature will start reaching “all Pixel owners” today, with the rollout continuing over the next few weeks.\n\nBack in April, Google introduced Gemini Live with camera and screen sharing for the Pixel 9 lineup and Galaxy S25 series. At the time, the company stated that older Pixel devices and other Android phones would need a Gemini Advanced subscription to access the feature. It now appears that Google has lifted that restriction for Pixel phones.\n\nGoogle\n\nGemini Live with camera and screen sharing works through the Gemini app, letting users share their camera view or screen in real time to ask questions.\n\nWhen you tap the “Share screen with Live” button in the Gemini assistant overlay, you’ll see options to record and share your screen. Once active, you can ask Gemini questions about whatever’s on your screen or in front of your camera, and the AI assistant will respond as accurately as possible.\n\nThis feature is part of Google’s experimental next-gen AI assistant, Project Astra, which is designed to respond to your surroundings in real time. Project Astra was unveiled at Google I/O last year, and its capabilities are expected to extend to upcoming Android XR devices as well."

            "description": "Copilot is everything from a chatbot to an image generator and a sidebar assistant. Here's what you need to know about Microsoft artificial intelligence.",
            "content": "Microsoft just celebrated its 50th anniversary. The tech giant's success story means it's now often referred to as one of the Big Tech Big Five or Magnificent Seven companies, given Microsoft's central role in the evolution of personal computing in the last five decades. And now, it's at the top of the artificial intelligence game as well.\n\nSince OpenAI's ChatGPT launched in November 2022, tech companies have been delving into the potential of generative AI. Microsoft joined forces with OpenAI for a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment. One of the results of this partnership is the creation of Microsoft's own AI tool, Copilot.\n\nCopilot launched in 2023 as a successor to Bing Chat, which, in a way, evolved from Cortana, though it used a different underlying technology. But you get my point: Microsoft's virtual assistants have had a long evolution.\n\nMicrosoft did have a couple of false starts with AI, though -- like its Recall feature, which was quickly dropped from Copilot Plus PCs (though Microsoft said last week it's ready to try again with Recall). But I'll talk more about that and other privacy concerns later.\n\nSo, what exactly is Microsoft Copilot? It's an AI assistant, a chatbot, an app -- a little bit of everything. The umbrella term Copilot can be a bit confusing, so let's explore what it means in its applications and how you can use it.\n\nCopilot is Microsoft's branding for various AI-powered tools embedded across its ecosystem, including in Windows, Edge, Bing, Microsoft 365 (all the Office apps), Teams, GitHub and security tools. You can also download the Copilot app on your iOS and Android devices.\n\nThe branding has also expanded to PCs as Microsoft rolled out an AI laptop, Copilot Plus PC. Windows 11 laptops and Copilot Plus PCs both come with a dedicated Copilot key that lets you jump straight into your AI assistant with one click on a keyboard.\n\nCopilot is powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o and Dall-E 3 in addition to Microsoft's own proprietary Prometheus model. It uses large language models to write text, create images and songs, search the web, summarize emails, generate code, automate tasks and assist you across the apps you probably already use.\n\nCopilot vs. other AI chatbots\n\nMicrosoft / Screenshot by CNET\n\nBecause it's an AI chatbot, you can compare Copilot to ChatGPT, Perplexity, DeepSeek and Anthropic's Claude (though Claude isn't connected to the internet like the rest). These are all standalone chatbots where you enter prompts and get responses.\n\nCopilot can also appear inside your apps and work directly with your content. For example, instead of asking ChatGPT to write an email and then copying it into Outlook, Copilot lives inside Outlook and generates the draft using your email history and context. It saves time and reduces the number of steps to get things done.\n\nAs an AI assistant, it resembles how Google's Gemini works across its software products, but Copilot is more tightly embedded into productivity tools. Meta AI is also integrated across its social platforms, but is better for casual and creative use.\n\nWhat can Microsoft Copilot do?\n\nMicrosoft / Screenshot by CNET\n\nOn Windows 11, Copilot is built directly into the taskbar as a sidebar assistant. You can use it for system settings, emptying the recycle bin, finding files and more. Edge also includes Copilot, offering contextual assistance like summarizing articles or comparing products while you browse. Imad Khan, a CNET senior writer covering AI, liked Copilot in Bing so much that it became his default search engine after he reviewed it. And if you're a developer, GitHub Copilot can suggest code snippets as you type.\n\nWhen you use Microsoft 365 Copilot, the AI draws from the context of your files and data, like calendars or chats (with your permission), to generate content or provide suggestions. In Word, it can draft, edit and summarize documents. In Excel, it can build formulas, analyze data and generate charts. It'll whip up a deck for you in PowerPoint based on a prompt or a Word doc. Outlook Copilot drafts emails and summarizes threads. In Teams, it can generate meeting summaries and pull context from chats you weren't paying attention to (we've all been there).\n\nCopilot also now has a new Windows app and Copilot Vision for your phone, which can analyze your photos in real time.\n\nHow much does Copilot cost?\n\nThere are different versions and paywalls for Copilot, depending on the platform.\n\nFor individual users, a more limited but still very useful version of Copilot is available for free in Windows 11, Edge, Bing and as a mobile app. There's also Copilot Pro for individuals, which costs $20 per month and includes priority performance during peak times, faster image creation and enhanced AI features in selected apps if you have a Microsoft 365 subscription.\n\nCopilot for Microsoft 365 is aimed at business users and costs $30 per user per month. This version includes the AI tools embedded in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams. But it requires specific licenses to use. Microsoft 365 Copilot prices might increase in some parts of the world.\n\nThere are also Microsoft 365 Business Plans plus Copilot plans, which vary in price per user. GitHub Copilot has separate pricing for individuals and businesses, too.\n\nThe most expensive version is Copilot Studio, priced at $210 or a pay-as-you-go option, which lets you create your own AI agents.\n\nMicrosoft / Screenshot by CNET\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nAI tools integrated into the software we use daily can quietly blur the line between helpful and intrusive. Since Copilot is built into everything from your desktop to your search engine, it's constantly watching, analyzing and learning from your activity to be more useful. It makes you wonder if surveillance is often masked with convenience.\n\nAshique KhudaBukhsh, professor of software engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology, who specializes in AI and Natural Language Processing, and who also used to work as a software developer for Microsoft, said the tech giant's security standards are pretty high. But he also admits: \"As the AI tools increasingly operate across diverse platforms, there is an elevated risk that the data may bleed from one system into another.\"\n\n\"The job of the user is to make sure that whenever you are, say, opening or downloading a new application or something, there is fine print where you can actually opt out,\" KhudaBukhsh says.\n\nHe says vulnerable groups, like senior citizens, should be educated and trained so they are up to speed with the risks of AI and can protect themselves until there is more regulatory oversight of this.\n\nBut KhudaBukhsh also notes there are some common misconceptions about AI and privacy. \"AI systems are [not] intrinsically invasive,\" he explains, since \"many of these systems are built with privacy by design principles.\"\n\nWhile AI tools need access to data to function, \"systems with reputation typically anonymize and process that data in ways that do not have enduring personal records.\" So even if you unintentionally share something sensitive, he says there are checks and balances to make sure personally identifiable information, like SSNs, is removed. He says this is true even when your info is being used in training data.\n\nOne stumble Microsoft had with AI and privacy was Copilot's Recall feature. This AI memory tool was designed to help you find things you've seen on your screen. You describe what you remember, and it pulls results from your timeline of screenshots (called snapshots), which it periodically takes of your activity. Everything happens locally on your Copilot Plus PC and nothing is uploaded to the cloud or sent to Microsoft. You'd also need to opt in for this feature and sign in with biometrics through Windows Hello.\n\nAfter heavy criticism over privacy concerns, Recall was pulled from general release and is only now beginning to gradually roll out in preview to Windows Insiders as of April 10. Microsoft also announced enhanced data protection for Copilot at the end of last year.\n\nMicrosoft did not provide comment on AI and privacy.\n\nNew features and releases\n\nMicrosoft calls Copilot its \"ultimate AI companion\" and continues expanding where and how it advances. The company announced several new features in February and March, like product price tracking for all US users. Think Deeper's reasoning model has been upgraded to OpenAI's o3-mini (high) and now offers unlimited access for free, along with the Voice feature.\n\nI created this image on my iPhone in WhatsApp after giving Copilot the prompts. Screenshot by CNET\n\nInteracting with Copilot across messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram has also been extended to GroupMe and Viber. To activate this feature, scan a QR code on apps' support pages or add the Copilot's chat number (+1 877-224-1042) to your contacts.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot is one of the better AI assistants currently available, thanks to its deep integration across Microsoft's ecosystem. It's designed to help with your productivity and alleviate the dread of mundane tasks.\n\nLike every AI tool CNET has reviewed so far, it's not perfect. But if you're already using Microsoft software, Copilot could make your daily workflow easier.\n\nJust remember that, like all other AI tools, it can hallucinate or offer outdated information. You also should be wary of the personal data you share when you use any AI system.\n\nAs KhudaBukhsh says, \"It could be very convenient to use technology, but at the same time, we need to be very mindful of what we are sharing, and if we are understanding the trade-off between convenience and security.\""

            "content": "A Porsche 911 GT3, with the optional Weissach Package, just set the fastest time ever for a manual production car around the famed Nürburgring in Germany. The manual 911 GT3 went around the 12.94-mile track in 6:56.294 minutes.\n\nThe 502 hp car set the record on a sunny day at the track, with the air temperature at 54 degrees Fahrenheit and an asphalt temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Porsche attributed the biggest improvements in the car to the chassis, which was more stable over curbs and bumps. Porsche also said that gear ratios were shorter, sending more power to the rear axle. According to the German marque, the car likely would’ve gone a few seconds faster with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, but setting the manual-transmission record was part of the point.\n\n“With the six-speed manual gearbox, I definitely had more to do on the fast lap and thus also a bit more fun,” Joerg Bergmeister, the driver, said in a statement.\n\nThe previous manual-production-car record at the Nürburgring was set by the Dodge Viper ACR in 2017 with a time of 7:01.3 minutes, according to Motor1.\n\nPorsche 911 GT3 at Nürburgring Rossen Gargolov\n\nNürburgring records are fiercely contested by automakers, especially German automakers, because it’s a lengthy and difficult test of speed on a track with the richest history of any circuit in the country, and perhaps any in Europe.\n\nThe manual 911 GT3’s time of 6:56.294 minutes also puts it among the fastest sports cars ever around the ‘Ring, with the Porsche 991 GT2 RS Manthey Performance Kit going fastest at 6:43.300 minutes, the Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series second in 6:48.047 minutes, the Porsche 911 GT3 RS third-fastest at 6:49.328 minutes, and the Porsche 911 GT3 Manthey Performance Kit fourth-fastest at 6:55.737 minutes. The manual 911 GT3’s time is over a second quicker than the fifth-fastest sports car, the Ford Mustang GTD, which lapped the track in 6:57.685 minutes. (All times per the Nürburgring’s website.)\n\nPorsche 911 GT3 at Nürburgring Porsche\n\nPorsche expressed some extra glee at setting the manual-transmission record, and said manual transmission sales for the 911 GT3 are up, too.\n\n“More and more customers of the 911 GT3 are opting for the six-speed manual transmission. And more and more often we are asked by these customers how fast a 911 GT3 with manual transmission would be on the Nordschleife”, Andreas Preuninger, Porsche’s director of GT cars, said in a statement. “We have now answered this question.”"

Specifically, the company is accused of trying to create an illegal monopoly in consumer social networking by buying up Facebook competitor Instagram, as well as messaging app WhatsApp.\n\nThis is the second round in a case which was first brought back in 2020. Meta succeeded then in having the case dismissed, but the judge did allow the FTC to provide more detailed arguments on why it thinks a monopoly was created by the acquisitions. The commission did so, and a new trial is underway.\n\nIf Meta loses the case, it could be forced to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nOne of Meta’s defences is that Apple’s Messages app is more popular than each of Instagram DMs, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp. It argued that you can’t separate social network messaging apps from more general ones like iMessage, given the ways in which consumers use them.\n\nAs part of making this case, Meta showed redacted slides in which the actual percentage usage was hidden. However, The Verge quickly discovered that these redactions had been made simply by applying solid black boxes as a layer in the PDF, and this layer could be trivially removed to reveal the underlying content. This is a very well-known flawed method of redacting PDFs.\n\nLawyers representing Apple were among those to comment on the “egregious” error.\n\nAttorneys for both Apple and Snap called the errors “egregious,” with Apple’s representative indicating that it may not be able to trust Meta with its internal information in the future. Google’s attorney also blamed Meta for jeopardizing the search giant’s data with the mistake.\n\n9to5Mac’s Take\n\nThe data revealed wasn’t especially interesting – it only showed that 88% of US iPhone owners had used the Messages app within the past week. While Apple has never revealed this percentage, any of us would have guessed that usage was extremely high.\n\nThe utter incompetence of the redaction has led some to suggest it was deliberate, but personally I suspect Hanlon’s Razor applies: “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.”\n\nHighlighted accessories\n\nPhoto by Phil Hearing on Unsplash"

            "content": "Baldur's Gate 3 is closing out its development with a massive final patch, and it's a gift to fans who've stuck with one of our best PC games since its launch.\n\nLarian Studios' Patch 8 is the last major content update for the roleplaying game, but it's much more than bug fixes. This latest patch introduces cross-platform multiplayer, an all-new photo mode and a full set of new subclasses that shake up how every class plays. In short, it's a major update and one that cements the game's legacy as the studio prepares to move on.\n\nWhether you're just getting your sea legs with a brand-new game of Baldur's Gate or you're a seasoned player ready to see it through to the end, here's everything that's packed into this epic send-off.\n\nLarian Studios\n\nCross-play means no more walls between platforms\n\nThe biggest feature of Patch 8 is full cross-play across PC, Mac, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. You can now jump into multiplayer sessions with friends on any supported platform, with cross-save support also letting you carry your progress between devices if you're using a linked Larian account.\n\nGetting started is simple: Connect your game to your Larian profile, enable cross-play in the gameplay settings, and add friends using their Larian usernames. After that, you can join or host multiplayer sessions no matter what system you or your friends play on.\n\nMod support is also part of the mix, but with some caveats. Everyone in a cross-play session needs the exact same mod setup, and console users are capped at 100 mods. Mods must be installed via Larian's in-game manager (not through third-party tools), so keep that in mind when you're looking for a new favorite to try out.\n\nA dozen new subclasses refresh every class\n\nEach of the game's 12 core classes now has a brand-new subclass option, expanding the possibilities for players who want to try something different in their next campaign. Whether you're into arcane sniping, necrotic magic or charming enemies into submission, there's a new flavor for everyone.\n\nSome highlights include the Swashbuckler for Rogues, bringing fast, flashy melee combat; the Circle of Stars for Druids, which draws on celestial energy; and the Hexblade for Warlocks, who forge pacts with sentient weapons.\n\nThese subclasses aren't just cosmetic changes -- they include unique mechanics, new spells and custom animations that meaningfully change how each character plays. Here's the complete list of new subclasses you can now choose from:\n\nPath of the Giant Barbarian\n\nCollege of Glamour Bard\n\nDeath Domain Cleric\n\nCircle of Stars Druid\n\nArcane Archer Fighter\n\nWay of the Drunken Master Monk\n\nOath of the Crown Paladin\n\nSwarmkeeper Ranger\n\nSwashbuckler Rogue\n\nShadow Magic Sorcerer\n\nHexblade Warlock\n\nBladesinging Wizard\n\nYou can unlock each new subclass after you reach each required level, which will change depending on your class. For instance, a Cleric, Sorcerer, Paladin or Warlock can choose a new subclass at Level 1, but a Druid and Wizard must wait until Level 2. A Barbarian, Bard, Fighter, Monk, Ranger or Rogue must wait until Level 3.\n\nLarian Studios\n\nPhoto mode is a game changer for creators\n\nIf you've ever wanted to freeze the action and line up the perfect screenshot (or just fawn over Astarion in the moonlight), now's your chance. Patch 8 for Baldur's Gate 3 introduces an official photo mode, and it's more than just a camera tool. Players can adjust lighting, add filters, change facial expressions, shift character poses and more -- all in real time.\n\nPhoto mode can be activated by pressing F9 on PC or clicking both thumbsticks on a controller. You can use it during combat or exploration, though it won't be available during dialogue or prerendered scenes. Once snapped, images are saved directly to your system, whether you're on a PC, a Mac or a console.\n\nSteam cards, modding tools and a farewell short\n\nPatch 8 for Baldur's Gate 3 gives PC players something extra to look forward to: Steam Trading Cards are now live. Collecting them lets you craft profile badges and unlock exclusive emotes and backgrounds tied to Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nThe patch also brings improvements to Larian's official modding tools. Creators now have more freedom to add NPCs, create interactive environments and build new experiences within the existing world -- though editing fixed terrain is still off-limits for now.\n\nTo mark the arrival of the final Baldur's Gate 3 update, Larian released a lighthearted animated short featuring the game's main cast and a cameo from studio founder Swen Vincke. It's a charming little tribute that reminds players just how much personality the team brought to this RPG. If you haven't played it yet, you're probably going to want to after this.\n\nNo DLC coming, but support continues\n\nLarian has confirmed that Patch 8 is the final major update for Baldur's Gate 3. There are no expansions or sequels in the pipeline, and the team is officially moving on to new projects. However, that doesn't mean the game is being left behind entirely. Bug fixes, quality-of-life tweaks and backend improvements will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn the meantime, this final patch is a powerful way to wrap up this epic role-playing game. It smooths out rough edges, adds meaningful content and gives players new tools to enjoy the game in even more creative ways. Whether you're rolling a new character, testing out a subclass or finally convincing your Xbox friend to join your campaign, Patch 8 makes Baldur's Gate 3 feel new again, just in time to say goodbye.\n\nYou can read the full patch notes here."

            "content": "My favorite replaceable-battery powered security camera, the Blink Outdoor, is getting an update! Why is it my favorite? Well, there aren't many. Most outdoor security cameras use some variant of power cables, rechargeable batteries, and perhaps solar to top the power up. Not Amazon-owned company Blink, though, which offers a useful alternative in the form of disposable batteries which have a much longer life but still don't need any cable runs.\n\nOf course it's useful for Amazon too – where do most people go to buy the AA lithium batteries? Nevertheless there are scenarios where they make sense, and the previous generations have proven that.\n\nWhat does the new Blink Outdoor 4th generation, just announced, bring to the party?\n\nMore onboard processing power which enables more features. An on-device AI enables advanced motion detection with customisable dual zones and Person Detection (subscription required). This allows users to receive more specific motion alerts, filtering out unwanted notifications.\n\n(Image credit: Blink / Amazon)\n\nThere is also the option of even longer life from the same I personally used a Blink Outdoor and found the battery life really did live up to expectations, though I was careful not to over-activate it.\n\nThe camera maintains the signature battery life of up to two years on two (lithium) AA batteries. The system includes the new Blink Sync Module Core, which facilitates cloud storage for recorded footage.\n\nYou can boost that (perhaps if you're putting the camera in a busier location where it'll be activated more and use the batteries faster) with the new Battery Extension Pack. This doubles the battery life – either to a remarkable four years or, as I said, more likely, more activations in the same time!\n\nGet the Digital Camera World Newsletter The best camera deals, reviews, product advice, and unmissable photography news, direct to your inbox!

A bundle including the camera and the Battery Extension Pack is available for $64.99 / £89.99, and the Battery Extension Pack can be purchased separately for $29.99 / £24.99.\n\nYou might also like\n\nCheck our guide to the best indoor security camera and the best outdoor security camera.
