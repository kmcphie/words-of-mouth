# Problem & Overview
Many people want to be more mindful and informed, but life gets busy. By stacking small, positive routines with the habit most people already have of brushing their teeth twice a day, people can make small yet powerful changes in life that will add up.

# Description
When brushing teeth in the morning, you could get a personalized recap of important news stories from the previous day, an update on stocks you follow, reminders of upcoming appointments or tasks of the day, a weather alert, or a prompt to complete a small personal morning ritual such as gratitude or prayer. 

When brushing teeth in the evening, you could get a prompt to reflect on your day, listen to a short voice memo submitted by a friend, or review the tasks you were able to accomplish that day.

# Team
This project was created for the Harvard WiCS x Anthropic Hackathon, April 2025. Team members: Aida Baradari, Lizzy Brahin, Katherine McPhie, Michael Pocress, and Peggy Yin.
